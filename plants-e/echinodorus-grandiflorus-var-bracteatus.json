    "intro": "Echinodorus grandiflorus var. bracteatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved cabomba, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, waxy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a reddish or purple tint on the underside. The plant produces small, white, floating flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a desirable and potentially invasive species in certain ecosystems."
