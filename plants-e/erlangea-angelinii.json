    "intro": "Erlangea angelinii, commonly known as the angel's lace, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, upright stem and exhibits a unique branching pattern that resembles lace, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erlangea angelinii is considered a conservation concern."
