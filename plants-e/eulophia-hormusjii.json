    "intro": "Eulophia hormusjii, commonly known as the Hormuz orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
