    "intro": "Euphorbia taruensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian spurge, is a shrub native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which is a common trait among members of its family. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues. Euphorbia taruensis is often found in rocky areas and has a relatively low growth habit."
