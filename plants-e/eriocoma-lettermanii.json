    "intro": "Eriocoma lettermanii, commonly known as the Letterman's eriocoma, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
