    "intro": "Eucalyptus balladoniensis subsp. sedens, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, felt-like hairs. The flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are usually pale yellow to cream in color, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various native wildlife species."
