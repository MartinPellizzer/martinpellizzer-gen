It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds.
