    "intro": "Euphorbia furcata, commonly known as the forked spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a green, fleshy structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is necessary when handling or planting this species."
