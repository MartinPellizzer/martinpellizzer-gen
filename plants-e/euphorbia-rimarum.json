    "intro": "Euphorbia rimarum, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes, thriving in full sun. Euphorbia rimarum is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
