It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
