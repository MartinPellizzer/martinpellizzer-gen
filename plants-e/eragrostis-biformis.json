    "intro": "Eragrostis biformis, commonly known as the two-awned lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two awns, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Eragrostis biformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
