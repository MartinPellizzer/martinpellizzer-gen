    "intro": "Eriogonum jamesii var. rupicola, commonly known as the desert monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and dry soils, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are generally small, hairy, and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
