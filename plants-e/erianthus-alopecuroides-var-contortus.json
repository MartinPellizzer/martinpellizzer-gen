    "intro": "Erianthus alopecuroides var. contortus, commonly known as twisted bluemink grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often curl or twist, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in loose panicles. It prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, pond edges, and other riparian habitats. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control in wetland restoration projects."
