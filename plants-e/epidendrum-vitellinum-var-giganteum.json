    "intro": "Epidendrum vitellinum var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant yellow orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, with a vibrant yellow coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. The flowers bloom in clusters, often lasting several weeks, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
