    "intro": "Eragrostis cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoba grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
