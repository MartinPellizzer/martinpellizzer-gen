    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 campanifructa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color, which are arranged in clusters. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. This species is often found in open woodlands and heathlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
