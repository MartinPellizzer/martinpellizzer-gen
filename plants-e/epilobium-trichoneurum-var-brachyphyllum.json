    "intro": "Epilobium trichoneurum var. brachyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often disturbed habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Onagraceae family. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
