    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus phyllacanthus var. micracanthus, commonly known as the narrow-spined pebble cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its foliage consists of short, cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, aiding in water retention. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils with minimal water."
