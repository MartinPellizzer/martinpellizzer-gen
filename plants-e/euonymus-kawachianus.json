    "intro": "Euonymus kawachianus, commonly known as the Kawachian burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red foliage in the fall, which gives it its common name. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green in summer and turn strikingly colorful in autumn. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. Euonymus kawachianus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
