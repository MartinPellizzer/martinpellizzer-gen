    "intro": "Echeveria subsessilis, commonly known as the compact echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth habit, it is popular as a potted plant and for rock garden displays."
