    "intro": "Enslenia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a dense, upright cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the base of the leaves, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Enslenia ligulata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
