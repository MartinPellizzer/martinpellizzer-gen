    "intro": "Elaphoglossum sancti-gabrielis, commonly known as the Gabriel's fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum sancti-gabrielis is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
