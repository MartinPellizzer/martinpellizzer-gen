    "intro": "Enchylaena microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved broom, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Enchylaena microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance."
