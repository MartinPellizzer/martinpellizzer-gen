    "intro": "Eragrostis reptans var. contracta, commonly known as narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or pale yellow in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its natural habitat."
