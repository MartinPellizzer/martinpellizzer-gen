    "intro": "Eumachia novohiberiensis, commonly known as the New Hiberian Balm, is a flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Novohiberian archipelago. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a velvety underside and produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which emit a subtle mint-like scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Due to its unique fragrance and ornamental value, it is also studied for potential medicinal properties."
