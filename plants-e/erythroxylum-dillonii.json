    "intro": "Erythroxylum dillonii, commonly known as the Dillon's coca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids in its leaves, which have historically been used for various purposes, including traditional medicine. However, it is not as well-known as other coca species and is less commonly cultivated for commercial use."
