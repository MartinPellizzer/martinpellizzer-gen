It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in wetland areas, rice fields, and disturbed soils. This variant is closely related to other Echinochloa species and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
