    "intro": "Ehretia lamarckii, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate, opposite leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
