    "intro": "Epidendrum tomentosum, commonly known as the velvet epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum tomentosum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
