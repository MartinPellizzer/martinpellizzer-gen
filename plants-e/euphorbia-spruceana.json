It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among species in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Euphorbia spruceana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
