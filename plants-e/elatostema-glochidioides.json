    "intro": "Elatostema glochidioides, commonly known as the needleleaf elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its opposite, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
