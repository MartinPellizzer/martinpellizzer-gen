    "intro": "Erythronium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf fritillary, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces a single upright stem that bears a cluster of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers with prominent, contrasting markings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The broadleaf fritillary is a valued plant in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
