    "intro": "Elytrigia setulifera, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and other damp habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
