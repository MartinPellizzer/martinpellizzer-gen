    "intro": "Eremanthus stellatus var. pohlianus, commonly known as the Pohli's eremanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clustered, small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
