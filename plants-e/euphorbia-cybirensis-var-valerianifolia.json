It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often green with a reddish tinge, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in cyathia. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. It has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
