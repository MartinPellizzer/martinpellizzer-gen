    "intro": "Eriosema montanum var. grande, commonly known as the large-leaved eriosema, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers with prominent stamens. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
