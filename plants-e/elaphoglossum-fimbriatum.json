    "intro": "Elaphoglossum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided, serrated margins that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium. Elaphoglossum fimbriatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
