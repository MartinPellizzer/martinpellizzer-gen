    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 laxus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and tufted inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense vegetation. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in various environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
