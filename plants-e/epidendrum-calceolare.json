    "intro": "Epidendrum calceolare, commonly known as the shoeplant, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to grow in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often resembling a cluster of shoes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum calceolare is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
