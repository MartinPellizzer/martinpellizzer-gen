    "intro": "Elaeocarpus floribundus var. tahanensis, commonly known as the Tahan mountain elaeocarpus, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, edible seeds. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
