It is a low-growing perennial herb with fine, hairy leaves and small, blue-to-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
