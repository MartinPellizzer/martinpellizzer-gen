    "intro": "Erica plukenetii var. densa, commonly known as the dense heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the warmer months. The plant is well adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal. Erica plukenetii var. densa is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
