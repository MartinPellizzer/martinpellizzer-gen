    "intro": "Excoecaria crenulata, commonly known as the crocodile tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to various environments."
