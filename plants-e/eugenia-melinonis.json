    "intro": "Eugenia melinonis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value has led to its introduction in other parts of the world, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
