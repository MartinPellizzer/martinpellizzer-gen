    "intro": "Erythroxylum compactum, commonly known as the dwarf coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It is notable for its alkaloid content, particularly cocaine, which is found in its leaves. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is classified as a controlled substance in many countries."
