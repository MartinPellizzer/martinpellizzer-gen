    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, providing protection from herbivores. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
