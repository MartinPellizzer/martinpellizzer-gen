    "intro": "Euphorbia humifusa f. glabra, commonly known as smoothleaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features succulent, smooth, and often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
