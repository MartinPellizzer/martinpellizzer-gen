    "intro": "Erica trimera subsp. kilimanjarica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro heath, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of montane habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for endemic species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant species."
