    "intro": "Eupatorium propinquum, commonly known as common boneset, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. It produces showy white to pale purple flowers in late summer, which attract various pollinators. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
