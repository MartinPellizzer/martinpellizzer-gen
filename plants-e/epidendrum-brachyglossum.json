    "intro": "Epidendrum brachyglossum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
