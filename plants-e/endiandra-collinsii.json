    "intro": "Endiandra collinsii, commonly known as the Collins' endiandra, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody structure and dense foliage. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and often have a distinct aromatic scent. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Endiandra collinsii is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
