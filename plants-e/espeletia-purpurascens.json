    "intro": "Espeletia purpurascens, commonly known as the purple velvet bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's survival. The leaves are typically covered in a dense, velvety coating that gives the plant its common name. It produces vibrant pink or purple flowers that bloom in the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. This species is well adapted to high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
