    "intro": "Encholirium, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a genus of flowering plants native to Central and South America. These plants are characterized by their large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect water. Encholirium species are typically evergreen and can grow up to several meters in height. They produce showy, spadix-like flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. Due to their striking appearance and ecological importance, they are often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
