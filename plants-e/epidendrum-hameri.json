    "intro": "Epidendrum hameri, commonly known as the Orchid of the Andes, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often in clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum hameri thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil."
