    "intro": "Epacris densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered epacris, is an evergreen shrub native to the southeastern region of Australia. It belongs to the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Epacris densiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
