It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its structure and appearance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
