    "intro": "Elymus dentatus var. dasyphyllus, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a variant of the toothed grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and distinctive, serrated leaf margins. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid conditions."
