    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. albescens, commonly known as white swamp willow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability to wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
