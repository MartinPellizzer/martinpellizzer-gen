    "intro": "Epiphyllum salmoneum, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming at night. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and horticultural collections."
