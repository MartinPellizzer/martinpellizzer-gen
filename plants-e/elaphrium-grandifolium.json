    "intro": "Elaphrium grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf elaphrium, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in well-drained soils. Elaphrium grandifolium is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it thrives in partial shade."
