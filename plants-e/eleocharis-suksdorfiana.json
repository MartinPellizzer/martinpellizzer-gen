    "intro": "Eleocharis suksdorfiana, commonly known as the Saksdorf sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Eleocharis suksdorfiana plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
