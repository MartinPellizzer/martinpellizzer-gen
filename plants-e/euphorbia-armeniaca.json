    "intro": "Euphorbia armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features succulent, branching stems covered in a distinctive white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a glandular surface that exudes a milky sap. Euphorbia armeniaca is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
