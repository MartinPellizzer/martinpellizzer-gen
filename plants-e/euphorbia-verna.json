    "intro": "Euphorbia verna, commonly known as early euphorbia, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its stems are covered in a white, powdery substance known as a pruina, which helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia verna is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species."
