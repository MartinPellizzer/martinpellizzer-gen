    "intro": "Euphorbia simplex, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with smooth, waxy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Euphorbia simplex is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
