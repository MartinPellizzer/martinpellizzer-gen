    "intro": "Equilabium subincisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals that are slightly notched at the tips. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
