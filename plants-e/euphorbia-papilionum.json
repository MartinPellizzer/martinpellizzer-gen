    "intro": "Euphorbia papilionum, commonly known as the butterfly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with opposite, oblong leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by red bracts that resemble butterfly wings, giving it its common name. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia papilionum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
