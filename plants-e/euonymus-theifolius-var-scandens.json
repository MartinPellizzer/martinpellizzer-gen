    "intro": "Euonymus theifolius var. scandens, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a vigorous, evergreen shrub native to China. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its dense, ground-covering habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
