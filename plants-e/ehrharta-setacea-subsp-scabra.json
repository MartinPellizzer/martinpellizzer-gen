It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are typically rough and hairy, giving it a distinctive texture. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands."
