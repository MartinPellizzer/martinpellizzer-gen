    "intro": "Erica polifolia var. angustata, commonly known as narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. It features dense, evergreen foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
