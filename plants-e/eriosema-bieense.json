    "intro": "Eriosema bieense, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowering stems are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eriosema bieense is adapted to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
