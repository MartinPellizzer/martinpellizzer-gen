    "intro": "Euphorbia chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water. The plant is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
