    "intro": "Eremophila caespitosa, commonly known as the coastal eryngo, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eremophila caespitosa is well-suited to low-water environments and is often used in native gardens."
