It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its slow growth and limited distribution make it a valuable and protected species in botanical conservation efforts."
