    "intro": "Eucalyptus brunnea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, often grey or brownish bark. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically with a pale underside, and they are aromatic when crushed. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
