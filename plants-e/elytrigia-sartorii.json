    "intro": "Elytrigia sartorii, commonly known as the field grass or sartorii grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Elytrigia sartorii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions."
