    "intro": "Eperua venosa, commonly known as the velvetwood tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, while the bark is thick and often covered in a rough, fissured texture. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, brown seeds. This plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
