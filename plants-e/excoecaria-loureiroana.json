    "intro": "Excoecaria loureiroana, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in coastal areas, particularly in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant has thick, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in saline conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces woody, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
