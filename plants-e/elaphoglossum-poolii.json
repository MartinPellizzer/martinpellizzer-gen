    "intro": "Elaphoglossum poolii, commonly known as the Pool's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in distinct rows. Elaphoglossum poolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
