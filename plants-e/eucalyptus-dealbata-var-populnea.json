    "intro": "Eucalyptus dealbata var. populnea, commonly known as the silky gum, is a medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine, silky white coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its timber and medicinal properties."
