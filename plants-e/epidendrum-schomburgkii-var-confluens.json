    "intro": "Epidendrum schomburgkii var. confluens, commonly known as the Florida Ghost Orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
