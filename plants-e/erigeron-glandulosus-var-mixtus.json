    "intro": "Erigeron glandulosus var. mixtus, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It features silvery-blue foliage and produces fluffy white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils."
