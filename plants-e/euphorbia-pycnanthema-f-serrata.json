    "intro": "Euphorbia pycnanthema f. serrata, commonly known as the serrated euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, spineless stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are typically small and may be present or reduced, depending on environmental conditions. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water."
