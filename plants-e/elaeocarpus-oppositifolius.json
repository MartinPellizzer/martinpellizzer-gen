    "intro": "Elaeocarpus oppositifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed elaeocarpus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of lanceolate leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that enclose a single seed. Its bark is thick and corky, providing structural support and resistance to environmental stress. This species is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife."
