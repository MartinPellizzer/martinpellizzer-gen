    "intro": "Euphorbia arnottiana var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically smooth and entire. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
