It features a sprawling growth habit with long, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy surface that gives it a distinctive texture. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
