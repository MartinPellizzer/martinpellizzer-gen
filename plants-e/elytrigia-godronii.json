It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
