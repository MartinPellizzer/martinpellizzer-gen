    "intro": "Euphorbia dilatata, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, spiny, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to regenerate from cuttings. Euphorbia dilatata is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
