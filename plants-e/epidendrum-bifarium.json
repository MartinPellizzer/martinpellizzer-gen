    "intro": "Epidendrum bifarium, commonly known as the two-flowered epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces two-lipped, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum bifarium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a tropical or greenhouse setting."
