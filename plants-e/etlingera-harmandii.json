    "intro": "Etlingera harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's torch ginger, is a tropical plant belonging to the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, red-orange inflorescences that resemble torches, which are composed of numerous small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
