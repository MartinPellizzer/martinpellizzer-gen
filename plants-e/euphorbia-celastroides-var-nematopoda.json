    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. nematopoda, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and fields. Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care."
