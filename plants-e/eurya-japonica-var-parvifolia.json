    "intro": "Eurya japonica var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Japanese holly or small-leaved eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide winter interest with its red berries."
