It features a short, thick, woody stem with a distinctive star-shaped arrangement of leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
