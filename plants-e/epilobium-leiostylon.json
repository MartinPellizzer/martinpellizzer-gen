It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pink to red flowers bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies. Epilobium leiostylon is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
