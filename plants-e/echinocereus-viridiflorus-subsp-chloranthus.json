    "intro": "Echinocereus viridiflorus subsp. chloranthus, commonly known as the green-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of bright green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces berries that are edible for both humans and animals. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
