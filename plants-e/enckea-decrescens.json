    "intro": "Enckea decrescens, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods containing flat, dark seeds. Enckea decrescens is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in musical instruments and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
