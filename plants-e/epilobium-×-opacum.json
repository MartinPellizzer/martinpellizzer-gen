    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 opacum, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows. Epilobium \u00d7 opacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
