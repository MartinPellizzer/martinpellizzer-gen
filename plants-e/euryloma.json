These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting markings. Euryloma species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plants are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
