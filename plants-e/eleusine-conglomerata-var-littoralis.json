It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or bluish-green. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
