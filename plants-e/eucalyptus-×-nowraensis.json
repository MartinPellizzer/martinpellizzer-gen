This plant typically grows in coastal and riverine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, and it is known for its aromatic oils, which contribute to its use in traditional and contemporary herbal applications. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native range."
