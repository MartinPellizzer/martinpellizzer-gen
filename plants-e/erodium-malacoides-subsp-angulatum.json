It is a small annual herb with slender stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that have a distinctive angular appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new habitats."
