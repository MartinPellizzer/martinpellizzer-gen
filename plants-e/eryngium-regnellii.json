    "intro": "Eryngium regnellii, commonly known as the blue thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features striking blue to purple spiky flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine bristles. Its sturdy stems rise from the center, supporting the flower heads that resemble thistle-like structures. Eryngium regnellii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes."
