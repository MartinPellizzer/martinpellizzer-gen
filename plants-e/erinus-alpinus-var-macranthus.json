    "intro": "Erinus alpinus var. macranthus, commonly known as the Alpine Erinus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces numerous hairy stems covered with fine, silver-gray foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early summer."
