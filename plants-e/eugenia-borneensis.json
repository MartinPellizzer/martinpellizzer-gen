    "intro": "Eugenia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible, fragrant fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a unique flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and potential economic importance, it is of interest for conservation and horticultural research."
