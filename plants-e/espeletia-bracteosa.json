    "intro": "Espeletia bracteosa, commonly known as the \"Puya raimondii\" or the \"Queen of the Andes,\" is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky rosette of leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach up to 10 meters in height, bearing numerous small, bell-shaped flowers. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in the harsh, cold, and dry conditions of the Andean highlands. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for both scientific study and conservation efforts."
