    "intro": "Erica versicolor var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring dense, wiry stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a distinctive ciliate (fringed) margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Erica versicolor var. ciliata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is well-suited to rock gardens or coastal landscapes."
