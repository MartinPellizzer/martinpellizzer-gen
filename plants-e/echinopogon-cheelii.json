    "intro": "Echinopogon cheelii, commonly known as the Cheel's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, spikelet-like flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Echinopogon cheelii is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, showcasing its resilience to coastal conditions."
