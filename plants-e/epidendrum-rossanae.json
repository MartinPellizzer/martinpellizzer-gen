    "intro": "Epidendrum rossanae, commonly known as the Rossana's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically features fleshy, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum rossanae is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
