It features broad, elongated leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, giving it a dramatic appearance in freshwater aquariums. The plant thrives in moderate to high light conditions and requires regular fertilization to maintain its lush green coloration. It is often used as a background plant due to its height and dense foliage. Additionally, it produces small white flowers that bloom during the warmer months, adding to its ornamental value."
