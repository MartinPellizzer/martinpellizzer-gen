    "intro": "Euphorbia campestris, commonly known as the field spurge, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features a branched stem with alternate, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is surrounded by yellowish-green bracts. The sap of Euphorbia campestris is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
