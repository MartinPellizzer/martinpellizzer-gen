    "intro": "Eugenia crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple to black berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
