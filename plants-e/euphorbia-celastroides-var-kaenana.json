    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. kaenana, commonly known as the Kaena euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered an important species in Hawaiian flora."
