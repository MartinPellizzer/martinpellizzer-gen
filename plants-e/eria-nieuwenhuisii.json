    "intro": "Eria nieuwenhuisii, commonly known as the Nieuwenhuis's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without being parasitic. The flowers bloom during the wet season, making it a valuable addition to tropical gardens."
