    "intro": "Ericoides planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Ericoides planifolium thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
