    "intro": "Epicharis triangularis, commonly known as the triangular euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a touch of color to its otherwise muted appearance. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and low maintenance requirements. Epicharis triangularis is also known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and full sun exposure."
