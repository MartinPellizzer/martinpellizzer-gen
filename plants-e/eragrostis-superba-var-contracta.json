It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate drought, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
