It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its characteristic floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used in herbal remedies, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling."
