    "intro": "Echinocereus viridiflorus var. tubulosus, commonly known as the greenflower hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red to purple fruits that are edible and often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for arid gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to desert environments and can survive prolonged droughts."
