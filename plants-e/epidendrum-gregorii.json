    "intro": "Epidendrum gregorii, commonly known as the Gregorii's orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Epidendrum gregorii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
