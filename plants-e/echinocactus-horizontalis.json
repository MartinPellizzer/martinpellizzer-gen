    "intro": "Echinocactus horizontalis, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, forming a dense, bushy structure. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its spiny, cylindrical stems are adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in harsh desert conditions. Echinocactus horizontalis is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight."
