    "intro": "Euphorbia cap-saintemariensis, commonly known as the Sainte-Marie euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
