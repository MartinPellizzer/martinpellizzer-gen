    "intro": "Epicharis angustifoliola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved epicharis, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible and have a slightly sweet, tangy flavor. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
