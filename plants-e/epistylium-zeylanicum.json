    "intro": "Epistylium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Indian epistylium, is a colonial marine algae belonging to the order Rhodophyta. It forms dense, bushy colonies that are often found attached to substrates such as shells, stones, or other marine organisms. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure composed of numerous filaments and protuberances, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its reddish coloration is due to the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment common in red algae. Epistylium zeylanicum plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
