    "intro": "Euphorbia grandicornis subsp. sejuncta, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features distinctive, spiky, green to yellowish stems that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care."
