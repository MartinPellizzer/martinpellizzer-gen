    "intro": "Echinolytrum verruciferum, commonly known as the rough-horned poppy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky seed pods and showy, often red or orange, flowers. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are usually lobed and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
