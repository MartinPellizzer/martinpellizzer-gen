    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaesyce var. glabra, commonly known as petty spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a succulent, branched stem covered in small, green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and toxic sap."
