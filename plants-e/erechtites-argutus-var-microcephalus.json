    "intro": "Erechtites argutus var. microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed marsh lettuce, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with smaller, alternate leaves along its stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose, branched cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
