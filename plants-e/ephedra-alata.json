    "intro": "Ephedra alata, commonly known as the jointed ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow-green flowers and red-brown fruits, which contain seeds. Ephedra alata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems. It is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
