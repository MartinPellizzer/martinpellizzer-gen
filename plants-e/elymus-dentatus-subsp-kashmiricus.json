    "intro": "Elymus dentatus subsp. kashmiricus, commonly known as Kashmir wild rye, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous environments."
