    "intro": "Eleocharis affinis, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dry, three-lobed berries. Eleocharis affinis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
