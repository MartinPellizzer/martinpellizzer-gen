It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, vibrant flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces edible seeds that are traditionally used in local cuisines. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its aggressive spread."
