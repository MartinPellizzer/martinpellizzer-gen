    "intro": "Encyclia diota, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that typically feature red or orange tips on the petals. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal environments. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces clusters of fragrant flowers during the wet season. Encyclia diota is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
