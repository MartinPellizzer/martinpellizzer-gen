    "intro": "Eritrichium oliganthum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of delicate blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Eritrichium oliganthum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
