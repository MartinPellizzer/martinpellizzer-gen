    "intro": "Erythraea compressa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small, deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that are typically followed by small, red or orange fruits. Its leaves and stems contain compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Erythraea compressa is now considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
