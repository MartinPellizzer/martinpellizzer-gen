    "intro": "Echinocereus acifer var. durangensis, commonly known as the Durango cholla, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico. It features cylindrical stems covered in clusters of spiny, green to reddish-brown tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water needs and ornamental appeal."
