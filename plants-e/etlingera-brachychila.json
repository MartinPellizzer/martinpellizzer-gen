    "intro": "Etlingera brachychila, commonly known as the short-stemmed torch ginger, is a tropical plant belonging to the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its striking, red-orange inflorescences that resemble torches. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its humid, tropical habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered around a central spadix, a common feature in the ginger family. Etlingera brachychila is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
