    "intro": "Eupatorium cursonii, commonly known as Curson's boneset, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium cursonii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
