    "intro": "Elaphoglossum anthracinum, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed water fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored dust, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a characteristic feature of many ferns. This species is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to thrive in high humidity and nutrient-rich soils."
