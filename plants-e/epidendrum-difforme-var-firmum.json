    "intro": "Epidendrum difforme var. firmum, commonly known as the firmum epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, particularly in regions with warm, humid climates. The plant produces striking, long-lasting orchid flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
