    "intro": "Echinocereus longisetus subsp. delaetii, commonly known as the Delaet's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a columnar stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and bats. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
