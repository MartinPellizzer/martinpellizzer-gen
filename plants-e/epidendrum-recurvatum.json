    "intro": "Epidendrum recurvatum, commonly known as the curly lip orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, violet to pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
