    "intro": "Euonymus uniflorus, commonly known as the one-flowered woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in woodland habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
