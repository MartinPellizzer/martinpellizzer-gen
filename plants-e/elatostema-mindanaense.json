    "intro": "Elatostema mindanaense, commonly known as the Mindanao Elatostema, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is a small herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically found at the axils of the leaves. It is native to the Philippines, particularly in the Mindanao region, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
