    "intro": "Epidendrum brachyschistum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum brachyschistum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
