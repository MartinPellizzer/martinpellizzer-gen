    "intro": "Epipactis abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian helleborine, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Ethiopia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive spurred petals, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as montane forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
