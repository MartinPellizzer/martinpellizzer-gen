    "intro": "Euphorbia tithymaloides subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
