It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright pink or red blooms during the late spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives it its common name. This species is well adapted to acidic, sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
