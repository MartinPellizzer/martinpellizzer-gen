    "intro": "Echites madidus, commonly known as the water lily of the tropics, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It thrives in shallow freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes, where it plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems. The plant's leaves are typically green and waxy, with a prominent central vein, while its flowers can range in color from white to pink or purple. Echites madidus reproduces through both sexual pollination and vegetative propagation, allowing it to spread efficiently in suitable environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological balance and ornamental horticulture."
