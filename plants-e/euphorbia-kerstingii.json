    "intro": "Euphorbia kerstingii, commonly known as the Kersting's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
