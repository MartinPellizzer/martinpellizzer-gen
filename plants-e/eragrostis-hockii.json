    "intro": "Eragrostis hockii, commonly known as Hock's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Eragrostis hockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
