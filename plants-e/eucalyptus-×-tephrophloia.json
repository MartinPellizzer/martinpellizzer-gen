    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 tephrophloia, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus fibrosa and Eucalyptus tephrophylla. It is a tall, slender tree that typically grows in cooler, wetter regions of southeastern Australia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, fissured bark and lance-shaped, mid to dark green leaves. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is valued for its timber and has been used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability to various soil types."
