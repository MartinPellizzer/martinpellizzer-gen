    "intro": "Ephedra pachyclada subsp. pachyclada, commonly known as the desert tea or jointed ephedra, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its stout, woody stems that are often branched and covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant is known for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its alkaloids, such as ephedrine, have raised concerns regarding safety and regulation."
