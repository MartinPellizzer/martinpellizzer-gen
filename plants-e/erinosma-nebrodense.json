    "intro": "Erinosma nebrodense, commonly known as the Nebrodian erinose, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
