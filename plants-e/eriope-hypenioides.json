    "intro": "Eriope hypenioides, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of soft, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriope hypenioides is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, drought-resistant appearance."
