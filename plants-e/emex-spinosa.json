    "intro": "Emex spinosa, commonly known as the spiny emex, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a stout, upright stem covered in sharp, spiny bracts that deter herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Emex spinosa is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
