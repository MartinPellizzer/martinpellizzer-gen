It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky habitats. It has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss through transpiration. The flowers bloom in the summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
