    "intro": "Euchiton lateralis, commonly known as the slender euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features erect, branching stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive reddish hue on the underside. Euchiton lateralis is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
