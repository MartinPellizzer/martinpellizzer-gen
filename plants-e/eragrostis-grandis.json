    "intro": "Eragrostis grandis, commonly known as large sprangletop, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for weeds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is adapted to survive in arid conditions with minimal water. Eragrostis grandis is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
