    "intro": "Elaeagnus siphonantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-white foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red berries. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Elaeagnus siphonantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
