    "intro": "Euphrasia litoralis, commonly known as the seaside eyebright, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy environments. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Euphrasia litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators."
