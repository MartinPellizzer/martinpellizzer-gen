    "intro": "Euphorbia glareosa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia or rock spurge, is a compact, succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, fleshy foliage with a bluish-green hue and produces striking yellow-orange cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and ability to form a low, mat-like structure make it an attractive addition to arid landscapes. It is also noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
