    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. leptochila, commonly known as the slender-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to other members of the Epipactis genus."
