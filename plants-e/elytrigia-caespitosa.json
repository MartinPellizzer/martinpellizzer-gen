    "intro": "Elytrigia caespitosa, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Elytrigia caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
