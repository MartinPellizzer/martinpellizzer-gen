    "intro": "Elegia filacea, commonly known as the silky filaree, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing perennial that produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with slender, thread-like petals. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a silky texture. Elegia filacea is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
