    "intro": "Euphorbia proballyana, commonly known as the Proballyan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
