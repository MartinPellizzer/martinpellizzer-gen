    "intro": "Elaeocarpus rosselensis, commonly known as the Rossel elaeocarp, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to New Caledonia, an island in the South Pacific Ocean, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and showy, pale blue or white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a thick, fleshy coating. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
