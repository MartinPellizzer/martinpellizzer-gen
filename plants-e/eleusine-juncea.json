The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and extensive, allowing it to thrive in various soil types and climates. Eleusine juncea is also valued for its use in livestock feed and as a soil stabilizer in erosion-prone areas."
