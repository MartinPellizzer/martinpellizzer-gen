    "intro": "Ephedra fragilis var. cossonii, commonly known as the brittle ephedra, is a dioecious shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
