    "intro": "Euphorbia dulcis var. alpigena, commonly known as the Alpine sweet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
