    "intro": "Eria lacinulata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with densely packed, bipinnate leaves that are often bright green and glossy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Eria lacinulata is well-suited for indoor cultivation and requires consistent moisture and indirect light to flourish."
