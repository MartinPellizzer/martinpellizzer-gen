    "intro": "Ecbolium gendarussa, commonly known as the Gendarussa orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and its leaves are often broad and waxy to reduce water loss. Ecbolium gendarussa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
