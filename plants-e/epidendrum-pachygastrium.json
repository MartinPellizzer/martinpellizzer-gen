    "intro": "Epidendrum pachygastrium, commonly known as the thick-stemmed epidendron, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy stems and large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its native arid conditions. Epidendrum pachygastrium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
