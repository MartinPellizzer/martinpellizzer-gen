    "intro": "Eucalyptus polycarpa var. oligocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that typically open to reveal white or pink flowers. Its bark is often flaky and peels in strips, a common feature among many eucalyptus species. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
