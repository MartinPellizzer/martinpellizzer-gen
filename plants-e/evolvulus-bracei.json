    "intro": "Evolvulus bracei, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces small, round, green fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its rapid growth and ability to reseed itself make it a common weed in desert regions."
