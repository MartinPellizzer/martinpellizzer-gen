It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and meadow habitats. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branched. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
