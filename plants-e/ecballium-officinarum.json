    "intro": "Ecballium officinarum, commonly known as the horse-gram or wild cucumber, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is an annual herbaceous plant that grows up to 1\u20132 meters tall, characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, green, spiny fruits that resemble cucumbers, which contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous, fleshy outer layer. Ecballium officinarum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural fields and gardens."
