    "intro": "Euphoria obtusa, commonly known as the blunt euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Euphoria obtusa is well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
