    "intro": "Euhaynaldia insignis, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as bogs, marshes, and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Euhaynaldia insignis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological stability."
