    "intro": "Euphorbia sphaerococca, commonly known as the globe spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, green, fleshy leaves that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
