    "intro": "Epidendrum ornithidii, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, with a range of hues including yellow, orange, and red, and they bloom during the warmer months. Epidendrum ornithidii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
