    "intro": "Euphorbia depauperata var. trachycarpa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
