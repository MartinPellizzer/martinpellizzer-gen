    "intro": "Ericoides triste, commonly known as the sad eric, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Ericoides triste is considered a rare and endangered species."
