    "intro": "Euphorbia hirta var. destituta, commonly known as the \"Indian spurge\" or \"buttercup spurge,\" is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. Due to its milky sap, it is considered a potential allergen and should be handled with care."
