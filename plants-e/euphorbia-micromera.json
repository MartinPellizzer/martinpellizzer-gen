    "intro": "Euphorbia micromera, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, low-growing structure with small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
