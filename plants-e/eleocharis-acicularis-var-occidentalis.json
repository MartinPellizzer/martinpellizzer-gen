    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water bodies, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a range of water depths and soil types."
