    "intro": "Ervum lenticulosum, commonly known as the broad bean, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces pods that contain several round, edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. Ervum lenticulosum is often cultivated for both its seeds and as a green manure crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
