    "intro": "Epimedium, commonly known as barberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. These plants are native to Asia, particularly China, and are characterized by their evergreen foliage and showy, pink or red flowers. Epimedium species typically grow in woodland areas and thrive in partial shade, making them popular in ornamental gardening. Their leaves are often leathery and have a distinctive shape, while the flowers appear in early spring. The genus includes over 50 species, many of which are valued for their ornamental appeal and hardiness."
