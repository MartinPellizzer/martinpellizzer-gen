    "intro": "Eulophia caricifolia, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescence bearing numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often submerged in water, adapting it to wetland habitats. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy or aquatic environments. Eulophia caricifolia is a perennial herb that thrives in marshy areas and is often found in association with other water plants."
