    "intro": "Eumecanthus monanthus, commonly known as the single-flower mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in humid, forested environments. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. Its small, white or pale green flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The berries it produces are usually red or yellow, providing food for various bird species."
