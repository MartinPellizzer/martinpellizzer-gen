    "intro": "Euphorbia pubera, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in prairies and disturbed soils. Euphorbia pubera is known for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
