    "intro": "Evolvulus ericifolius, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, often succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Evolvulus ericifolius is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions."
