    "intro": "Erica copiosa var. parvisepala, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to form attractive, low-growing mounds in gardens."
