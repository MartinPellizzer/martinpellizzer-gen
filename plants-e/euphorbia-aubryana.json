It features a distinctive appearance with thick, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces unique floral structures called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its sharp spines, it requires careful handling to avoid injury."
