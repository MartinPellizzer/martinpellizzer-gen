    "intro": "Equisetum bolivianum, commonly known as the Bolivian horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in clusters. Equisetum bolivianum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
