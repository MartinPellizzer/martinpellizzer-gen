    "intro": "Ermania koelzii, commonly known as the Koelz's ermania, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ermania koelzii is considered a vulnerable species."
