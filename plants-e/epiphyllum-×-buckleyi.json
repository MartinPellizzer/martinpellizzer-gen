    "intro": "Epiphyllum \u00d7 buckleyi, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often mistaken for leaves, which are actually modified stems adapted for photosynthesis. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
