    "intro": "Euphorbia ramosa var. villosior, commonly known as the hairy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its branching stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
