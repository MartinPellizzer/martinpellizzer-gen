    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. nudum, commonly known as the naked horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that lacks the typical spore-bearing cones found in other equisetum species. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green and covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
