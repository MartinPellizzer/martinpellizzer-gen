    "intro": "Euphorbia flavicoma subsp. bermejense, commonly known as the yellow-flowered euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to scales or spines, a feature common in xerophytic plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to dry environments."
