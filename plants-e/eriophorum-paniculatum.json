    "intro": "Eriophorum paniculatum, commonly known as cotton grass, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in panicles. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Eriophorum paniculatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
