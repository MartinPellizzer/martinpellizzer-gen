    "intro": "Euphorbia flavicoma var. mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolensis Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that are typically green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens."
