It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The leaves and fruits have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
