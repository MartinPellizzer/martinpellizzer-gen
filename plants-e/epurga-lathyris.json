    "intro": "Epurga lathyris, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
