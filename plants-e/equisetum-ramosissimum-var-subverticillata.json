    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. subverticillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Equisetales. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a distinctive, unbranched stem that is often ribbed. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its morphology reflects its ancient evolutionary lineage. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and narrower leaves compared to other equisetum species."
