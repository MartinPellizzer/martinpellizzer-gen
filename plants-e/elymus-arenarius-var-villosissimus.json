    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. villosissimus, commonly known as the silky sandreed, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, thriving in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. This grass is often used for erosion control and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland landscapes."
