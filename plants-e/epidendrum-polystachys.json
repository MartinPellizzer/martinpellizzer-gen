It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often white or pale pink, and they bloom during the winter months, hence its common name. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive in cultivation."
