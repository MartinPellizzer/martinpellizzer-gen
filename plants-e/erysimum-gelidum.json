    "intro": "Erysimum gelidum, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the European Alps and surrounding regions. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Erysimum gelidum is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens or alpine displays."
