    "intro": "Ericoides chrysanthum, commonly known as the golden heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Ericoides chrysanthum plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
