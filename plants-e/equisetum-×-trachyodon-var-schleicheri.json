    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 trachyodon var. schleicheri, commonly known as the Schleicher's horsetail, is a hybrid variety of the horsetail plant. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stems, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
