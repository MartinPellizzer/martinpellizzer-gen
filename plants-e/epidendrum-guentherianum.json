    "intro": "Epidendrum guentherianum, commonly known as the Guenther's epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and segmented, and it has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Epidendrum guentherianum is relatively easy to care for and is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
