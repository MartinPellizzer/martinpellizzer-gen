    "intro": "Echinops sultanabadensis, commonly known as the Sultanabad thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, hot climates. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters at the top of the plant, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
