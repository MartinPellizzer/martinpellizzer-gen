    "intro": "Euphorbia otjipembana subsp. okakoraensis, commonly known as the Okakoraena euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Namibia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
