    "intro": "Eriophorum chamissonis subsp. aquatile, commonly known as the water cottongrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton balls, which are composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in peat bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
