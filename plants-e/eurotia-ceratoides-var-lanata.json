    "intro": "Eurotia ceratoides var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly coralroot, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique appearance, featuring a dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
