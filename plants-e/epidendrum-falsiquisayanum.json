    "intro": "Epidendrum falsiquisayanum, commonly known as the False Quisayas Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and they are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Epidendrum falsiquisayanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
