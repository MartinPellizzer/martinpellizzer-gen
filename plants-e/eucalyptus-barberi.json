    "intro": "Eucalyptus barberi, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey to black bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a rough, leathery texture. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
