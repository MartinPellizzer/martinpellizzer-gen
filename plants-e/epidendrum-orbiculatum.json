    "intro": "Epidendrum orbiculatum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in a spiral arrangement along the inflorescence. Epidendrum orbiculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
