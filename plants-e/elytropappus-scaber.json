    "intro": "Elytropappus scaber, commonly known as the roughleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gravelly soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The yellow flowers appear in late summer and are followed by small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
