    "intro": "Enodium caeruleum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf bluebell, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep blue-green in color, which help it stand out in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range from pale blue to violet, blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in conservation areas and botanical gardens."
