    "intro": "Eremopyrum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate wild oat, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Eremopyrum prostratum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats."
