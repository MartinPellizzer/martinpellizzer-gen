    "intro": "Edwardsia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered edwardsia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and attractive foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers, which can be blue or violet in color, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Edwardsia grandiflora is considered a vulnerable species."
