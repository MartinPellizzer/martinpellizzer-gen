    "intro": "Eulophia corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered spathephyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. This terrestrial orchid features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering stems. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its inflorescence produces a dense cluster of fragrant, showy flowers. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with contrasting patterns. Eulophia corymbosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
