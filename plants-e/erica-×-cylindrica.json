The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. Erica \u00d7 cylindrica is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and strong winds. Its foliage remains evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
