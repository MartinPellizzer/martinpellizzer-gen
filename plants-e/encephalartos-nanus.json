    "intro": "Encephalartos nanus, commonly known as the miniature cycad, is a compact cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and distinctive, feather-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being more rounded. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, dry climate. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
