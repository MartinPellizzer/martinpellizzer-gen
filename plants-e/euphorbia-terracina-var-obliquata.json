It features erect, branched stems that are often covered in a waxy, pale green cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slight pubescence. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in arid and semi-arid regions."
