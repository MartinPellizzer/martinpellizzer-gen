    "intro": "Epidendrum eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum eggersii is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
