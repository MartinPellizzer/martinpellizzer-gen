    "intro": "Eriogonum caespitosum subsp. ramosum, commonly known as sticky bursage, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, grayish-green leaves covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for drought conditions and ecological restoration projects."
