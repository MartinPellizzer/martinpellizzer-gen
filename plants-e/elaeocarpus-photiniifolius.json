    "intro": "Elaeocarpus photiniifolius, commonly known as the flame tree or photiniifolius elaeocarpus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, greyish bark and elliptical to lance-shaped leaves. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display."
