    "intro": "Eriogonum vimineum subsp. baileyi, commonly known as Bailey's goatsock, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and canyons. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and small mammals."
