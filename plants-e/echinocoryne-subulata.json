    "intro": "Echinocoryne subulata, commonly known as the slender echinocoryne, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, clustered flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and subulate, meaning they are very pointed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically white or pale green, arranged in umbels, and bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
