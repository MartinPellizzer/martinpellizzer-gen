    "intro": "Eragrostis pilosa subsp. leersioides, commonly known as the woolly bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that becomes more prominent as the plant matures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
