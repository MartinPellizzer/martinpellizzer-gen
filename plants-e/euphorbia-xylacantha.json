    "intro": "Euphorbia xylacantha, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features striking, spiky red bracts that surround its yellowish-green flowers, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant has succulent, ribbed stems and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces a milky sap that can be irritating. Euphorbia xylacantha is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
