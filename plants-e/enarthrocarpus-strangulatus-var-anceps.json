    "intro": "Enarthrocarpus strangulatus var. anceps, commonly known as the broad-leaved strangler fig, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, fleshy fruits. The plant is known for its ability to grow rapidly and often forms dense canopies, which can lead to the suppression of other vegetation. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various animals, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood."
