    "intro": "Eriophyllum ambrosiodes, commonly known as woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-white fuzzy foliage and yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
