    "intro": "Eleocharis mamillata, commonly known as the millet sedge, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. Eleocharis mamillata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
