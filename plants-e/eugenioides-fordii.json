    "intro": "Eugenioides fordii, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its rapid growth and attractive foliage. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
