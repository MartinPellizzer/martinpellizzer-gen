    "intro": "Eriophorum lineatum, commonly known as cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the tips of its slender stems. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, marshes, and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Cottongrass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
