    "intro": "Echinopsis fricii, commonly known as the Frici's candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that form a candelabra-like structure, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking white to yellow flowers during the warm season, which are typically borne at the tips of the branches. Its succulent stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Echinopsis fricii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
