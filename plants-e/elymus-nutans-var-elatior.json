    "intro": "Elymus nutans var. elatior, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like foliage that forms a compact clump. The plant produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as prairies and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a forage species."
