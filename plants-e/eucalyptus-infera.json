    "intro": "Eucalyptus infera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringy gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to yellow in color. Its bark is fibrous and peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eucalyptus infera is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland and heathland habitats."
