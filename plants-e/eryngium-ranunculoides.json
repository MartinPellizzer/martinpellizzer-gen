It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Eryngium ranunculoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
