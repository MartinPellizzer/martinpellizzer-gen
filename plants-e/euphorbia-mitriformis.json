    "intro": "Euphorbia mitriformis, commonly known as the helmet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia mitriformis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
