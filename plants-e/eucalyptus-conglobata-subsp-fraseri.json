    "intro": "Eucalyptus conglobata subsp. fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's rough-barked gum, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green color with a rough texture. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
