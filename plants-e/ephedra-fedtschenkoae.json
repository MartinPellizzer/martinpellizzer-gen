    "intro": "Ephedra fedtschenkoae, commonly known as the Tibetan ephedra, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and the presence of specialized structures called phyllodes, which are modified stems that function as leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is known for containing the alkaloid ephedrine, which has medicinal uses. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its ecological significance and medicinal value, it is a subject of both scientific study and conservation interest."
