    "intro": "Endostemon retinervis, commonly known as the slender net-veined plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale blue. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has a fibrous root system and exhibits a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or forested slopes. Its unique venation pattern, with a reticulate network on the underside of the leaves, is a key identifying feature."
