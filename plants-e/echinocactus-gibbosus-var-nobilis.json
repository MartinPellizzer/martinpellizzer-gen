    "intro": "Echinocactus gibbosus var. nobilis, commonly known as the noble prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in arid gardens."
