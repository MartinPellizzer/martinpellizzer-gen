    "intro": "Euphorbia aculeata, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap and spiny structure, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires careful handling."
