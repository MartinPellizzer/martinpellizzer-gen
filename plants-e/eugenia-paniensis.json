    "intro": "Eugenia paniensis, commonly known as the Paniensis guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and elliptical, glossy leaves. It produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct flavor. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Eugenia genus."
