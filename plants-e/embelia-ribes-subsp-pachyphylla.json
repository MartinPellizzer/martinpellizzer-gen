    "intro": "[WRONG START] Embilia ribes subsp. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved embelia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It is often found in dry forests and scrublands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range."
