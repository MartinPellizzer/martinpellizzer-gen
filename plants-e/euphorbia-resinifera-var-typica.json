    "intro": "Euphorbia resinifera var. typica, commonly known as the resinous spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces a milky, toxic latex when damaged, which is a common feature among species in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
