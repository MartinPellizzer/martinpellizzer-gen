    "intro": "Erica pubescens var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are generally smooth and hairless, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
