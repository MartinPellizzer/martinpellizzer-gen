    "intro": "Eugenia vaga var. punicifolia, commonly known as the purple guava, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black fruits, which are typically small and have a fragrant, juicy pulp. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other Eugenia species."
