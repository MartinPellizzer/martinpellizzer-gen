    "intro": "Elyna myosuroides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Elyna myosuroides thrives in high humidity and shaded environments, often found in the canopies of dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
