    "intro": "Empogona ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved sycamore, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. Its dense foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, while its ability to thrive in well-drained soils adds to its adaptability. Empogona ovalifolia is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
