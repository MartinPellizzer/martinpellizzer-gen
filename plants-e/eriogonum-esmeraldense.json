    "intro": "Eriogonum esmeraldense, commonly known as the Emerald Valley buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and bright green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eriogonum esmeraldense plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush habitats."
