    "intro": "Euphorbia dichroa, commonly known as the two-colored spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, contrasting leaf colors, with dark green upper surfaces and pale white or silver undersides. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its toxic sap can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution."
