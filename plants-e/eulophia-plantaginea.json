It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Eulophia plantaginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in tropical gardens for its beauty."
