    "intro": "Elaphoglossum fonkii, commonly known as the Kew fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Elaphoglossum fonkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
