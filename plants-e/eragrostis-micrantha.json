    "intro": "Eragrostis micrantha, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray sheen, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eragrostis micrantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
