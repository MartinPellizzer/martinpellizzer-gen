    "intro": "Euphorbia fusca, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, spiny stems that store water, adapting it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water loss. Euphorbia fusca is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
