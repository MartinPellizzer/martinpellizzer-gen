    "intro": "Elaterium bigelovii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Elaterium bigelovii is adapted to arid environments, with features like reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems to conserve water. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
