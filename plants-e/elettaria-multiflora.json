It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by three-lobed, dark brown fruits containing aromatic seeds. These seeds are highly valued for their strong scent and are used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Elettaria multiflora thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
