    "intro": "Erica axillaris, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Erica axillaris is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
