    "intro": "Eunanus clivicola, commonly known as the cliff-dwelling bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant species native to rocky coastal areas. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Eunanus clivicola is considered a vulnerable species."
