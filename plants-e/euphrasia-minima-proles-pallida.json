    "intro": "Euphrasia minima proles pallida, commonly known as the pale sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, glandular-hairy leaves and small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing numerous tiny flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and fragile species."
