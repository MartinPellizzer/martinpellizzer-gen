    "intro": "Eragrostis purshii var. diffusa, commonly known as hairy lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental potential and its ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal water requirements."
