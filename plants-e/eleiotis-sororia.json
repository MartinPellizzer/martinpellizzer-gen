    "intro": "Eleiotis sororia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with sturdy stems that branch out extensively. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in spikes, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
