    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudoburuana, commonly known as the Buru euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the island of Buru in Indonesia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
