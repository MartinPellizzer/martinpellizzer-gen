    "intro": "Empleurum unicapsularis, commonly known as the single-celled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders that are used for trapping prey. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in size and are attached to slender, thread-like stems. The plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its simple structure and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an interesting subject in the study of aquatic botany."
