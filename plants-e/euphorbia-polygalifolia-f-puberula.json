    "intro": "Euphorbia polygalifolia f. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
