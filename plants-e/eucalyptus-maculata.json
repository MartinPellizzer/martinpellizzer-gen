It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which features patches of rough, flaky bark that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. The flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are borne in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds."
