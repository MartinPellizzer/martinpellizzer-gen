It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the winter months. Its stems are segmented and jointed, with a distinctive, waxy texture. It is popular as a ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
