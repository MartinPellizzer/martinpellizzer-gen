    "intro": "Epipactis nordeniorum subsp. mecsekensis, commonly known as the Mecsek marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mecsek Mountains in Hungary. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. It has a short flowering period in late spring to early summer, and its reproductive strategy relies on specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
