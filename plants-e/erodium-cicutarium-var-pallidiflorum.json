    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. pallidiflorum, commonly known as the paleflower bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with fine, silky hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread easily in new environments."
