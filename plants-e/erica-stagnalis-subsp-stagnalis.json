    "intro": "Erica stagnalis subsp. stagnalis, commonly known as the bog heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the acidic, nutrient-poor habitats of northern Europe. It typically thrives in wet, boggy environments and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its moist but often acidic environment. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes other heathers and related shrubs. Erica stagnalis subsp. stagnalis plays an important role in stabilizing peat soils and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat."
