    "intro": "Euphorbia consoquitlae, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a thick, fleshy stem with small, green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
