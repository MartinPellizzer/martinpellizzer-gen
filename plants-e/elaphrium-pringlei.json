    "intro": "Elaphrium pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's elaphrium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and streamside areas. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Elaphrium pringlei is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
