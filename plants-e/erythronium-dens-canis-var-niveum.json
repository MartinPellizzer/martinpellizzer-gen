    "intro": "Erythronium dens-canis var. niveum, commonly known as the white dog's tooth violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine white down. The plant produces a single, upright stem bearing a showy, bell-shaped flower with white petals and a yellow throat. It thrives in woodland habitats with moist, well-drained soil and partial shade. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration, contrasting with the more typical greenish-yellow of the species."
