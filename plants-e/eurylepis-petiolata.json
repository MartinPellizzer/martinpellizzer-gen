    "intro": "Eurylepis petiolata, commonly known as the slender-leaved euphorbia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features simple, opposite, and often narrowly elliptic leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
