    "intro": "Echites velame, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered together, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
