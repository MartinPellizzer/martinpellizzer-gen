    "intro": "Ephedra aurantiaca, commonly known as the red ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and red, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Ephedra aurantiaca is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water. It is also known for containing ephedrine, a compound with historical medicinal uses."
