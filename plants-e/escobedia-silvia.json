    "intro": "Escobedia silvia, commonly known as Silvia's escoboid, is a rare and delicate lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-green thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form, adhering tightly to rock surfaces. The lichen lacks distinct medulla and has a thin, uniform cortex, which is a common feature in many foliose and crustose lichens. Escobedia silvia is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as forests or on the bark of trees. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
