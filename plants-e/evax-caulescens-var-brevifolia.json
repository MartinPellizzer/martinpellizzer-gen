It features small, narrow leaves that are densely arranged along its short, woody stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its foliage is evergreen, providing year-round interest in gardens. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
