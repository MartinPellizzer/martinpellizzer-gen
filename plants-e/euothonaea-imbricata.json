    "intro": "Euothonaea imbricata, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Euothonaea imbricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
