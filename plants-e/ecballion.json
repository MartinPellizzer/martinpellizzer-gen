    "intro": "Ecballion, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees that thrive in coastal and saline environments. They are characterized by their showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the fruits are capsule-like, containing numerous seeds. Ecballion species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their resilience and aesthetic appeal."
