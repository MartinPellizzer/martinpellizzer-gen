    "intro": "Epidendrum oliganthum, commonly known as the rare orchid of the Neotropical region, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
