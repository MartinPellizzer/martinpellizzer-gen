    "intro": "Eriopetalum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered eriopetalum, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh environment. Eriopetalum parviflorum is often found in open habitats such as dunes and coastal scrub."
