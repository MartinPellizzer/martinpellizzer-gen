    "intro": "Eucalyptus dura, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus dura is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its foliage and oils have been used in traditional medicine and for aromatic purposes."
