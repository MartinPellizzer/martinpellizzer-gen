    "intro": "Erigeron aphanactis, commonly known as the ghost fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves, adapted to withstand drought and heat."
