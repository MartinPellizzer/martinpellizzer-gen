    "intro": "Elytropappus glandulosus var. ambiguus, commonly known as the sticky goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies of xerophytic flora."
