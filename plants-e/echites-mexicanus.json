    "intro": "Echites mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican thornapple, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along disturbed areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
