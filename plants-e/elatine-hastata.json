    "intro": "Elatine hastata, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Elatine hastata is typically found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and ditches. Its presence indicates good water quality and is often used as an indicator species in ecological studies."
