    "intro": "Epipactis viridiflora subsp. pollinensis, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking greenish-yellow flowers with prominent, showy lips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds in capsule-like structures. The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated flowers and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of E. viridiflora."
