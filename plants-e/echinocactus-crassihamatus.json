    "intro": "Echinocactus crassihamatus, commonly known as the thick-shelled cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that are covered in thick, ribbed segments. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
