    "intro": "Encelia palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's bluebottle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Encelia palmeri is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in desert and semi-desert regions."
