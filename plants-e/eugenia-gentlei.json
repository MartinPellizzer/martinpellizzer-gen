    "intro": "Eugenia gentlei, commonly known as the Guanabana or Soursop, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a large, spiky fruit with a green, thick rind and a soft, white, pulpy interior. The fruit is rich in nutrients and has a unique, tropical flavor, though it contains toxic seeds. Botanically, it belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is valued for both its fruit and ornamental qualities."
