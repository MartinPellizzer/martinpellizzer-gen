    "intro": "Embryopteris kaki, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Embryopteris kaki plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
