    "intro": "Euryops glutinosus, commonly known as the sticky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers with purple centers, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Euryops glutinosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
