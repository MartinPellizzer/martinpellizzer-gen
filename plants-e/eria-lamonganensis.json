    "intro": "Eria lamonganensis, commonly known as the Lamongan orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
