    "intro": "Euphorbia maresii subsp. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Balearic Islands. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a distinctive cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
