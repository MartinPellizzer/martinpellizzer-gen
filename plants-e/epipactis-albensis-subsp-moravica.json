    "intro": "Epipactis albensis subsp. moravica, commonly known as the Moravian white helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose raceme. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows, often growing on decaying wood or in rich, loamy soil. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
