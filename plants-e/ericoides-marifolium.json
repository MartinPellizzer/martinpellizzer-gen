    "intro": "Ericoides marifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides marifolium thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
