    "intro": "Erlangea misera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom briefly during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Erlangea misera is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
