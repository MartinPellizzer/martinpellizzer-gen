    "intro": "Echinops persicus, commonly known as the Persian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Persia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are often mistaken for small cacti. The plant produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Echinops persicus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
