    "intro": "Eugenia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, thriving in saline and wind-exposed environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
