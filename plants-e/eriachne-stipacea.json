    "intro": "Eriachne stipacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and coastal dunes. Eriachne stipacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
