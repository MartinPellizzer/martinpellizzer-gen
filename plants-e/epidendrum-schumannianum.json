    "intro": "Epidendrum schumannianum, commonly known as the Schumann's epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with numerous flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients, while its leaves are typically dark green and strap-shaped. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
