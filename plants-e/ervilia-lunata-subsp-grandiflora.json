    "intro": "Ervilia lunata subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered moonflower, is a striking member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a velvety texture, and its stems are often hairy. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, kidney-shaped seeds."
