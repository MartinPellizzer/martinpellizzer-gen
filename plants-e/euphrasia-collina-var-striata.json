It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive white or pale green stripe running along their length, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, and is often found in sandy or loamy soils.
