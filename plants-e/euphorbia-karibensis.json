    "intro": "Euphorbia karibensis, commonly known as the Karibense spurge, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its spiny appearance and toxic sap, it is often used as a ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
