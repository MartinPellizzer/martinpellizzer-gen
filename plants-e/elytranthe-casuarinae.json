    "intro": "Elytranthe casuarinae, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. It blooms during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions, it is often used in coastal restoration projects."
