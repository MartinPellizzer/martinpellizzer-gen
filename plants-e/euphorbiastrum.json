It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the genus Euphorbia. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Euphorbiastrum plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
