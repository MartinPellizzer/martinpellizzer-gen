    "intro": "Eleocharis acutangula subsp. acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-pointed spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and adaptability to varying water conditions."
