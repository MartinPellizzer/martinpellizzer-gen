    "intro": "Eriogonum compositum subsp. lancifolium, commonly known as the lanceleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and plains. It produces small, three-lobed bracts that enclose its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is part of the Polygonaceae family and is well adapted to arid environments."
