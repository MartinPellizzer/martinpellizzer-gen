    "intro": "Evaiezoa ajugifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf ajuga, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features a low-growing rosette of silver-white, velvety leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of leafy stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and modest floral display."
