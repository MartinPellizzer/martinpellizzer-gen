    "intro": "Enochoria sylvicola, commonly known as the forest enoch, is a flowering plant native to the temperate woodlands of eastern North America. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers clustered in loose inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Enochoria sylvicola thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
