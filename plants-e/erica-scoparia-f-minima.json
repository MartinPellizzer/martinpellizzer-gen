    "intro": "Erica scoparia f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in mild climates."
