    "intro": "Echinocereus cirrhifer, commonly known as the hairless hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically sparsely covered with white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Echinocereus cirrhifer is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
