    "intro": "Echinopepon wrightii, commonly known as Wright's prickly squash, is a rare and unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, elongated fruit that resembles a squash but has a distinct, rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, a common trait in cucurbit plants. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
