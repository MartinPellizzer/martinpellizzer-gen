    "intro": "Erythraea roxburghii, commonly known as the red sanders, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a legume containing several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species."
