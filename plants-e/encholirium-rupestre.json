    "intro": "Encholirium rupestre, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Encholirium rupestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
