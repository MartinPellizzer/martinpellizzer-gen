    "intro": "Euphorbia richardsiae subsp. robusta, commonly known as the Richardsia euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
