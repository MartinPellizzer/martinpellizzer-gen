    "intro": "Eriogonum lachnogynum var. sarahiae, commonly known as Sarah's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is part of the Ericaceae family and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
