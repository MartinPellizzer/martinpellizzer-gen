    "intro": "Elymus baldschuanicus, commonly known as the Caucasian wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Elymus baldschuanicus is often found in steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
