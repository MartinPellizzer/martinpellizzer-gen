    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa subsp. procera, commonly known as the tall spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and sparsely branched stems covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Euphorbia pilosa subsp. procera is often cultivated for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
