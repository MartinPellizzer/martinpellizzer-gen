It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils, often in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
