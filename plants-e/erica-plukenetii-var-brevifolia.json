    "intro": "Erica plukenetii var. brevifolia, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blooms. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This hardy species is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
