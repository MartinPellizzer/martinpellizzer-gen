    "intro": "Euphorbia salota, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Euphorbia salota is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall."
