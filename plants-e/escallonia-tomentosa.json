    "intro": "Escallonia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly escallonia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, woolly grey foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Escallonia tomentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
