    "intro": "Euphorbia sclerophylla var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the Myrtleleaf Spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
