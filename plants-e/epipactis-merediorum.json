    "intro": "Epipactis merediorum, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, erect stem bearing the flower. Epipactis merediorum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species."
