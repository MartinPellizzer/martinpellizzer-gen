    "intro": "Epipactis viridans var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features a rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
