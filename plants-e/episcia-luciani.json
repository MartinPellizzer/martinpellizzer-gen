    "intro": "Episcia luciani, commonly known as the golden tinge episcia, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with a distinctive golden or yellowish tinge. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Episcia luciani is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
