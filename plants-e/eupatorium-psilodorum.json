    "intro": "Eupatorium psilodorum, commonly known as slender boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered with fine, hairy pubescence. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, with prominent veins and a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
