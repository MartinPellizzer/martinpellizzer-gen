    "intro": "Echinocactus pyramidalis, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its spiny, ribbed structure helps it retain water in harsh desert conditions. Echinocactus pyramidalis is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
