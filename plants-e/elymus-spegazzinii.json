    "intro": "Elymus spegazzinii, commonly known as the Spegazzini's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments. Elymus spegazzinii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in alpine and arid habitats."
