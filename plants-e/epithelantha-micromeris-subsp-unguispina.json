    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris subsp. unguispina, commonly known as the red-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a dense covering of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
