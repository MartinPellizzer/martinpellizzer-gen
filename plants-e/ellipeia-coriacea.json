    "intro": "Ellipeia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skinned lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, leathery texture due to its thick, rigid thallus. The plant exhibits a deep green to dark green coloration, with a slightly wrinkled surface. It is typically found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate forests. Ellipeia coriacea plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
