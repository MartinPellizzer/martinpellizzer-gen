    "intro": "Elemifera balsamifera, commonly known as the balsam fir, is a coniferous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that release a fragrant resin when crushed. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish in color, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its timber, essential oils, and ecological role in boreal forests."
