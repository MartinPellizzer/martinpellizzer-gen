It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to pineapples. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical structure reflects its role as a member of the palm family, with a distinct trunk and a crown of leaves."
