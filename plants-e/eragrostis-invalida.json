It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of tiny, spikelet-bearing branches. It is known for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
