    "intro": "Elettaria minor, commonly known as lesser cardamom, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is closely related to the more well-known cardamom species, Elettaria cardamomum. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by dark brown, aromatic seeds that are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable but lesser-known member of the ginger family."
