    "intro": "Eubrachion andalgalense, commonly known as the Andalusian brachion, is a rare aquatic plant native to southern Spain. It belongs to the family Characeae and is characterized by its filamentous structure and branching growth pattern. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. Its microscopic size and specialized cellular structures enable it to absorb nutrients efficiently from its surroundings. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
