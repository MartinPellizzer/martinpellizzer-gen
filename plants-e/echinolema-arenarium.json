    "intro": "Echinolema arenarium, commonly known as the sand dollar plant, is a unique species of algae that thrives in marine environments. It is characterized by its calcareous skeleton, which resembles the structure of a sand dollar, hence its common name. This organism is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to substrates like rocks or shells. The plant's structure consists of a central disc with radial spines, which provide support and aid in its survival in turbulent waters. Echinolema arenarium plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of sandy and rocky seabeds."
