    "intro": "Eucalyptus gregsoniana, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that is typically grey or brown in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
