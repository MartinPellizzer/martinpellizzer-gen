    "intro": "Eriosema argenteum, commonly known as silverleaf eriosema, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
