    "intro": "Eugenia melocactoides, commonly known as the Mexican rose or rose apple, is a small evergreen shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features smooth, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is noted for its ornamental value, particularly due to its showy, pinkish-red fruits that resemble small apples. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to gardens in tropical and subtropical climates. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
