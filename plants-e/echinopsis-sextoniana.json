    "intro": "Echinopsis sextoniana, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water requirements. Its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and botanical gardens."
