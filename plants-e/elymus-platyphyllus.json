    "intro": "Elymus platyphyllus, commonly known as the broadleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its flat, wide leaves and tufted inflorescence, which consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Elymus platyphyllus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and as a forage crop for livestock."
