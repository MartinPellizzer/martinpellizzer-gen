    "intro": "Elaphrium occidentale, commonly known as western elaphrium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
