    "intro": "Echinocactus molendensis, commonly known as the molendens spine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant produces large, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
