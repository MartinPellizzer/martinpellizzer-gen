    "intro": "Ephedra gerardiana var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock ephedra, is a dioecious shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is known for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of ephedrine. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with low precipitation. Due to its ecological and historical significance, it is also of interest in botanical and pharmacological research."
