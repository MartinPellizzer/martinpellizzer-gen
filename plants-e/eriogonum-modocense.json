    "intro": "Eriogonum modocense, commonly known as Modoc Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright red or orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Eriogonum modocense plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush-steppe ecosystems."
