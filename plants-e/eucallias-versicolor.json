    "intro": "Eucallias versicolor, commonly known as the variable eucallia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its variable flower color, ranging from white to pink and even purple. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Eucallias versicolor is often found in open woodlands and along rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
