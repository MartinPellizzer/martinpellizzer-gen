    "intro": "Echinocereus gurneyi, commonly known as the Gurney's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive spiny appearance, featuring dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration. Echinocereus gurneyi is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
