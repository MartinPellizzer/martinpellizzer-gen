    "intro": "Edraianthus graminifolius var. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf grass-like edraianthus, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or purple, which appear in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
