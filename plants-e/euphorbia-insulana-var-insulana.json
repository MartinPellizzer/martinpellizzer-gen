    "intro": "Euphorbia insulana var. insulana, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and distinctive, shield-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual contrast to its woody structure. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
