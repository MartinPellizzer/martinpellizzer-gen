    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a striking, showy inflorescence with greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. It has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its ability to hybridize with other epipactis species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
