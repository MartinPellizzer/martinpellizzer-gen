    "intro": "Ethulia rhizomata, commonly known as the moonroot plant, is a perennial herbaceous species characterized by its extensive underground rhizome system. The rhizomes are thick, fleshy, and often tuberous, serving as storage organs for nutrients and water. The plant typically features delicate, arrowhead-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its unique growth habit and medicinal properties, it is valued in traditional herbal practices."
