    "intro": "Epidendrum oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms during the spring and summer months, and its pseudobulbs are covered in a dense layer of white, velvety hair. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
