    "intro": "Elytraria maritima, commonly known as sea oats, is a coastal grass native to the southeastern United States. It has narrow, silver-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces fluffy, white seed heads that are carried by the wind, aiding in its dispersal. Its rhizomes form dense mats that stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Sea oats are an important component of dune ecosystems, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
