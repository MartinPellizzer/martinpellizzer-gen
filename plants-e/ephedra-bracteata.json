    "intro": "Ephedra bracteata, commonly known as the bractless ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and red-brown seed pods, which contain the seeds. Ephedra bracteata is part of the Ephedraceae family, which includes other species known for their medicinal properties. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
