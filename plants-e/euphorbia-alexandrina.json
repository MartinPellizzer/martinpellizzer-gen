    "intro": "Euphorbia alexandrina, commonly known as the Egyptian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It features succulent, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts. The plant is characterized by its milky latex sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with branching patterns and a unique flowering display that attracts pollinators."
