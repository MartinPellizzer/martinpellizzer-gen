    "intro": "Eriogonum wrightii var. membranaceum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its fibrous roots help it survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils."
