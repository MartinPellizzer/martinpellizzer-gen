    "intro": "Eupatorium palustre var. verbenaceum, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist or swampy areas, often near ponds or streams, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features tall, slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered white to pale blue flowers appear in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
