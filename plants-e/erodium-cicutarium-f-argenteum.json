    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium f. argenteum, commonly known as silver field bean, is a flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its silvery-white pubescence on the leaves and stems, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils. This annual herb is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
