    "intro": "Erica dura, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in spring and summer. Erica dura is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
