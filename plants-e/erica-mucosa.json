    "intro": "Erica mucosa, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a sticky substance, giving it its common name. Erica mucosa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
