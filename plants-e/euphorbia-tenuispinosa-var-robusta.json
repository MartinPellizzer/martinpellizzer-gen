    "intro": "Euphorbia tenuispinosa var. robusta, commonly known as the robust euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny tubercles that provide structural support and protection. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
