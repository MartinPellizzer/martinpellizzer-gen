    "intro": "Euphorbia collina var. patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian spurge, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
