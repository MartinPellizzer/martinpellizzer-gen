    "intro": "Euonymus longifolius, commonly known as the evergreen euonymus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cercidiphyllaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its dense, glossy evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split open to release seeds. Euonymus longifolius is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
