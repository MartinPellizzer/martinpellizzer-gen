    "intro": "Erucastrum varium subvar. mesatlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline, sandy habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The species is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it a hardy coastal plant."
