    "intro": "Escallonia jordanensis, commonly known as Jordan's escallonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Jordan and neighboring areas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, providing year-round visual interest. Escallonia jordanensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
