    "intro": "Exotheca chevalieri, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with a short, thick rhizome and fleshy, succulent stems. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which come in shades of purple, blue, and white, are borne on short, hairy pedicels and are adapted for pollination by birds and insects."
