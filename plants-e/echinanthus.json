    "intro": "Echinanthus, commonly known as the \"pincushion flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Echinanthus species are typically herbaceous annuals or perennials, characterized by their spiky, tubular flowers that resemble small pincushions. The flowers are usually pink, purple, or white, and they bloom in summer. The plant's name is derived from the Greek words \"echinos\" meaning hedgehog and \"anthos\" meaning flower, referring to the prickly appearance of its blooms."
