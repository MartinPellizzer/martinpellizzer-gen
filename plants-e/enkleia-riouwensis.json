    "intro": "Enkleia riouwensis, commonly known as the Riouwensis Enkleia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Sumba in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss, Enkleia riouwensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
