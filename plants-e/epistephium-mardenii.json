    "intro": "Epistephium mardenii, commonly known as the Marden's epistle plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows as an erect herb with lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
