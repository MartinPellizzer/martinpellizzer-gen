    "intro": "Eragrostis hirta, commonly known as hairy lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces dense spikes of small, pale green to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. Eragrostis hirta is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
