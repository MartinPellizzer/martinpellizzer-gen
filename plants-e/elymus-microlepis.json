    "intro": "Elymus microlepis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Elymus microlepis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun. Its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
