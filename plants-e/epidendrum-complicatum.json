    "intro": "Epidendrum complicatum, commonly known as the curly lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a pseudobulbous stem with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Epidendrum complicatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
