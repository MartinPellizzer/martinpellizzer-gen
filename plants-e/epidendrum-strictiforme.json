    "intro": "Epidendrum strictiforme, commonly known as the rigid form epiphyte, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Epidendrum strictiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
