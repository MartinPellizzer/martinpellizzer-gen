It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in groups called sori. Elaphoglossum imthurnii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitats."
