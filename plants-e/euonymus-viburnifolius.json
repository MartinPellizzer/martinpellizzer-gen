    "intro": "Euonymus viburnifolius, commonly known as the fragrant euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Euonymus viburnifolius is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
