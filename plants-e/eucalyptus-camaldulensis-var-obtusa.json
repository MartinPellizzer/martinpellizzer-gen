    "intro": "Eucalyptus camaldulensis var. obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a deciduous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a grey-green upper surface and a white underside. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in riverine areas and along watercourses. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green or yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds."
