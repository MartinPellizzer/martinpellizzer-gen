    "intro": "Ephedra fasciculata var. clokeyi, commonly known as Clokey's ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and the presence of branched stems covered in spines. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like structures. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert regions. This variety is notable for its medicinal properties, though its use is regulated due to the presence of ephedrine, a compound with potential health risks."
