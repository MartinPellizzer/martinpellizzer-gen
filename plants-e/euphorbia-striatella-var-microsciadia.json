It features small, cylindrical stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
