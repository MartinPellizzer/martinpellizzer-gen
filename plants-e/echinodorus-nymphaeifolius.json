    "intro": "Echinodorus nymphaeifolius, commonly known as the water lily sword, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, dark green, sword-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with some leaves submerged underwater. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, adding ornamental value to ponds and aquariums. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving water with moderate to high light exposure. Echinodorus nymphaeifolius is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
