    "intro": "Evolvulus genistoides, commonly known as the creeping blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that produces small, blue to violet flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed. The genus Evolvulus is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped seed pods that twist as they mature."
