It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy flower that is often pink or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, and the orchid has a complex root system adapted for nutrient absorption. Epipactis carinata is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
