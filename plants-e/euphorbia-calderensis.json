    "intro": "Euphorbia calderensis, commonly known as the Calder's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
