It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. Epidendrum faustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
