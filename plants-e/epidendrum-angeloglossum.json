    "intro": "Epidendrum angeloglossum, commonly known as the angel's tongue orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long, and often pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous showy, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. The flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
