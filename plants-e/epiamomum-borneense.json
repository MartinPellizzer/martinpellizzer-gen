    "intro": "Epiamomum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean epiamomum, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants like philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
