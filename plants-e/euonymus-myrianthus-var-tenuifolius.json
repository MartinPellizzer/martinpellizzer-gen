    "intro": "Euonymus myrianthus var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically narrow and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive orange-red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and persistent fruits."
