    "intro": "Eriogonum medium, commonly known as the stickybark buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems that become sticky when damaged, a feature that helps deter herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Eriogonum medium plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
