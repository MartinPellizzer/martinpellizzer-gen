    "intro": "Eleocharis complanata, commonly known as flat sedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Eleocharis complanata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
