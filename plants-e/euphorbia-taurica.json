    "intro": "Euphorbia taurica, commonly known as the Tauric spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is surrounded by modified leaves known as bracts. Euphorbia taurica is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or rocky environments. It contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling the plant."
