    "intro": "Epidendrum amethystinum, commonly known as the Amethyst Cascade Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet and purple inflorescences that cascade from its foliage, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Epidendrum amethystinum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
