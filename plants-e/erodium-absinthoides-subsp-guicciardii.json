It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in disturbed soils. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and it is often found in coastal regions."
