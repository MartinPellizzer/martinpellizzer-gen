    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. pseudovarium, commonly known as the variable field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, typical of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This fern-like plant is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
