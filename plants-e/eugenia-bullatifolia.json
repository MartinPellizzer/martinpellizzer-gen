    "intro": "Eugenia bullatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tip. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pinkish-red berries. Eugenia bullatifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. It is often found in dense undergrowth and is valued for its ornamental foliage and potential medicinal properties."
