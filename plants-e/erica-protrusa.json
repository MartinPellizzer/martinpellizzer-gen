    "intro": "Erica protrusa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica protrusa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
