    "intro": "Elaeocarpus heptadactyloides, commonly known as the seven-finger elaeocarp, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers. The plant's fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of the Elaeocarpaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
