    "intro": "Echinocactus setispinus f. orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's Hedgehog Cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the United States, specifically found in Texas. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a subtle bluish tint. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
