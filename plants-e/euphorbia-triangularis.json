It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped stems and waxy, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia triangularis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
