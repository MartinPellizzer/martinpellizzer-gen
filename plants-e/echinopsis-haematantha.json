    "intro": "Echinopsis haematantha, commonly known as the red echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its short, thick stems covered in spines and its striking red flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Its flowers are typically tubular and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters, making it a visually distinctive species. Echinopsis haematantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
