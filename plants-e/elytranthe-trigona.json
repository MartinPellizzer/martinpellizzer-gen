    "intro": "Elytranthe trigona, commonly known as the three-lobed rock cress, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three lobes, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Elytranthe trigona is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and resilience."
