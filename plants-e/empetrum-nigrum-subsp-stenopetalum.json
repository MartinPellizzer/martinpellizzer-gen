    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum subsp. stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, dark blue or black berries that are typically edible but often have a tart flavor. The plant has compact, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, mat-like structure, helping it to thrive in harsh, cold environments. It is often found in tundra and rocky habitats where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to extreme climates and limited growing conditions."
