It is a small shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and coastal dunes. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Encelia calva is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
