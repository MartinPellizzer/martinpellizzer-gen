    "intro": "Eremophila oppositifolia var. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive red or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora."
