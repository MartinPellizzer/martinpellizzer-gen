    "intro": "Eriosyce coimasensis, commonly known as the Coimasensis Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is a compact, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a pincushion appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Eriosyce coimasensis is appreciated for its unique morphology and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
