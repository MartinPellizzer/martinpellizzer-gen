    "intro": "Eriochrysis fusca, commonly known as the coastal starflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments. Eriochrysis fusca is often found in dunes and along the shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to the coastal landscape."
