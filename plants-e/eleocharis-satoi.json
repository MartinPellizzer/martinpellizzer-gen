    "intro": "Eleocharis satoi, commonly known as the Japanese spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical flower spikes. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist environments. Eleocharis satoi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
