    "intro": "Eritrichium aretioides, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Eritrichium aretioides is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations, where it contributes to the alpine flora diversity."
