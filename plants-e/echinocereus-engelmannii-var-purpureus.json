    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii var. purpureus, commonly known as the Purple Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in spines and often display a purple or reddish hue. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the areoles. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. This cactus is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in drought conditions."
