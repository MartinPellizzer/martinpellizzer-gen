    "intro": "Eritrichium rupestre subvar. spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems that produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The leaves are typically broad and spatulate, which gives the subspecies its name, and they are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a hardy garden plant."
