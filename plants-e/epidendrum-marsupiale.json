    "intro": "Epidendrum marsupiale, commonly known as the Marsupial Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers that are often violet or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum marsupiale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
