    "intro": "Epilobium roseum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is often distinguished from the typical form by its elongated leaves and slightly different floral structure."
