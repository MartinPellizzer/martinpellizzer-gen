    "intro": "Eriophorum \u00d7 medium var. rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, contributing to the ecological stability of wetland ecosystems. Its reddish-brown stems become more prominent as the plant matures, giving it its distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in association with other sedges and rushes, forming part of the vegetation structure in moist environments."
