It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, with a waxy, often colorful appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum macrobotryum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
