    "intro": "Euphorbia galiciana, commonly known as the Galician spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features a distinctive rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
