    "intro": "Ehrharta stricta, commonly known as silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Ehrharta stricta is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
