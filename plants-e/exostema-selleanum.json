    "intro": "Exostema selleanum, commonly known as the silverleaf sterculia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies. The plant is adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils."
