    "intro": "Eugenia millsii, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces dark purple, egg-shaped berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It has a dense, spreading growth habit and can become invasive in certain regions. Botanically, it belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove."
