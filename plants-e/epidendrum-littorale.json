    "intro": "Epidendrum littorale, commonly known as the coastal epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize open, disturbed areas. Epidendrum littorale is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
