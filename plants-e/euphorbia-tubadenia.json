    "intro": "Euphorbia tubadenia, commonly known as the tubadenia spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with a rough, bark-like texture, and its leaves are typically small and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny yellow flowers, which are surrounded by a characteristic greenish bract. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stem for survival. Euphorbia tubadenia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
