    "intro": "Epidendrum carvalhoi, commonly known as the Carvalho's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with vibrant orange and yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. It prefers well-draining substrates and consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value lies in its long-lasting, showy blooms that can last several months."
