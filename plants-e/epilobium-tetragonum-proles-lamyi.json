    "intro": "Epilobium tetragonum proles lamyi, commonly known as Lamy's four-angle willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wet meadows and riverbanks. The plant features quadrangular stems, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
