    "intro": "Excoecaria angustifolia, commonly known as the croton or Indian rubber plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red or yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate indoor conditions, it is a popular houseplant."
