    "intro": "Euphorbia guilielmi, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. Euphorbia guilielmi thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its sap contains latex, which can be irritant to the skin and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
