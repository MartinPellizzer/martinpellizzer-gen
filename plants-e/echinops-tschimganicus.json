It is characterized by its spiky, spherical flower heads that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant produces a large number of small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the development of hard, spiny seeds. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture and are arranged in a rosette at the base. Echinops tschimganicus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
