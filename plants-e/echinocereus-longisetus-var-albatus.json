    "intro": "Echinocereus longisetus var. albatus, commonly known as the white-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, featuring white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically 2\u20134 inches long and are pollinated by bats and insects. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
