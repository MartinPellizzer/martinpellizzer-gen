    "intro": "Euphorbia palustris var. brinonense, commonly known as the Brinon's marsh spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in damp environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in muddy or sandy soils along the edges of ponds, marshes, and ditches. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often found in areas with seasonal flooding or high groundwater levels."
