    "intro": "Ericoides vestifluum, commonly known as the velvetleaf heath, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Ericoides vestifluum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
