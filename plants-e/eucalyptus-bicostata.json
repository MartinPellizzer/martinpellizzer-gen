    "intro": "Eucalyptus bicostata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia, particularly in South Australia and Western Australia. The plant is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which appear during the autumn and winter seasons. Eucalyptus bicostata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often used in reforestation and land rehabilitation projects."
