    "intro": "Eucalyptus kochii subsp. amaryssia, commonly known as the red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown color beneath. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions."
