    "intro": "Euonymus japonicus f. rugosus, commonly known as Japanese spurge var. rugosus, is a variant of the Japanese spurge, characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured foliage. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that thrives in partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a waxy surface and a serrated margin. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
