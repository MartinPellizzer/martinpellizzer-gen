    "intro": "Esenbeckia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal esenbeckia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal environments, adapting to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Esenbeckia litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
