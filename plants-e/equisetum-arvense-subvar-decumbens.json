    "intro": "Equisetum arvense subvar. decumbens, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, spore-producing structures called strobila. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having whorls of small, scale-like structures called enations. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rapid growth makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed environments. Due to its high silica content, it is often referred to as \"milliner's grass\" because of its historical use in making hats."
