    "intro": "Eucalyptus froggattii, commonly known as the yellow box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that can range from pale yellow to cream-white. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and usually have a greyish-green upper surface. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
