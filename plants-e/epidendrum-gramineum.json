It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pendulous flower spikes that produce clusters of small, white or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Epidendrum gramineum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
