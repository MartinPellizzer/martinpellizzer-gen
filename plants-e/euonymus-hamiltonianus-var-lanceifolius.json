    "intro": "Euonymus hamiltonianus var. lanceifolius, commonly known as the lanceleaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use. It thrives in partial to full shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
