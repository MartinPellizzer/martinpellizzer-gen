    "intro": "Euphorbia robivelonae, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
