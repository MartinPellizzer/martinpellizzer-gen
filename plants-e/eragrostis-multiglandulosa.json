    "intro": "Eragrostis multiglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent glandular structures along the leaf sheaths. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Eragrostis multiglandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
