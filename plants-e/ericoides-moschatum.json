    "intro": "Ericoides moschatum, commonly known as the sweet-scented erica, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family, Ericaceae. It is native to South Africa, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils typical of fynbos vegetation. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, and it is notable for its fragrant, often honey-scented blooms. Ericoides moschatum is typically evergreen, with leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, ornamental plants."
