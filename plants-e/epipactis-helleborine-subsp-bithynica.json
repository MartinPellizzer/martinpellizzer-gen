    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a complex reproductive system involving mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Its morphology and habitat preferences reflect its adaptation to temperate forest ecosystems."
