    "intro": "Erigeron caespitosus var. nauseosus, commonly known as the stinkweed fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The species is noted for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which may deter herbivores and contribute to its survival in competitive environments."
