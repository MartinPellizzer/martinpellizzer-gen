It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces long, pendant inflorescences. Epidendrum thrixspermum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
