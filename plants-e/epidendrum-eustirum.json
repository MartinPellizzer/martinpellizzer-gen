    "intro": "Epidendrum eustirum, commonly known as the violet-tinged epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet and green variegated leaves, which often have a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically arranged in a spike. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum eustirum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
