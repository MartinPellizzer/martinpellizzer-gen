    "intro": "Eucalyptus varia subsp. salsuginosa, commonly known as the coastal mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often in areas with high salinity and strong winds. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal vegetation."
