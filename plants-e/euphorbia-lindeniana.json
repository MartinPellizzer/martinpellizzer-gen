    "intro": "Euphorbia lindeniana, commonly known as the Lindena's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with its swollen, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a unique structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia lindeniana is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
