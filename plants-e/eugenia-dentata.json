    "intro": "Eugenia dentata, commonly known as the serrated eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several small, dark seeds. Eugenia dentata is often found in coastal regions and sandy soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
