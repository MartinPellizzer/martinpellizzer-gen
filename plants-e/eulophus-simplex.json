    "intro": "Eulophus simplex, commonly known as the simple eulophus, is a small, annual plant belonging to the family Eulophidae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with slender stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their size and lack of showy features. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in grassy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
