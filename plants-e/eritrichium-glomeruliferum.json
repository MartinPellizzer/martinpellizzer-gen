    "intro": "Eritrichium glomeruliferum, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Eritrichium glomeruliferum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
