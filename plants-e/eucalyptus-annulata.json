    "intro": "Eucalyptus annulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallet tree, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive blue-green color with a prominent midrib. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
