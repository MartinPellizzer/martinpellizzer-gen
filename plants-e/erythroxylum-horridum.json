    "intro": "Erythroxylum horridum, commonly known as the Peruvian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stem and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into oval, berry-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The leaves and stems contain alkaloids, including cathinone, which have been used traditionally for their stimulant properties. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
