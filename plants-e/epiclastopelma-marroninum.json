    "intro": "Epiclastopelma marroninum, commonly known as the Marronine Sword Fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests or rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
