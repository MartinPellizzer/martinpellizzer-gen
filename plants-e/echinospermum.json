    "intro": "Echinospermum, commonly known as the spiny seed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive spiny or prickly seed heads, which are adaptations for seed dispersal by wind or animals. The leaves are typically alternate, hairy, and often have a rough texture. Echinospermum species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, South America, and Australia. They are often used in traditional medicine and have ecological importance in their native habitats."
