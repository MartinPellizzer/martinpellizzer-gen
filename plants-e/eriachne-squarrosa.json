    "intro": "Eriachne squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, pale flowers. Eriachne squarrosa is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
