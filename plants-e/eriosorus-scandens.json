    "intro": "Eriosorus scandens, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The leaves and flowers are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its characteristic soft texture."
