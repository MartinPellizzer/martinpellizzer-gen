    "intro": "Eltroplectris, commonly known as the club-moss or spikemoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are typically small, evergreen, and have a distinctive appearance with upright, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. Eltroplectris species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, and their life cycle includes a dominant sporophyte stage. Some species of Eltroplectris are used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value and ecological importance."
