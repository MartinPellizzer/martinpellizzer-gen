    "intro": "Eupatorium laevigatum var. arenarium, commonly known as the sand eupatorium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy soils in the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white to pinkish flowers in late summer, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal and sandy landscapes."
