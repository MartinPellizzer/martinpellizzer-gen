    "intro": "Eucalyptus bicolor var. parviflora, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of central Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, with a prominent midrib. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters, typically during the winter months. This species is well adapted to drought and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
