    "intro": "Embamma caudigerum, commonly known as the hairy-tailed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The hairy-tailed fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
