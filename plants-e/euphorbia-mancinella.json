    "intro": "Euphorbia mancinella, commonly known as the sweet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem. Like many euphorbias, it produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin."
