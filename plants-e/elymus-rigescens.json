    "intro": "Elymus rigescens, commonly known as stiff wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as prairies, roadsides, and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets. Elymus rigescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
