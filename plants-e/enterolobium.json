    "intro": "Enterolobium, commonly known as the \"bottle tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, bottle-shaped trunks and are native to tropical regions of the Americas. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they have small leaflets arranged in pairs along the stems. Enterolobium species produce long, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, often used in traditional cuisines. Additionally, the plant is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural purposes."
