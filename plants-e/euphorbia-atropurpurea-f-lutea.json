    "intro": "Euphorbia atropurpurea f. lutea, commonly known as the orange sunset euphorbia, is a compact, ornamental plant characterized by its striking, fleshy, spiny stems and vibrant foliage. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
