    "intro": "Electranthera mutica var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
