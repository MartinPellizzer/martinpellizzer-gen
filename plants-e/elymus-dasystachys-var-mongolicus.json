    "intro": "Elymus dasystachys var. mongolicus, commonly known as the Mongolian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, awned florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppe and desert regions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
