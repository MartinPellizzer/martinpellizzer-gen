    "intro": "Euphrasia verna, commonly known as the spring gentian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive blue or purple throat. It blooms early in the spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies. Euphrasia verna is also an important plant for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
