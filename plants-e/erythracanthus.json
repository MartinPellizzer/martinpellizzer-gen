    "intro": "Erythracanthus, commonly known as the red-armed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive, elongated lip. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Erythracanthus species typically grow in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. The plants have sympodial growth habits, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Their flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly bees and flies, which are attracted by their vivid colors and fragrances."
