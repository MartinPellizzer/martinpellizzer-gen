    "intro": "Echinocactus rectispinus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem and the presence of spines that are typically yellow or red. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative plant."
