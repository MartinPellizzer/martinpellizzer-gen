It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant is distinguished by its soft, silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, daisy-like flowers that are usually pale yellow to white in color. Eremohylema sericea is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate to conserve water."
