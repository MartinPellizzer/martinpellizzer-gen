    "intro": "Eucalyptus rugosa, commonly known as rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a rough texture. The plant produces creamy-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus rugosa is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
