    "intro": "Elionurus barbiculmis, commonly known as the barbed hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive barbed hairs on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and wetland habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers. Elionurus barbiculmis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
