    "intro": "Erodium cadmaeum, commonly known as common stork's bill, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a small annual herb that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender stems and opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive elliptical seed pods that resemble a stork's bill, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Erodium cadmaeum is known for its ability to spread rapidly and is considered a weed in some regions."
