    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. irriguum, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that thrives in moist or aquatic environments. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems that are often green or yellow-green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found near the water's surface. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. This fern-like plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
