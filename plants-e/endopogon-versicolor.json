It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a mix of yellow and white petals, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Endopogon versicolor is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
