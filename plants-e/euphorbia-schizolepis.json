    "intro": "Euphorbia schizolepis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems and leaves. Euphorbia schizolepis is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine."
