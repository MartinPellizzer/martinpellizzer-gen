    "intro": "Echinops glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky globemallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are covered in glandular hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by the development of its distinctive, sticky seed capsules. Echinops glandulosus thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it a notable species in arid ecosystems."
