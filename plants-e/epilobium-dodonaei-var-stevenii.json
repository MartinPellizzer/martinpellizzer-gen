It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Native to the western United States, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as streambanks and meadows.
