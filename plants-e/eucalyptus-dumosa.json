    "intro": "Eucalyptus dumosa, commonly known as the woolly eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly grey or white foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hair. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. The bark is usually smooth and peels off in strips, revealing a mottled pattern beneath."
