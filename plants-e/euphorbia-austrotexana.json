    "intro": "Euphorbia austrotexana, commonly known as the Texas spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, showcasing its adaptability to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia austrotexana is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
