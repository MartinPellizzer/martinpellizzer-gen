    "intro": "Ericoides meuronii, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic conditions. Ericoides meuronii is often found in rocky or sandy habitats along the coastline."
