    "intro": "Euphorbia megistopoda, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, requiring caution when handling."
