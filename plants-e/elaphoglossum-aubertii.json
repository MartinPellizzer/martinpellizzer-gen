    "intro": "Elaphoglossum aubertii, commonly known as the Aubert's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns.
