    "intro": "Euphorbia biconvexa, commonly known as the two-lobed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
