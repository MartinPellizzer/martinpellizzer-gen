    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. robustum, commonly known as the rough horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, abrasive silica deposits. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other areas with consistently damp soil. Due to its high silica content, it is often used in traditional herbal remedies and as a natural abrasive."
