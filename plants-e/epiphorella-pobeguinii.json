    "intro": "Epiphorella pobeguinii, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and exquisite member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers with a star-like appearance, which bloom during the warmer months. Epiphorella pobeguinii is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
