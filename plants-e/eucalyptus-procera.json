    "intro": "Eucalyptus procera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallet tree, is a tall, slender eucalyptus species native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The tree produces small, globular flower spikes that are usually pale green or cream in color. Its flowers are followed by woody capsules that contain aromatic, oval-shaped seeds. Eucalyptus procera is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
