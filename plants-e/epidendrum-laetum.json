    "intro": "Epidendrum laetum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous plant with long, strap-like leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, showy lips. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum laetum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardeners."
