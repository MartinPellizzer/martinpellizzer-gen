    "intro": "Eupatorium clematideum var. gracillimum, commonly known as the slender blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
