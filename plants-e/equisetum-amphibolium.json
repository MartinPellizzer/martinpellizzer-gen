    "intro": "Equisetum amphibolium, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores. Equisetum amphibolium is often found in wetland habitats and is an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
