    "intro": "Euphorbia glebulosa subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
