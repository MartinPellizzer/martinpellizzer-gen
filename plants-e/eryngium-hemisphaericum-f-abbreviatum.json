    "intro": "Eryngium hemisphaericum f. abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf thistle or Mexican thistle, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Mexico. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are narrow and slightly lobed. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence, which gives it its species name \"hemisphaericum.\" Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, though it prefers well-drained soil."
