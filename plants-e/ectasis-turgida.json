    "intro": "Ectasis turgida, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are modified into bladder-like sacs, which are used to capture prey through a rapid closing mechanism. These bladders are typically green or reddish in color and can inflate to several times their original size. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, where it can efficiently capture and digest its prey."
