It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale to brownish flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. This variety is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
