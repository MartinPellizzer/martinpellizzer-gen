    "intro": "Elatostema pilosum, commonly known as the silky elatostema, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Elatostema pilosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common sight in humid, tropical ecosystems."
