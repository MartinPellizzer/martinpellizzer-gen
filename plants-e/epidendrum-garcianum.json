    "intro": "Epidendrum garcianum, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the previous ones. The plant typically features lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in two rows, providing structural support for its inflorescence. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with a distinctive purple or brown lip, and they bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Epidendrum garcianum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
