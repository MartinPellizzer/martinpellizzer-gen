It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are typically white or cream and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits."
