    "intro": "Endiandra sankeyana, commonly known as the Sankey's endiandra, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody structure and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
