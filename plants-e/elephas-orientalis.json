    "intro": "Elephas orientalis, commonly known as the oriental elephant, is a large herbivorous mammal native to the forests and grasslands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive body, long trunk, and large ears, which aid in thermoregulation. The plant refers to the elephant's habitat, which includes a variety of vegetation such as grasses, shrubs, and trees. Elephas orientalis plays a crucial role in shaping its ecosystem through seed dispersal and vegetation modification. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species from habitat loss and poaching."
