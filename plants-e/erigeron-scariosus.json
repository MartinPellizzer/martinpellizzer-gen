    "intro": "Erigeron scariosus, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow to white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Erigeron scariosus is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
