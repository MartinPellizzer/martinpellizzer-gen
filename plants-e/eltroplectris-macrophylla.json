    "intro": "Eltroplectris macrophylla, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking orchid species native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, with vivid pink and white petals. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in areas with high humidity and abundant sunlight. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often forming dense clusters that help it anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Eltroplectris macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
