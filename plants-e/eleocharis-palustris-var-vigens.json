    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris var. vigens, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dark brown, cylindrical spikelets. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
