    "intro": "Eryngium aquaticum var. aquaticum, commonly known as water thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of silver-gray, spiny leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, spiky flower heads that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
