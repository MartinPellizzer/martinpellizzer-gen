    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cinctum, commonly known as the banded harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green with a metallic sheen and often have a prominent midrib. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Elaphoglossum cinctum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
