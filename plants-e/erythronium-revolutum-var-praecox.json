    "intro": "Erythronium revolutum var. praecox, commonly known as the early yellow trillium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with three petals and three sepals. The plant has a short, rhizomatous rootstock and produces a single stem that bears the floral display. Its foliage consists of three broad, heart-shaped leaves that emerge from the base. This variety is noted for its early blooming habit, often flowering in late spring before the more common E. revolutum."
