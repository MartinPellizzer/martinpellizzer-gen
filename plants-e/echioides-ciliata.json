    "intro": "Echioides ciliata, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Echioides ciliata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
