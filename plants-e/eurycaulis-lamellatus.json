It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Eurycaulis lamellatus is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a challenging weed to control."
