    "intro": "Euphorbia macrorhiza, commonly known as swamp spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to 1 meter tall, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant has alternate, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and have a waxy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
