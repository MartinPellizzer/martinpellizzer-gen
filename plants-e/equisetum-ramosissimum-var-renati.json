    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. renati, commonly known as the Renati's horse tail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a central, unbranched stem. This variety is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its structure resembles that of ancient plants from the Carboniferous period. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in wetland environments."
