    "intro": "Eucalyptus pumila, commonly known as the woolly leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. Eucalyptus pumila is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging climates."
