It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of an oak. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often exuding a sticky sap when damaged. Erinosma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
