    "intro": "Eleocharis alpina, commonly known as alpine spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis alpina is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
