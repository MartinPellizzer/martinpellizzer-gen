    "intro": "Euphorbia schillingii var. praecox, commonly known as the early Schilling's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures containing the true flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
