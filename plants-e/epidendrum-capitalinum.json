    "intro": "Epidendrum capitalinum, commonly known as the Royal Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or purple lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. Epidendrum capitalinum is prized by orchid growers for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
