    "intro": "Exostema veraensis, commonly known as the Vera's exostem, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with thick, fibrous bark and a root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
