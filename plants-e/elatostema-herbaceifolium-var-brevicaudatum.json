    "intro": "Elatostema herbaceifolium var. brevicaudatum, commonly known as the short-tailed elatostema, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, often arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions."
