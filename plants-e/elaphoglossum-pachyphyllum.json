    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its densely packed, dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Elaphoglossum pachyphyllum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
