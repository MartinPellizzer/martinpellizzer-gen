    "intro": "Eritrichium limonium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant grows from a compact rosette of leaves and produces daisy-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single cluster at the top of the stem, and it is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Eritrichium limonium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
