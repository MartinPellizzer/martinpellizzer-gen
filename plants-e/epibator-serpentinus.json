    "intro": "Epibator serpentinus, commonly known as the serpentine epibator, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils found on serpentine rock formations. It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant is adapted to tolerate heavy metals and low fertility conditions, which are typical of its unique habitat. Its flowers are typically small and white or greenish, arranged in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
