    "intro": "Elymus repens var. dumetorum, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray sheaths and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, ditches, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense, mat-like colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
