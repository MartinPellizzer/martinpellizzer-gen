It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
