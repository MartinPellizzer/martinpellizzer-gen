    "intro": "Eucalyptus maidenii var. williamsonii, commonly known as the Mitchell's gum, is a variant of the broad-leafed eucalyptus species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The flowers are typically creamy white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This variety is known for its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds used in traditional medicine and modern pharmaceuticals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions."
