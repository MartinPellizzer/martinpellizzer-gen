    "intro": "Euphorbia buxifolia var. flexuosa, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, rounded foliage that is covered in a fine, white powdery coating, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by orange-red seed capsules. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
