    "intro": "Eriocaulon elatum, commonly known as the tall spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Eriocaulon elatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
