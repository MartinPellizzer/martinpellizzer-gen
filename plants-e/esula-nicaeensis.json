    "intro": "Esula nicaeensis, commonly known as the Nicaean esula, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Esula nicaeensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
