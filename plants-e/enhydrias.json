    "intro": "Enhydrias, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has vibrant purple flowers and long, narrow leaves that allow it to float on the surface of water. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats covering water bodies. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, which can affect water quality. Enhydrias is often considered an invasive species in many parts of the world."
