    "intro": "Epidendrum raniferum var. luteum, commonly known as the Yellow Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fleshy leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions. It prefers bright, indirect light and consistent moisture in well-draining potting mix."
