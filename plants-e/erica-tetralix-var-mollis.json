    "intro": "Erica tetralix var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of Scotland and parts of Ireland. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or magenta, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are softer and more rounded compared to other heath species, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and moorlands. Erica tetralix var. mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
