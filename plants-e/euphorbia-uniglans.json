    "intro": "Euphorbia uniglans, commonly known as the single-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, thick, fleshy leaf that emerges from a short, woody stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, waxy leaves help it retain water, adapting it to arid environments. Euphorbia uniglans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
