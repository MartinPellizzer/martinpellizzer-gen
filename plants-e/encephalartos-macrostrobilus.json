It is characterized by its large, robust leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
