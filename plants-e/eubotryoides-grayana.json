    "intro": "Eubotryoides grayana, commonly known as the Gray's eubotryoides, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eubotryoides grayana is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
