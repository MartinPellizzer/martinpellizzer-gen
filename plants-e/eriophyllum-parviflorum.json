    "intro": "Eriophyllum parviflorum, commonly known as the narrowflower goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriophyllum parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
