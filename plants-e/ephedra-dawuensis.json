    "intro": "Ephedra dawuensis, commonly known as the Yunnan ephedra, is a shrub native to China, particularly found in the Yunnan Province. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It contains ephedrine, a compound with historical use in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is also considered a controlled substance in many regions."
