    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 pallidum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Epilobium \u00d7 pallidum is known for its hardiness and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
