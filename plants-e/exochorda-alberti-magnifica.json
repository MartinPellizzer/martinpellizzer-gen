    "intro": "Exochorda alberti magnifica, commonly known as the Alberti magnifica honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern China. It features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in clusters of white to pinkish-white petals. The plant has arching branches with small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from both its floral display and its autumn foliage."
