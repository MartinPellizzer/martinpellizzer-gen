It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and oval-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
