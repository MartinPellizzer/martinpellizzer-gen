    "intro": "Erigeron involucratus, commonly known as the narrowleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and prairies, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. The showy white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
