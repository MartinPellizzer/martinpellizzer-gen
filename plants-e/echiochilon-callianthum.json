    "intro": "Echiochilon callianthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate rainfall. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
