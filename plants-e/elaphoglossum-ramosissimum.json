    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ramosissimum, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum ramosissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
