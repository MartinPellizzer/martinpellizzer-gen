    "intro": "Eucalyptus oleosa subsp. wylieana, commonly known as the Wylie's malleable gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled grey and white appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a slightly hairy underside. It produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in coastal and sandy areas."
