    "intro": "Epipactis lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Epipactis lehmanniana is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them."
