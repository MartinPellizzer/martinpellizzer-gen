    "intro": "Euphorbia pinus, commonly known as the pine spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a thick, fleshy structure that helps it store water, adapting to arid environments. Its leaves are typically scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Euphorbia pinus is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun."
