    "intro": "Eugenia persicifolia, commonly known as the rose apple or Java apple, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pinkish-red fruits resembling small apples. The fruit contains a single seed and is often used in culinary applications due to its sweet and tart flavor. Eugenia persicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
