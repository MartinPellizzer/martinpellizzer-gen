    "intro": "Echium vulgare, commonly known as common evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting various pollinators such as moths and beetles. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Echium vulgare thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
