    "intro": "Epilobium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated willow herb, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as along stream banks and in woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have finely serrated margins. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and are usually pink to reddish in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Epilobium serrulatum is often found in disturbed or wet habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
