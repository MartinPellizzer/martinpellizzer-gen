    "intro": "Eriachne nodosa, commonly known as the nodular grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Australia and is typically found in sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Eriachne nodosa is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
