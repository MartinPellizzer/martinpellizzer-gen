    "intro": "Embothrium linearifolium, commonly known as the Chilean firetree, is a deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of southern Chile and southern Argentina. It features slender, often twisted stems and is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate temperatures and salt spray. Embothrium linearifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
