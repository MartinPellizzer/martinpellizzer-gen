It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
