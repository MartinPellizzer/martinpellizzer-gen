    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum f. capillare, commonly known as the slender wood horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are typically less than 30 cm in height. The plant features whorled leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing strobila, which are cone-like formations at the apex of the stems."
