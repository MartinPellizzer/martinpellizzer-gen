    "intro": "Ehrharta rupestris, commonly known as the rocksettu grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to blue flowers. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
