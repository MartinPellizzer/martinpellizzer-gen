    "intro": "Epilobium cylindrostigma, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in spikes at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Epilobium cylindrostigma is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
