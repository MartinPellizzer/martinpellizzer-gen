    "intro": "Euphorbia collina var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sand spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by greenish, waxy seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
