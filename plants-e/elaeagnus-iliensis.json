    "intro": "Elaeagnus iliensis, commonly known as the Ili silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and at high altitudes. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Elaeagnus iliensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and potential ecological benefits in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
