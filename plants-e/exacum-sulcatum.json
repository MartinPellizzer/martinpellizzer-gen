    "intro": "Exacum sulcatum, commonly known as the zigzag flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant has a trailing growth habit and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its compact size. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the stems are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Exacum sulcatum thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
