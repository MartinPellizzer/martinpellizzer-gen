    "intro": "Encyclia glauca, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a pleasant fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Encyclia glauca is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
