    "intro": "Euphorbia braunsii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Euphorbia braunsii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
