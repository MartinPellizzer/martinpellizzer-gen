    "intro": "Euphorbia abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian spurge, is a succulent plant native to Ethiopia. It features a short, thick stem with numerous branches that form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-shaped inflorescence called a cyathium. Its leaves are alternate, fleshy, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia abyssinica is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
