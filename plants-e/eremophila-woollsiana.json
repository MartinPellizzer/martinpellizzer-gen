    "intro": "Eremophila woollsiana, commonly known as the Woolly Emu Bush, is a shrub native to Australia, particularly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and low rainfall environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators. Eremophila woollsiana is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in drought-prone gardens."
