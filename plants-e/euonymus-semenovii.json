    "intro": "Euonymus semenovii, commonly known as the Semenov's spurge-ash, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which consists of oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. Euonymus semenovii is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
