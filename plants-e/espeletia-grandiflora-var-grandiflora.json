    "intro": "Espeletia grandiflora var. grandiflora, commonly known as the \"Puya raimondii\" or the \"Queen of the Andes,\" is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of large, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces an impressive inflorescence of numerous small, showy flowers that bloom in a striking display of red, yellow, and orange. It is adapted to the harsh, cold, and dry conditions of the Andean highlands. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a symbol of the Andean flora and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,000 meters."
