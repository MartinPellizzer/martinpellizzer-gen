    "intro": "Epithema brunonis var. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-leafed epithema, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, deep violet foliage that provides a dramatic visual contrast against its pale green stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale purple, adding to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its unique coloration and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
