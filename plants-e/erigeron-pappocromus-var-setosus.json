    "intro": "Erigeron pappocromus var. setosus, commonly known as the hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and fluffy, white to pale purple flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower structure. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations that help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
