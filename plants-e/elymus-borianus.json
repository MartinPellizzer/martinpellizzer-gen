    "intro": "Elymus borianus, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are often adorned with bristles, giving it a distinctive appearance. Elymus borianus is well adapted to cold and arid environments, thriving in rocky and alpine habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
