It is characterized by its erect or semi-woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Epilobium \u00d7 martrinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
