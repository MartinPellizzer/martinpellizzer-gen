    "intro": "Eriophorum opacum var. cinnamomeum, commonly known as cinnamon tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and bog habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown to reddish-brown tufts of hair-like shoots, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in clusters, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, forming in spike-like clusters at the tips of the shoots. This variety is adapted to nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
