    "intro": "Erythraea stricta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. Erythraea stricta is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its bark and wood have been traditionally used for various purposes, including construction and medicinal applications."
