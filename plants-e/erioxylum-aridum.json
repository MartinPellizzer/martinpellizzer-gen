    "intro": "Erioxylum aridum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Erioxylum aridum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
