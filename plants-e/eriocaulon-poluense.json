    "intro": "Eriocaulon poluense, commonly known as the Poluense spike-moss, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Eriocaulon poluense plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
