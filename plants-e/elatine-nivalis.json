    "intro": "Elatine nivalis, commonly known as the snow bladder, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in temperate regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branched stems that produce small, floating or submerged leaves. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Elatine nivalis is known for its ability to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor waters and is often an indicator of clean, unpolluted water."
