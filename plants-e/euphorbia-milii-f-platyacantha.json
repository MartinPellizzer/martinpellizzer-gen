    "intro": "Euphorbia milii f. platyacantha, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its resilience and ability to thrive in low-water conditions. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, requiring caution when handling."
