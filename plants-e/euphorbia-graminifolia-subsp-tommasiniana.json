    "intro": "Euphorbia graminifolia subsp. tommasiniana, commonly known as the Italian spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
