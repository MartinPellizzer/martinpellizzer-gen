    "intro": "Eriogonum cernuum var. psammophilum, commonly known as the sand dune buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant adapted to arid and sandy environments. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. This species plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
