    "intro": "Elvasia macrostipularis, commonly known as the large-stipitate elvasia, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique morphological features. It is a herbaceous plant with elongated, lanceolate leaves that have prominent stipules, giving it its common name. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically displaying a range of colors from white to pink. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments with rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
