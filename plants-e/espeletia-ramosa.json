    "intro": "Espeletia ramosa, commonly known as the \"Puya ramosa,\" is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky rosette of leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences that are often pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Espeletia ramosa is also known for its ability to survive in harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking member of its ecosystem."
