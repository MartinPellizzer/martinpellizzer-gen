    "intro": "Euphorbia sibthorpii, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it. Euphorbia sibthorpii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
