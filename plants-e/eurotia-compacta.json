    "intro": "Eurotia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
