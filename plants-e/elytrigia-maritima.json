    "intro": "Elytrigia maritima, commonly known as sea wheat, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal vegetation. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes helps prevent erosion in maritime environments."
