The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are generally alternate and ovate, with a rough texture. Euphorbia neocapitata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit, which has a tangy, sweet flavor."
