    "intro": "Euonymus fortunei var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing shrub native to East Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a slightly waxy texture, and its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It is often used as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
