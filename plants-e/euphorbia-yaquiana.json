It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant features succulent stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in its native habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.
