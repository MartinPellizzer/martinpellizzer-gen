    "intro": "Echidnopsis, commonly known as the honeycomb cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is characterized by its unique, segmented stems that often resemble a honeycomb due to the presence of raised, rib-like structures. The plant is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Echidnopsis species typically produce small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. These cacti are prized for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in succulent gardens."
