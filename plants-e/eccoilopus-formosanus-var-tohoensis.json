    "intro": "Eccoilopus formosanus var. tohoensis, commonly known as the Taiwan mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid forest environments at high elevations. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and a complex system of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
