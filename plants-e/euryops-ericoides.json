    "intro": "Euryops ericoides, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow daisy-like flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas along the shoreline. Euryops ericoides is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dune systems."
