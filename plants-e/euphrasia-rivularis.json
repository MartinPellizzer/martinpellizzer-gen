    "intro": "Euphrasia rivularis, commonly known as the water eyebright, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. The plant features small, yellowish-orange flowers with prominent yellow markings, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Euphrasia rivularis is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in the damp, nutrient-rich soil."
