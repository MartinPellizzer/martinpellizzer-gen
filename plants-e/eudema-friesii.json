It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eudema friesii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
