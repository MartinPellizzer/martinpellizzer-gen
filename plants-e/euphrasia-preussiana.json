It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a creeping rootstock that helps it spread. Euphrasia preussiana is known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to support eye health and treat various inflammatory conditions."
