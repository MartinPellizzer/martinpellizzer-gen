    "intro": "Eugenia cymatodes, commonly known as the rough-leaved guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its rough, elliptical leaves with a pubescent surface. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered in cymes, followed by small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. The fruits are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other guava species. It is often grown for its ornamental value and as a source of medicinal compounds."
