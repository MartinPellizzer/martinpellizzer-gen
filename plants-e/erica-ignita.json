    "intro": "Erica ignita, commonly known as the Cape heath or fire heath, is a flowering plant native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica ignita is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
