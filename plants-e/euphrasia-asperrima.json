    "intro": "Euphrasia asperrima, commonly known as the rough eyebright, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which contribute to its common name. Euphrasia asperrima is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
