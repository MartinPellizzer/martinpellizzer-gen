    "intro": "Euphorbia mucronata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Euphorbia mucronata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
