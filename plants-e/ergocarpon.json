    "intro": "Ergocarpon, commonly known as the \"ergot fungus,\" is a type of fungal plant pathogen that belongs to the genus Claviceps. It primarily infects grasses, particularly rye, and produces a range of alkaloids, including ergotamine and ergocryptine. The fungus forms dark, sclerotial bodies called ergots within the flower spikes of infected plants. These ergots can be toxic to animals and humans if ingested, leading to a condition known as ergotism. Ergocarpon's life cycle involves the production of spores that are dispersed by wind, enabling the fungus to spread to new host plants."
