    "intro": "Englerophoenix maripa, commonly known as the Maripa date palm, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, date-like fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils near the shoreline. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
