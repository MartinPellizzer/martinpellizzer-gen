    "intro": "Endosamara racemosa var. pallida, commonly known as the pale raceme samara, is a member of the Rutaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive samaras\u2014winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemate inflorescences, giving the plant its specific epithet. The pale varietal form is distinguished by its reduced pigmentation and delicate foliage."
