    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. agreste, commonly known as field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, tooth-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This plant is typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its structure resembles that of ancient plants from the Carboniferous period. The plant has no true leaves or roots, and its stems are segmented with nodes and internodes."
