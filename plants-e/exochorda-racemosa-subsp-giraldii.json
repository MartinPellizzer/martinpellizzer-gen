    "intro": "Exochorda racemosa subsp. giraldii, commonly known as the pink-flowered snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its branching structure is typically open and somewhat weedy, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive floral display."
