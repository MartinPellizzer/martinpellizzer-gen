    "intro": "Euphorbia arvalis subsp. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled spurge, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a rosette of thick, waxy, and often blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish inflorescences called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are usually erect and can grow up to 30 cm in height. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated styles in the flowers, giving it its specific epithet \"longistyla.\""
