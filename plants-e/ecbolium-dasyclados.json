    "intro": "Ecbolium dasyclados, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Ecbolium dasyclados is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the consumption of prey for nutrient acquisition."
