    "intro": "Euphorbia lutosa, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia lutosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
