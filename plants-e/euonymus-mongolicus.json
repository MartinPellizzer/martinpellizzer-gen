It belongs to the family Cercidifolium, characterized by its alternate, simple leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Euonymus mongolicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
