    "intro": "Erica tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form and its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure and strong winds. Erica tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to attract pollinators. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
