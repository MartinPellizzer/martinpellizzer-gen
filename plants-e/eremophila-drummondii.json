    "intro": "Eremophila drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's eremophila, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, featuring small, leathery leaves to reduce water loss. Eremophila drummondii is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited for drought-tolerant landscaping."
