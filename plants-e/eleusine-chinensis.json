    "intro": "Eleusine chinensis, commonly known as false rice, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to greenish flowers. Its seeds are often mistaken for rice due to their similar appearance, leading to its common name. Eleusine chinensis is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
