    "intro": "Erythraea plumieri, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in its native habitat."
