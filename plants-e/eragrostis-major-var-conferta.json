    "intro": "Eragrostis major var. conferta, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value is appreciated in landscaping for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
