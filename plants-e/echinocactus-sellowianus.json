    "intro": "Echinocactus sellowianus, commonly known as the Sellow's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in arid gardens."
