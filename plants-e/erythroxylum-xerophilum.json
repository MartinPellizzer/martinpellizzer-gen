    "intro": "Erythroxylum xerophilum, commonly known as the desert tobacco plant, is a shrub native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds, and it has been historically used for its mild psychoactive properties. Due to its resilience, it is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
