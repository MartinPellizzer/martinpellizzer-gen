The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, typically during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Eremophila perglandulosa is often used in native gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
