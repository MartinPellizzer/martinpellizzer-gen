    "intro": "Eriogonum polyceps, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually branched and sturdy. Eriogonum polyceps plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
