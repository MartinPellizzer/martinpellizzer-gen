    "intro": "Elymus virginicus f. lasiolepis, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves that are covered with a dense layer of short hairs, giving it a silky appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other damp habitats. This form is considered a subspecies or form of Elymus virginicus and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
