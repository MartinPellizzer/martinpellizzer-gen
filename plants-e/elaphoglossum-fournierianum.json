    "intro": "Elaphoglossum fournierianum, commonly known as the Fournier's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Elaphoglossum fournierianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
