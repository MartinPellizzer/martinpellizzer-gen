    "intro": "Euphorbia ferdowsiana, commonly known as the Persian spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Iran. It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, adapting to its harsh environment. Euphorbia ferdowsiana is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
