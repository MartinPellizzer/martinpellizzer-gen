    "intro": "Elaphoglossum auricomum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. Elaphoglossum auricomum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
