    "intro": "Euphorbia mauritanica var. lignosa, commonly known as the hardy spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North Africa. It features thick, woody stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts, typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
