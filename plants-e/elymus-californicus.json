    "intro": "Elymus californicus, commonly known as California wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense array of spikelets, which are the characteristic units of grass flowers. Elymus californicus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
