    "intro": "Epipogium aphyllum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. The plant produces a single, showy white flower that is often mistaken for a ghostly apparition due to its ethereal appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
