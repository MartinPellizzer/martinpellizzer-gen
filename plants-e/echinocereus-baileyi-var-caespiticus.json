    "intro": "Echinocereus baileyi var. caespiticus, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a compact, mound-forming cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense clusters of cylindrical stems covered in pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are pollinated by bees and other insects. It is well adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
