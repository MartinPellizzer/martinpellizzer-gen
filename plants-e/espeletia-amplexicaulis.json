    "intro": "Espeletia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the \"Candelabra Plant,\" is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, dark green leaves that tightly hug the stem. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence topped with showy yellow flowers, which bloom in the dry season. Its thick, succulent leaves help it store water, allowing it to survive in high-altitude, arid environments. This species is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat."
