    "intro": "Ephedra valida, commonly known as the smooth ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and red berries, which are adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Ephedra valida is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its historical use in traditional medicine has led to its study for potential pharmacological properties."
