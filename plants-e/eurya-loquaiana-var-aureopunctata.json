    "intro": "Eurya loquaiana var. aureopunctata, commonly known as the golden-punctured eurya, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal floral display. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
