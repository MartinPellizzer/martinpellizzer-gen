It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and conservation areas."
