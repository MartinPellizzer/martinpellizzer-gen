    "intro": "Eucalyptus mediocris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Eucalyptus mediocris is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and resilience to harsh conditions. Its bark is often flaky or peeling, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
