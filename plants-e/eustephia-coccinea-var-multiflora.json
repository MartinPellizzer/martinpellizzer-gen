It is characterized by its striking red or orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with simple, opposite leaves that are oval in shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and relatively low maintenance requirements."
