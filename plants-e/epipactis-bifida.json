    "intro": "Epipactis bifida, commonly known as the divided helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, pleated leaves that are often divided into two lobes. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Epipactis bifida is notable for its complex floral structure and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and moths."
