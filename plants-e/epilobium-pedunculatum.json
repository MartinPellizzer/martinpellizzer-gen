It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in moist habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
