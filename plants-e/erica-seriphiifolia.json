    "intro": "Erica seriphiifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erica seriphiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
