    "intro": "Eruca setulosa, commonly known as wild mustard or field mustard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring slender, branching stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by pods containing several seeds. Eruca setulosa is known for its peppery flavor and is sometimes used in culinary applications, though it is more commonly found in wild habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed soils."
