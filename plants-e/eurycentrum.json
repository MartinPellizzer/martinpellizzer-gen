It consists of several species native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plants are characterized by their yellow or golden-colored flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Eurycentrum species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands.
