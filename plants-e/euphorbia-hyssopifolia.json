    "intro": "Euphorbia hyssopifolia, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. Its unique appearance and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a distinctive addition to xeriscapes and rock gardens."
