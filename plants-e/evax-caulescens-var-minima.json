    "intro": "Evax caulescens var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf evax, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring compact, rosette-like foliage. The leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in clusters, blooming during the cooler months. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to rocky, well-drained soils."
