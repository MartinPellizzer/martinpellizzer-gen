    "intro": "Eucalyptus distans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pink, which are typically clustered in groups of three. Its bark is usually smooth and peels in thin layers, revealing a mottled or flaky appearance. Eucalyptus distans is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora."
