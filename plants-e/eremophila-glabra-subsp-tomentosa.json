    "intro": "Eremophila glabra subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly emu bush, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in coastal and inland regions, growing in open woodlands or heathlands. Eremophila glabra subsp. tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
