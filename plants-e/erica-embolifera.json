    "intro": "Erica embolifera, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a hardy shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt-laden winds and coastal conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it suitable for coastal landscaping. Erica embolifera plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
