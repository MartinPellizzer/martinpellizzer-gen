    "intro": "Epidendrum catillus, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, thin, and often pendulous stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Epidendrum catillus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
