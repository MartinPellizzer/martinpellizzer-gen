    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 haukeanum, commonly known as the hybrid horse tail, is a sterile hybrid of two species of horsetail. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorls of small, needle-like leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. It lacks true leaves and reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its structure resembles its parent species but exhibits unique morphological traits due to its hybrid origin."
