    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudoglobosa subsp. pseudoglobosa, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
