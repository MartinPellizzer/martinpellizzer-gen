    "intro": "Echinocereus santaritensis subsp. bacanorensis, commonly known as the Santa Rita hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus with a compact, rounded stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, thick pedicels. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
