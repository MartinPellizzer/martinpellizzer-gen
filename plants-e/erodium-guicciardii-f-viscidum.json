    "intro": "Erodium guicciardii f. viscidum, commonly known as the sticky erodium, is a variant of the annual herb native to California. It is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and coastal areas. Its foliage is often covered in viscid (sticky) hairs, which aid in water retention and may deter herbivores. This subspecies is part of the Geraniaceae family and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
