    "intro": "Euphorbia guerichiana, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its fleshy, stem-like leaves and a flowering structure called a cyathium, which contains small yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Euphorbia guerichiana is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
