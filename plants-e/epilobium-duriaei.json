    "intro": "Epilobium duriaei, commonly known as the Sierra Valley willowherb, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Epilobium duriaei is part of the Onagraceae family, which includes other familiar plants like willows and evening primroses."
