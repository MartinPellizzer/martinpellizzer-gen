    "intro": "Eriocaulon dendroides, commonly known as the tree-like spikerush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure that resembles a small tree, with numerous slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. It thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
