    "intro": "Erodium beketowii, commonly known as the Bektow's common eryngo, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erodium beketowii is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments."
