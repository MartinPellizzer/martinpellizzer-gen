    "intro": "Elaeagnus glabra, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Elaeagnus glabra is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of wood."
