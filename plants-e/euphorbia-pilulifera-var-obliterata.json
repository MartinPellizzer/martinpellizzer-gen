    "intro": "Euphorbia pilulifera var. obliterata, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and almost ghostly appearance, with fleshy, pale green stems that resemble small pills. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically hidden beneath its foliage. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in its native region."
