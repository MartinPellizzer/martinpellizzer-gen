    "intro": "Euphorbia panacea, commonly known as the miracle plant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care. Despite its defensive properties, Euphorbia panacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
