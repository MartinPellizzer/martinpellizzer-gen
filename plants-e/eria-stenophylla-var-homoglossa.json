    "intro": "Eria stenophylla var. homoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed eria, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
