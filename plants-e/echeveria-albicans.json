It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of pale pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
