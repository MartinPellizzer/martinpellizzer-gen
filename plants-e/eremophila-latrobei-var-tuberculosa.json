    "intro": "Eremophila latrobei var. tuberculosa, commonly known as the Woolly Emu Bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces striking spikes of tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is well-suited to rocky soils and is often used in dryland landscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
