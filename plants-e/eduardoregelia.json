These plants are characterized by their large, velvety leaves and showy, often colorful flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Eduardoregelia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The genus is named in honor of Eduard Regel, a 19th-century German botanist."
