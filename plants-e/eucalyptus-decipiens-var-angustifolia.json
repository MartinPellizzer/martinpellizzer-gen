    "intro": "Eucalyptus decipiens var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that gives it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green to yellowish in color. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
