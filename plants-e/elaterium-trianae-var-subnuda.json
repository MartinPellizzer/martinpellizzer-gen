    "intro": "Elaterium trianae var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked elaterium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it forms dense clusters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
