    "intro": "Echinospermum strictum, commonly known as the spiked sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called pappi, which contain seeds adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
