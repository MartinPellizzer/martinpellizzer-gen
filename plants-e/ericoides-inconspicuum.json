    "intro": "Ericoides inconspicuum, commonly known as the inconspicuous heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to maritime climates with high salt exposure. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, usually greenish or white, and appear in clusters during the summer months. Ericoides inconspicuum is valued for its resilience and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness."
