    "intro": "Euphorbia montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevideo spurge, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in soft, greenish-gray leaves that are often tinged with red. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
