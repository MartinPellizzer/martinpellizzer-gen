    "intro": "Eutrema himalaicum, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Eutrema himalaicum is adapted to cold, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions."
