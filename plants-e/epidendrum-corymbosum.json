    "intro": "Epidendrum corymbosum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, colorful flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and dark green, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum corymbosum is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
