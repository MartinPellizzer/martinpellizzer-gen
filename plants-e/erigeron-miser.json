It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and prairies. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Erigeron miser is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
