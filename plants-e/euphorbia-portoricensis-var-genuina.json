    "intro": "Euphorbia portoricensis var. genuina, commonly known as the Puerto Rican euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
