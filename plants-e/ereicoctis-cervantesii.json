    "intro": "Ereicoctis cervantesii, commonly known as the Cervantes' ericaceous plant, is a rare species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
