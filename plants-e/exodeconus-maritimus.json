    "intro": "Exodeconus maritimus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers and silver-blue foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters that stabilize sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which provide additional protection against harsh coastal conditions. Exodeconus maritimus is well adapted to salt spray and can thrive in areas with limited freshwater availability."
