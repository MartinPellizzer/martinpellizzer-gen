    "intro": "Epidendrum purdiei, commonly known as the Pink Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescence and vibrant pink to purple flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Epidendrum purdiei is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
