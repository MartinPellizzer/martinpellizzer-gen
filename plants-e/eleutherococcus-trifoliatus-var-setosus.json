    "intro": "Eleutherococcus trifoliatus var. setosus, commonly known as the Siberian ginseng, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are three-lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its adaptability and medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for centuries."
