    "intro": "Epidanthus goniorhachis, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid's flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, making it a popular choice for collectors and horticulturists."
