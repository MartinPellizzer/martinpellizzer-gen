    "intro": "Euphorbia sclerophylla var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its stems. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscaped gardens."
