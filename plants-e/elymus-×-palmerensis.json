    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 palmerensis, commonly known as the Palmer's wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in arid environments. Elymus \u00d7 palmerensis is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open plains."
