    "intro": "Eulophia dactylifera, commonly known as the date palm orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are often white or pale yellow and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. The orchid's rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
