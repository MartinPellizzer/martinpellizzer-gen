    "intro": "Euonymus europaeus subsp. subvelutinus, commonly known as the European spindle-tree, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The subspecies subvelutinus is distinguished by its more velvety foliage compared to the typical form."
