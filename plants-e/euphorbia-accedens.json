It features a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its characteristic inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
