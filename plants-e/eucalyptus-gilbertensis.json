    "intro": "Eucalyptus gilbertensis, commonly known as Gilbert's mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern Australia, particularly in South Australia and Victoria, where it grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed habit and smooth, often greyish bark. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a distinctive aromatic scent. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding insects and birds."
