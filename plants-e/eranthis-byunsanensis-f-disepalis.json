It is characterized by its striking, early spring flowers that typically bloom before the leaves emerge. The plant features showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a darker central stripe. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in woodland or shaded areas. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
