    "intro": "Encyclia insidiosa, commonly known as the insidious orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Encyclia insidiosa is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
