    "intro": "Eulophia taitensis, commonly known as the Tait's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tahiti. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy inflorescence. Eulophia taitensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
