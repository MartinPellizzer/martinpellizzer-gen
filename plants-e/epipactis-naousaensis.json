    "intro": "Epipactis naousaensis, commonly known as the Naousa marsh orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the wetlands of Greece. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species."
