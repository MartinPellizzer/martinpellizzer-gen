    "intro": "Epidendrum leptopetalum, commonly known as the slender-petaled epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a distinctive, elongated lip that aids in pollination. Epidendrum leptopetalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
