It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and daisy-like flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Erigeron species."
