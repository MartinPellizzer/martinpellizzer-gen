    "intro": "Erythrina holosericea, commonly known as the red flame tree, is a striking tropical legume native to parts of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, flame-colored flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Erythrina holosericea is well adapted to warm, sunny climates and is often used in landscaping due to its vibrant floral display. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a popular choice in urban and rural settings alike."
