    "intro": "Elaeodendron cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban elaeodendron, is a tropical shrub native to Cuba. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in coastal areas and limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
