    "intro": "Echinocactus cornigerus, commonly known as the Mexican horsehair cactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in white, hair-like spines that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
