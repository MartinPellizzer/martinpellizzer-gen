    "intro": "Evolvulus argenteus, commonly known as silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
