    "intro": "Epidendrum geminiflorum, commonly known as the twin-flower orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Epidendrum geminiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
