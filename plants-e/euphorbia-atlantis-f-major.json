    "intro": "Euphorbia atlantis f. major, commonly known as the Atlantis euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
