    "intro": "Echium paniculatum, commonly known as the purpleweed or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking spikes of purple or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has blue-green leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It grows upright, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Echium paniculatum is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient species."
