    "intro": "Erigeron scandens, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features a sprawling, woody stem that can reach up to 6 feet in height, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy blue to purple flowers, which appear in late summer, are composed of both ray and disk florets, making it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
