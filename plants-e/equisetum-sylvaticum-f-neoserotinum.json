    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum f. neoserotinum, commonly known as the dark-stemmed field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are typically dark green to black in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
