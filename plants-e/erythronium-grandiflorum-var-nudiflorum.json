    "intro": "Erythronium grandiflorum var. nudiflorum, commonly known as the nakedflower dogtooth violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that emerge from a tuberous root system. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring before the leaves fully expand. Its flowers are borne on long, slender stalks and are characterized by their distinctive spurred tips. This variety is notable for its unique floral structure and is valued in botanical gardens for its ornamental appeal."
