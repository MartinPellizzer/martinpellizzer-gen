    "intro": "Elaeodendron stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's elaeodendron, is a rare and woody shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
