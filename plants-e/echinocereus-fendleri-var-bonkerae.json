    "intro": "[WRONG START] Echinocereus fendleri var. bonkeraa, commonly known as the Bonkerae hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, fleshy stems and a reduced leaf structure. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
