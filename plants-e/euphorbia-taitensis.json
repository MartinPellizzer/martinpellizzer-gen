    "intro": "Euphorbia taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the island of Taiti in the South Pacific. It features a distinctive, spiny stem with a thick, fleshy texture that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, providing some protection from the sun. Euphorbia taitensis is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
