    "intro": "Evolvulus cordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a vine that typically grows along the ground or climbing supports, with tendrils that help it attach to surfaces. Its flowers are short-lived, lasting only a day, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Evolvulus cordatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
