    "intro": "Eugenia buxifolia var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf waxleaf eugenia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is prized for its dense foliage and ornamental appeal, making it a popular choice for hedges and container gardening. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is well-suited for small spaces and requires well-drained soil and partial shade."
