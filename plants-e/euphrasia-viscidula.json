    "intro": "Euphrasia viscidula, commonly known as sticky toadflax, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sticky hairs on the stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance and aid in seed dispersal."
