    "intro": "Endocomia macrocoma subsp. macrocoma, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 5 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
