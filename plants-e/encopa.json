    "intro": "Encopa, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the United States. It belongs to the genus Tithonia in the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers. The plant is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Encopa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant colors and ability to thrive in full sun. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of nectar for honey production."
