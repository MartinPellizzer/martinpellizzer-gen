    "intro": "Epipogium kusukusense, commonly known as the Kusukusen ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. Native to the cloud forests of Papua New Guinea, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with rich organic soil. The plant produces small, white, non-showy flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and highly vulnerable to environmental changes."
