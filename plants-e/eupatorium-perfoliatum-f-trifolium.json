    "intro": "Eupatorium perfoliatum f. trifolium, commonly known as the three-leaved boneset, is a variant of the boneset plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats like meadows and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
