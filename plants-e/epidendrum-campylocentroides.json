    "intro": "Epidendrum campylocentroides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and long, pendulous inflorescences. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive red lip, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum campylocentroides is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
