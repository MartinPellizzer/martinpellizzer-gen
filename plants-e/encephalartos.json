    "intro": "Encephalartos, commonly known as the cycad, is a genus of plants native to Africa, characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, feathery leaves. These plants are gymnosperms, meaning they produce seeds but do not flower, and they have a unique ability to store water in their thick, fleshy stems. Encephalartos species typically grow in rocky or well-drained soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Their leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and they can live for many decades, sometimes even centuries. Due to their ancient lineage, they are considered living fossils, offering insights into early plant evolution."
