    "intro": "Eriophorum cannabina, commonly known as the lesser cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wet, acidic environments in the northern hemisphere. It produces small, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which aid in wind dispersal. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in peat bogs and marshes. It is often found in regions with cool, moist climates. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
