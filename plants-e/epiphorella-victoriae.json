    "intro": "Epiphorella victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria's epiphyte, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its growth is closely tied to humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
