    "intro": "Edmonstonia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. Edmonstonia species are typically grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments and indirect light. They have a short stem and produce flowers on terminal shoots, making them popular for indoor gardening. The genus includes several species, such as Edmonstonia elata, which is known for its striking purple flowers."
