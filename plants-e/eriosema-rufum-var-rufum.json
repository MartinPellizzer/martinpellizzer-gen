    "intro": "Eriosema rufum var. rufum, commonly known as the red-leaved eriosema, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-orange. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and modest floral display."
