    "intro": "Evelyna flavescens, commonly known as the golden leaf fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a faint golden hue under sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture in its soil. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
