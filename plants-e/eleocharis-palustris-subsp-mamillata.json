    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris subsp. mamillata, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
