    "intro": "Euphorbia nemoralis, commonly known as the wood spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features a distinctive stem with yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in yellowish cup-like structures called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant contains latex, which can cause skin irritation, and is often used in traditional medicine."
