    "intro": "Epithema brunonis var. strigosum, commonly known as the hairy epithema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, brownish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Small, inconspicuous white flowers appear in late spring, followed by cylindrical seed pods that split open to disperse seeds. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats."
