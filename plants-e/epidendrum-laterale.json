    "intro": "Epidendrum laterale, commonly known as the lateral epidendron, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, with petals that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum laterale is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
