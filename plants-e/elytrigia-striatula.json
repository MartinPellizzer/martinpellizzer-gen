It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Elytrigia striatula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various insects and small mammals."
