    "intro": "Epilobium tetragonum var. glandulosum, commonly known as sticky willow or glandular willow, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its quadrangular, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with glandular dots. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in terminal spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its attractive appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
