    "intro": "Eugenia henryi, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
