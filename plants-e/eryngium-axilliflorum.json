    "intro": "Eryngium axilliflorum, commonly known as the lesser thistle or narrow-leaved eryngium, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom in summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Eryngium axilliflorum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its distinctive appearance and hardy nature."
