    "intro": "Euphorbia dioeca var. indivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescence, and it is known for its toxic sap containing latex. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates."
