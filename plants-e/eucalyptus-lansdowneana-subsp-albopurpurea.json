    "intro": "Eucalyptus lansdowneana subsp. albopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-veined ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, revealing a lighter underbark. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive white or purple vein pattern, which gives it its common name. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
