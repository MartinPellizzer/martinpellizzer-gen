    "intro": "Eragrostis rubida, commonly known as red\u9896\u8349, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to reddish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Eragrostis rubida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
