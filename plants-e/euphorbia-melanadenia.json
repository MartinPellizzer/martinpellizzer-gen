    "intro": "Euphorbia melanadenia, commonly known as the black-adenium euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its stems. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
