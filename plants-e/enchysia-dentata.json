    "intro": "Enchysia dentata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous annual with distinctive, toothed leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to saline and brackish environments, making it a common sight in estuaries and tidal flats. Enchysia dentata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
