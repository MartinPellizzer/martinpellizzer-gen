    "intro": "Erica petricola, commonly known as the heath leek, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, leathery leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the late winter and early spring. Erica petricola is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
