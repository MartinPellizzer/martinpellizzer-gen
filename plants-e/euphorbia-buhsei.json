    "intro": "Euphorbia buhsei, commonly known as the Buhsei spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling should be done with care."
