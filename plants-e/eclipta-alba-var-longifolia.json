    "intro": "Eclipta alba var. longifolia, commonly known as white ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine, though it is also considered a weed in agricultural settings."
