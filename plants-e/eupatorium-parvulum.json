    "intro": "Eupatorium parvulum, commonly known as white snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is toxic to livestock. Eupatorium parvulum is also known for its role in the historical spread of tetanus through milk."
