    "intro": "Euphorbia leptoclada, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
