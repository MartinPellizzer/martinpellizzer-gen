    "intro": "Epidendrum urichianum, commonly known as the Urich's Epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red in color, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
