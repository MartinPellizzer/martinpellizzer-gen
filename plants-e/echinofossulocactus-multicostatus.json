    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus multicostatus, commonly known as the Mexican sunburst cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
