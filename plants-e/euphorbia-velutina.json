    "intro": "Euphorbia velutina, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a soft, velvety coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Euphorbia velutina is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry climates."
