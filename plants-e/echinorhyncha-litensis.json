    "intro": "Echinorhyncha litensis, commonly known as the Litland thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
