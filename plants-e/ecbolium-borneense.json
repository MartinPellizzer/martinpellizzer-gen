    "intro": "Ecbolium borneense, commonly known as the Bornean ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture. Due to habitat loss, Ecbolium borneense is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
