    "intro": "Echinops galaticus, commonly known as the cosmic thistle, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, spherical seed heads that resemble miniature comets, giving it its whimsical common name. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy landscapes. Its blue or purple flowers bloom in late summer, adding a dramatic visual element to the landscape. The plant is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
