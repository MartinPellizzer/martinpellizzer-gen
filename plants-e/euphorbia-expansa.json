    "intro": "Euphorbia expansa, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in spiny, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions. However, its milky sap can be toxic and irritating to the skin."
