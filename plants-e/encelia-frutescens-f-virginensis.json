It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting native pollinators."
