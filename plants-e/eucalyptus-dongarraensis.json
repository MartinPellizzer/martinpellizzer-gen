    "intro": "Eucalyptus dongarraensis, commonly known as the eastern grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often peels in strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The species is known for its aromatic oils, which are released when the leaves are crushed, contributing to its ecological and medicinal significance. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Eucalyptus dongarraensis plays an important role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
