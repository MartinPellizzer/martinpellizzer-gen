    "intro": "Eriocaulon shrirangii, commonly known as the Himalayan spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
