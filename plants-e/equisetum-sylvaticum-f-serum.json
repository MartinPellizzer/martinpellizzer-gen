    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum f. serum, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its primitive morphology reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
