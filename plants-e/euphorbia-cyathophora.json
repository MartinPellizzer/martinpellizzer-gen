    "intro": "Euphorbia cyathophora, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring woody stems covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, is a characteristic feature of the Euphorbia genus. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
