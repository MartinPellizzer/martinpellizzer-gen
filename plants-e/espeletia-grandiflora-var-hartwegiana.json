    "intro": "Espeletia grandiflora var. hartwegiana, commonly known as the Hartweg's heath, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, tubular inflorescences that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high UV exposure. Its leaves are thick and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, where it plays a role in local biodiversity."
