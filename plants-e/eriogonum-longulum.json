    "intro": "Eriogonum longulum, commonly known as the longstem buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, elliptical seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across arid regions. Eriogonum longulum is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in ecosystems with limited water availability."
