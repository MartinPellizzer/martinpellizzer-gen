    "intro": "Encyclia schaeferi, commonly known as the Schaefer's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a pseudobulb with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the dry season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and rain. Encyclia schaeferi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cultivation."
