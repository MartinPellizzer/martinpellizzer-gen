    "intro": "Eucalyptus ovalifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed tree or shrub form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The flowers are usually small and white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and they attract a variety of pollinators. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Its essential oils, like those of other eucalyptus species, have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
