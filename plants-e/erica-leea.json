    "intro": "Erica leea, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. Erica leea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for local pollinators."
