    "intro": "Elaphoglossum villosum var. poeppigianum, commonly known as the hairy holly fern, is a variant of the hairy holly fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions, making it a characteristic component of tropical understory vegetation."
