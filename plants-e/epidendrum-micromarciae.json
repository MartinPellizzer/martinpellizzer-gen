    "intro": "Epidendrum micromarciae, commonly known as the miniature pink epidendrum, is a compact orchid species native to Mexico. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers with a distinct, sweet fragrance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
