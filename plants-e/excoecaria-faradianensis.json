    "intro": "Excoecaria faradianensis, commonly known as the Faradian's croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires caution in handling."
