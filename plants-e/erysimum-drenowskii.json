    "intro": "Erysimum drenowskii, commonly known as the Drenowsky's wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its bright yellow or orange flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
