    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery white coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
