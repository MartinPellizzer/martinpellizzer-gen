    "intro": "Epipactis phyllanthes subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand epipactis, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green to brownish leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in sandy or calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as heaths and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
