    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum f. elegans, commonly known as the slender horse tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a central stem that remains green throughout the year. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait common among ancient plant species. The plant's structure reflects its evolutionary history, showcasing features similar to those of early vascular plants."
