    "intro": "Elaeocarpus pagonensis, commonly known as the Pagon Island elaeocarpus, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific islands, particularly found in regions like the Mariana and Caroline Islands. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a keystone species in island ecosystems, supporting a variety of bird and insect species."
