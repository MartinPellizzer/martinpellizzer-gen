    "intro": "Elaphoglossum bradeanum, commonly known as the Brade's harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile pinnae that produce spores on the undersides of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the understory flora."
