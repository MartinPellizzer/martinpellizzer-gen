It is an annual herb that typically grows in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant has hairy, branching stems and small, pale green leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed but has some historical uses in traditional medicine."
