    "intro": "Epipactis violacea f. chlorophylla, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, but the chlorophylla form exhibits a more greenish hue, distinguishing it from the typical variety. This orchid is a perennial herb, often found in association with other orchid species in its native habitat."
