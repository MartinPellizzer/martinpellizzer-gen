    "intro": "Eupatorium chiquitense, commonly known as the Chiquitano eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Chiquitano Dry Forest of Bolivia and Paraguay. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in the summer, are usually white or pale blue and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eupatorium chiquitense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for local wildlife."
