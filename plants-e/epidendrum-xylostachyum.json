It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
