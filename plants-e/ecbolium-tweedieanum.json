    "intro": "Ecbolium tweedieanum, commonly known as the Tweedie's ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated primarily by insects. Due to habitat loss, Ecbolium tweedieanum is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation."
