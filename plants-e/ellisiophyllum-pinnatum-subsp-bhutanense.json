    "intro": "Ellisiophyllum pinnatum subsp. bhutanense, commonly known as the Bhutanese fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
