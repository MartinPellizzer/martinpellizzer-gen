    "intro": "Eremanthus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flowered eremanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its most distinctive feature is the single, showy flower that appears at the tip of each stem, often in shades of yellow or orange. Eremanthus uniflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
