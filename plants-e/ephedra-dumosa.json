    "intro": "Ephedra dumosa, commonly known as the desert tea or jointed ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Ephedra dumosa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. It has been historically used by Indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties."
