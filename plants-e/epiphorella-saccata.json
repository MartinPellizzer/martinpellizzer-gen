    "intro": "Epiphorella saccata, commonly known as the sac-like epiphorella, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thallus that is usually green or yellowish in color, with a distinct, sac-like structure that gives it its common name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flat, ribbon-like body called a thallus. Epiphorella saccata is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
