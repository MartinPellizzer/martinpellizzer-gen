    "intro": "Eucalyptus stockeri, commonly known as the yellow box, is a tall, slender tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish hue beneath, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Eucalyptus stockeri is an important component of the ecological communities it inhabits, providing shelter and food for various native fauna."
