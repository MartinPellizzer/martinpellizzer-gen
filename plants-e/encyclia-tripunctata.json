    "intro": "Encyclia tripunctata, commonly known as the three-spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, with three distinct spots on the lip of each flower. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Encyclia tripunctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
