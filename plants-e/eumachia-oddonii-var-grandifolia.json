    "intro": "Eumachia oddonii var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered eumachia, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in forest understory communities."
