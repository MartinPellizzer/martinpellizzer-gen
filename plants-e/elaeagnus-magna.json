It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and compound leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Elaeagnus magna is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to fix nitrogen, which enriches the soil."
