    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 leckenbyi, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Great Basin of North America. It is a hybrid between Elymus trachycoleus and Elymus wrightii, characterized by its tall, stiff stalks and dense, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned seeds. Due to its hardiness and drought tolerance, it is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
