    "intro": "Elaeocarpus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal elaeocarpus, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Elaeocarpus littoralis is often found in sandy or coastal soils, where it contributes to stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
