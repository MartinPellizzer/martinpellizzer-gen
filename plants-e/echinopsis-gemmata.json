    "intro": "Echinopsis gemmata, commonly known as the \"Candelabra Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that resemble a candlestick, which are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis gemmata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and hardy nature."
