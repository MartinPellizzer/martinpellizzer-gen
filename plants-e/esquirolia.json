    "intro": "Esquirolia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plants typically have succulent leaves and stems, which help them conserve water in dry environments. Esquirolia species are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
