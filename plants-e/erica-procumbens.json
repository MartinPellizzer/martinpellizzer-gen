    "intro": "Erica procumbens, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage consisting of small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica procumbens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
