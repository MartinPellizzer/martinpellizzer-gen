    "intro": "Eugenia sloanei, commonly known as the Sloane's evergreen or the Brazilian cherry, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree produces bright red, cherry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Eugenia sloanei thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal and lowland forest regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical areas."
