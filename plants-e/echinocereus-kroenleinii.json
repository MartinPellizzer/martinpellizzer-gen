It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 inches. The plant features a cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and produces white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This cactus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
