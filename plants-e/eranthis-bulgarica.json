It is characterized by its early blooming habit, typically appearing in late winter or early spring. The plant features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that emerge from a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. It prefers well-drained, loamy soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens for its early-season floral display."
