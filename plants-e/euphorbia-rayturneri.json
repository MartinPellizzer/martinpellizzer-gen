    "intro": "Euphorbia rayturneri, commonly known as the Rayturner's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia rayturneri is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
