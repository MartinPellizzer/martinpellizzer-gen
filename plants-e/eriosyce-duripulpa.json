    "intro": "Eriosyce duripulpa, commonly known as the rock cactus or stone cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne near the top of the stems. Eriosyce duripulpa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its unique morphology and ability to store water in its stems make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in the cactus family."
