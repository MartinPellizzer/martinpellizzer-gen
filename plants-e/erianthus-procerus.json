    "intro": "Erianthus procerus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of prairie and savanna ecosystems. Erianthus procerus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
