    "intro": "Elatine glomerata, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Elatinaceae. It typically grows in wet environments such as marshes, ponds, and stream edges, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, white or pink flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Elatine glomerata is also notable for its ability to survive in both freshwater and brackish environments."
