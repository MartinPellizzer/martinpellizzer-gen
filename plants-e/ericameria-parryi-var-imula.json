    "intro": "Ericameria parryi var. imula, commonly known as the desert goldenbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry slopes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in desert landscapes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
