It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in freshwater environments with moderate to high light exposure and is often used in aquariums for its ornamental value. Echinodorus grandiflorus is also valued for its ability to help oxygenate water and provide shelter for aquatic life."
