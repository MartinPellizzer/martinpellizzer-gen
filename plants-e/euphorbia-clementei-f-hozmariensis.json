    "intro": "Euphorbia clementei f. hozmariensis, commonly known as the Hozmariensis spurge, is a variant of the Euphorbia clementei species, which is native to the Canary Islands. This plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The leaves are usually alternate and can be lance-shaped or ovate, depending on the growth conditions. It produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
