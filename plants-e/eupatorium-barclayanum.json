    "intro": "Eupatorium barclayanum, commonly known as Barclay's boneset, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in composite inflorescences, typically blooming from late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
