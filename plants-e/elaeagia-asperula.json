    "intro": "Elaeagia asperula, commonly known as the roughleaf elaeagnus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruits are small, berry-like drupes that contain a single seed. Elaeagia asperula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
