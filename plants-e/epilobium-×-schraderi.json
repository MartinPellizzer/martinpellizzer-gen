    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 schraderi, commonly known as the hybrid willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape with serrated margins. It produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
