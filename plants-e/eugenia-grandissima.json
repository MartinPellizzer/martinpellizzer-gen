    "intro": "Eugenia grandissima, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its edible red berries, which are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
