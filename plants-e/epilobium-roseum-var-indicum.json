It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
