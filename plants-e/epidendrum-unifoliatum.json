    "intro": "Epidendrum unifoliatum, commonly known as the single-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum unifoliatum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
