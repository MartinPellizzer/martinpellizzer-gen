It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its variability in leaf and flower color makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
