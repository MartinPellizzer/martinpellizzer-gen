It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils. Eutaxia andocada plays a role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
