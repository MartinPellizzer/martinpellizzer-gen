    "intro": "Eriogonum fasciculatum var. aspalathoides, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, globular clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is well adapted to arid environments. The yellow globemallow is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
