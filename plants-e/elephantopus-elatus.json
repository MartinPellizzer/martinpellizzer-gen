It is characterized by its large, fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a rosette pattern. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
