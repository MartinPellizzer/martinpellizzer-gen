    "intro": "Eurya japonica var. aurescens, commonly known as the golden eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features small, elliptical leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in temperate climates."
