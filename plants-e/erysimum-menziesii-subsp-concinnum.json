    "intro": "Erysimum menziesii subsp. concinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wallflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features upright stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas."
