It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive appearance due to its star-shaped inflorescence. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its overall appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in coastal gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
