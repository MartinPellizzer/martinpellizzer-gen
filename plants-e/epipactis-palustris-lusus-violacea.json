    "intro": "Epipactis palustris lusus violacea, commonly known as the purple marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a striking violet or purple flower spike that bears showy, lip-like flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of water bodies. It is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early summer. The orchid has a complex symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its growth and reproduction."
