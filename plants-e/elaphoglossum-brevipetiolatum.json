    "intro": "Elaphoglossum brevipetiolatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed holly fern, is a perennial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its finely divided, glossy, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically has a short petiole, giving it its common name, and the fronds are often covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Elaphoglossum brevipetiolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
