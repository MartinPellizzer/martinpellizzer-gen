    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. simplicissimum, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that thrives in wet, marshy environments. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. It has a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and is one of the few remaining primitive vascular plants. Its presence in wetlands indicates good water quality and plays a role in stabilizing soil in these habitats."
