    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus var. tephrops, commonly known as the alpine blue fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds in its natural habitat."
