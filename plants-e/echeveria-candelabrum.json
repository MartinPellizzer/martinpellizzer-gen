It features a rosette-shaped stem with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear clusters of violet or pink flowers. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit. Echeveria candelabrum requires bright sunlight, well-draining soil, and minimal water to thrive."
