It is characterized by its basal leaves that are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
