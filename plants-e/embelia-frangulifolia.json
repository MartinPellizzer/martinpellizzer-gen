    "intro": "[WRONG START] Embilia frangulifolia, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or embelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible. The fruits contain several seeds and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
