    "intro": "Eugenia calcadensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *cereja-brasileira*, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, red, cherry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Eugenia calcadensis thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a hedge plant."
