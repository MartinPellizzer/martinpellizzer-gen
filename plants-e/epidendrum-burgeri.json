    "intro": "Epidendrum burgeri, commonly known as the Burger's Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, yellow, and orange. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, allowing it to thrive in less-than-ideal conditions. Epidendrum burgeri is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
