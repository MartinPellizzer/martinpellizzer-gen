    "intro": "Eulophus californicus var. sanctorum, commonly known as the Sanctorum Eulophus, is a variant of the Eulophus californicus, a species of wasp. It is primarily found in the western United States, particularly in California. This plant, though not a plant in the traditional sense, is a type of parasitic wasp that plays a role in biological control of other insect pests. The species is notable for its specific host preferences and ecological niche within its habitat. Its presence is often associated with certain plant species that serve as hosts for its larvae."
