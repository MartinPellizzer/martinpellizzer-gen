It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
