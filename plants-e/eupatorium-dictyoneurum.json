    "intro": "Eupatorium dictyoneurum, commonly known as the clustered boneset, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium dictyoneurum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
