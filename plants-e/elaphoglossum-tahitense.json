    "intro": "Elaphoglossum tahitense, commonly known as the Tahiti holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tahiti and other islands in French Polynesia. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure, giving it a lacy appearance. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Elaphoglossum tahitense is often found in coastal forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
