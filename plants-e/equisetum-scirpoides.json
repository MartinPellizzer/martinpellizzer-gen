    "intro": "Equisetum scirpoides, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green or yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, often wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. Equisetum scirpoides is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and is considered a living fossil."
