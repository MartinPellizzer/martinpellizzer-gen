    "intro": "Erythrostemon hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's thimbleweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
