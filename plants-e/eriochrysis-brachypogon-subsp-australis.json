    "intro": "Eriochrysis brachypogon subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian hairgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and salt marshes. Eriochrysis brachypogon subsp. australis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
