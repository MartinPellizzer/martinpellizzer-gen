It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
