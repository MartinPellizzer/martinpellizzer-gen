    "intro": "Elymus parviglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a compact panicle with spikelets that are usually shorter than the nodes. Elymus parviglumis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
