    "intro": "Euonymus bullatus, commonly known as the woolly euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The leaves are typically dark green with a powdery white coating, and they turn reddish in the fall. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique texture and seasonal color changes."
