    "intro": "Elymus formosanus, commonly known as the Formosan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem, with each spikelet containing several small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Elymus formosanus is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
