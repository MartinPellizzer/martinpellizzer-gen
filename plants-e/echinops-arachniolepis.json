    "intro": "Echinops arachniolepis, commonly known as the spider-horned thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a cluster of small, hooked spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, woolly bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Echinops arachniolepis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
