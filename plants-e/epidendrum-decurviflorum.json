    "intro": "Epidendrum decurviflorum, commonly known as the curly-flower epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Epidendrum decurviflorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
