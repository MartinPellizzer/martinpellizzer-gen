    "intro": "Elaeocarpus grandis, commonly known as the giant elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy green leaves and showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces round, woody fruits that contain a single large seed, which is encased in a hard, smooth shell. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
