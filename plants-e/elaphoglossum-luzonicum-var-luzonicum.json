    "intro": "Elaphoglossum luzonicum var. luzonicum, commonly known as the Luzon holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal."
