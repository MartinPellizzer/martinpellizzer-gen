It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This subspecies is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in alpine and subalpine regions. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are distinctive in their structure. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its historical and ecological significance."
