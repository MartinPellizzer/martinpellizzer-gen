    "intro": "Erythroxylum bahiense, commonly known as the Bahia coca, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain seeds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. While not as well-known as other coca species, it shares some botanical similarities with Erythroxylum coca, including the presence of alkaloids in its leaves."
