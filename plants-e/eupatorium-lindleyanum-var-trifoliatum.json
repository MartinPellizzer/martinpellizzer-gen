    "intro": "Eupatorium lindleyanum var. trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called cymes. These flowers bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
