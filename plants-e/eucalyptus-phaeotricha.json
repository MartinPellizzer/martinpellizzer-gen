    "intro": "Eucalyptus phaeotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, greyish-white pubescence. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale yellow to cream in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its bark is often flaky and peels away in thin layers, revealing a pale or reddish underbark. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
