    "intro": "Epilobium anglicum, commonly known as common willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with erect, often branched stems covered in fine hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are clustered in dense, showy spikes at the top of the plant. The plant produces small, reddish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
