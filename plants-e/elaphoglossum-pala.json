    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pala, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Elaphoglossum pala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
