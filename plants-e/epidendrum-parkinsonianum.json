    "intro": "Epidendrum parkinsonianum, commonly known as the Parkinson's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces long, pendulous inflorescences with brightly colored, fragrant flowers. The plant typically has strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum parkinsonianum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
