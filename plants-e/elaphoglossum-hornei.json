    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hornei, commonly known as the Horne's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. This plant is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Elaphoglossum hornei prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its small, spore-producing sorus structures are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
