    "intro": "Epidendrum sagranum, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking orange and yellow flowers, which are often clustered in racemes along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its arid environment. Epidendrum sagranum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
