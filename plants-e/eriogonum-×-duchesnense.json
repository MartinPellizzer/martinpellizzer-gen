    "intro": "Eriogonum \u00d7 duchesnense, commonly known as the Townsend's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.
