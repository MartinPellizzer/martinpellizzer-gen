    "intro": "Egenolfia \u00d7 laxireticulata, commonly known as the hybrid lichen, is a composite organism formed by the symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, often found on bark and stone surfaces. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly cracked surface. It lacks distinct medulla and is usually found in temperate to subtropical regions. This lichen is an important indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
