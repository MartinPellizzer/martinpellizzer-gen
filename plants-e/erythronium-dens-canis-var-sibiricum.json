    "intro": "Erythronium dens-canis var. sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian dog-tooth violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Siberia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, dog-tooth shaped bulbs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a reddish tinge. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that emerge in early spring, adding visual interest before the flowers appear."
