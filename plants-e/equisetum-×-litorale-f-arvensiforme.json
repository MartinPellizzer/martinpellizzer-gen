    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale f. arvensiforme, commonly known as the coastal horsetail, is a hybrid fern that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum litorale and Equisetum arvensile. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, sandy soils, often found along coastal regions and in wetlands. The plant features a tall, slender stem with whorled branches and small, scale-like leaves. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, typical of the Equisetum genus. This fern is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
