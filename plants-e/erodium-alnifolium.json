    "intro": "Erodium alnifolium, commonly known as the alderleaf catchfly, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It features small, delicate pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring, typically from April to June. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in disturbed soils along roadsides and in dry, open areas. It is part of the Geraniaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological traits. Erodium alnifolium plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for some herbivorous insects."
