    "intro": "Eurya ternatana, commonly known as the three-leaf eurya, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its small, elliptical leaves are arranged in whorls of three, giving it its common name. Eurya ternatana produces clusters of tiny, white flowers followed by small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans."
