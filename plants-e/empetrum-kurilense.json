    "intro": "Empetrum kurilense, commonly known as Kuril willow or Siberian willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the cold regions of the Russian Far East, the Kuril Islands, and parts of northern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Empetrum kurilense is well adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
