It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is notable for its spiny, spherical seed heads that provide protection to its seeds and aid in wind dispersal. Echinops avajensis typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
