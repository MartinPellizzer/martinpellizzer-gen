    "intro": "Eucalyptus occidentalis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Western Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its grey, flaky bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine greyish bloom. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid environments."
