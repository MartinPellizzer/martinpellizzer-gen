It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its vibrant yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
