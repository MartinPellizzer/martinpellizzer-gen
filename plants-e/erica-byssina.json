    "intro": "Erica byssina, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. Erica byssina thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for local wildlife."
