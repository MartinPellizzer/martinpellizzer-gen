    "intro": "Eupatorium gynoxymorphum, commonly known as the narrowleaf thoroughwort, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its showy white to pale purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. The leaves are often mistaken for those of other Eupatorium species due to their similar appearance."
