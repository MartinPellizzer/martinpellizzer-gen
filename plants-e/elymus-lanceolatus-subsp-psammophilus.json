    "intro": "Elymus lanceolatus subsp. psammophilus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in sandy soils and contribute to soil stabilization. It is often found in dunes, grasslands, and along the edges of deserts, playing a vital role in ecological succession and habitat provision."
