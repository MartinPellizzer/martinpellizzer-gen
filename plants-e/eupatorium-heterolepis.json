    "intro": "Eupatorium heterolepis, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features rough, hairy stems and opposite, toothed leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, producing small, clustered white to pale blue flowers. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
