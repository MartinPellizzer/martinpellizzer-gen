    "intro": "Excoecaria tristis, commonly known as the croton tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a thick, flaky bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. The leaves and bark contain toxic compounds, making it both a valuable and hazardous plant in its native habitat."
