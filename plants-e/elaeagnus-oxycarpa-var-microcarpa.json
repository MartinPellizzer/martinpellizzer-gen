It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
