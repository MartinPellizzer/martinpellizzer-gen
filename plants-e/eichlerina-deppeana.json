It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fleshy capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds. Eichlerina deppeana is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
