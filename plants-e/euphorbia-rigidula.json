    "intro": "Euphorbia rigidula, commonly known as the rigid milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures, and it is known for its toxic sap containing latex. Euphorbia rigidula is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and nectar for certain insect species."
