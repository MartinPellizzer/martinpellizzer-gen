    "intro": "Euphorbia shehbaziana, commonly known as the Kashmir spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to rocky and mountainous terrains. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
