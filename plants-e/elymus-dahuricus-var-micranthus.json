    "intro": "Elymus dahuricus var. micranthus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered in panicles, each containing small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
