It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its unique appearance and growth habit make it a popular choice for water gardeners and wetland restoration projects."
