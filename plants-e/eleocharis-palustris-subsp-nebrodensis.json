    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris subsp. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, pond margins, and damp soils. The plant features slender, triangular stems with tiny, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. Its leaves are grass-like and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in maintaining wetland biodiversity and soil stability."
