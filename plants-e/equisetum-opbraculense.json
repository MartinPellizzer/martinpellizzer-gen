    "intro": "Equisetum opbraculense, commonly known as the horse tail or scaly willow, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a distinctive, segmented stem that resembles a horse's tail. This plant is typically found in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are located at the top of the plant. Equisetum opbraculense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
