    "intro": "Epilobium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as streambanks and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in loose clusters, and bloom in early summer. Epilobium pubescens is often found in wetland habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
