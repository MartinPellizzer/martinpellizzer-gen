It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often glandular. It produces sporophylls that are clustered in cones, which contain the spores for reproduction. Emplectocladus glandulosus is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
