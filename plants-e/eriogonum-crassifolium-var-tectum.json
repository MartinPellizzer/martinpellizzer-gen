It is characterized by its dense, thick, and leathery leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces showy clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments with poor soil. This variety is often found in foothills and mountainous regions, contributing to the local biodiversity."
