    "intro": "Elaphoglossum schiffneri, commonly known as the Schiffner\u2019s harts-tongue fern, is a species of polypodioid fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a false indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests and rocky habitats. Elaphoglossum schiffneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
