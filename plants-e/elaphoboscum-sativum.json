    "intro": "Elaphoboscum sativum, commonly known as the common wild lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. The latex from its leaves has been used historically for its mild sedative properties."
