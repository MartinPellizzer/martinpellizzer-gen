    "intro": "Eriogonum incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Eriogonum incanum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
