    "intro": "Epidendrum thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, often arranged in dense clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum thompsonii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
