    "intro": "Euphorbia xylophylloides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often modified into spines, a characteristic adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces a milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
