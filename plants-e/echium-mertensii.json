    "intro": "Echium mertensii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its fibrous stems and leaves contain a high concentration of mucilage, which has been used historically for medicinal and textile purposes. Echium mertensii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
