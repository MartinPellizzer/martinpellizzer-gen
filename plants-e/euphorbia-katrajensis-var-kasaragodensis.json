    "intro": "Euphorbia katrajensis var. kasaragodensis, commonly known as the Kasaragod euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually spiny, serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
