    "intro": "Elaeagnus caudata var. caudata, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or dry habitats. Elaeagnus caudata var. caudata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
