    "intro": "Eugenia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular waxleaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
