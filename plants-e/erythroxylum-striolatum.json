    "intro": "Erythroxylum striolatum, commonly known as the striated coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a distinctive striated pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsules containing elliptical, whitish seeds. It is notable for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids, particularly cocaine. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other coca species due to its lower alkaloid content."
