    "intro": "Eriocaulon palustre, commonly known as the marsh spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has a slender, grass-like appearance with cylindrical stems that bear spike-like clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eriocaulon palustre plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
