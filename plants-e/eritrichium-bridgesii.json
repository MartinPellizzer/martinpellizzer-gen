    "intro": "Eritrichium bridgesii, commonly known as the Sierra glacialweed, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is a low-growing perennial with delicate, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are typically basal, clustered at the base, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Eritrichium bridgesii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
