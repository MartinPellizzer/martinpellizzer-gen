    "intro": "Eugenia subdecussata, commonly known as the red-leaved eugenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are often a striking red or purple color, especially when young. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
