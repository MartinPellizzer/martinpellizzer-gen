    "intro": "Endiandra muelleri subsp. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate endiandra, is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lanceolate, glossy leaves. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are borne in clusters, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds. It thrives in lowland tropical rainforests and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
