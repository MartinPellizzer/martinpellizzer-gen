    "intro": "Echinopsis fieldiana, commonly known as the field's moon cactus, is a succulent cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and large, white to pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a spiny exterior with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
