    "intro": "Ecbolium genuflexum, commonly known as the bending euphorbia, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling stem with fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its thick, waxy leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Despite its resilience, Ecbolium genuflexum is sensitive to frost and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
