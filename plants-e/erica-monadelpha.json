    "intro": "Erica monadelpha, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica monadelpha is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value."
