    "intro": "Euphorbia valdevillosocarpa, commonly known as the Valdevi\u00f1osocarpa spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub-like species characterized by its erect stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a unique type of fruit called a cyathium, which is a modified inflorescence typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant is adapted to coastal environments and is often found growing on rocky soils."
