    "intro": "Eucephalus, commonly known as bluebottle, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in dense, spherical clusters. They are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in dry, rocky habitats. Eucephalus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant colors and drought tolerance. The genus includes several species, such as Eucephalus californicus and Eucephalus palmeri, which are adapted to arid environments."
