    "intro": "Erianthemum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rounded, velvety leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in a compact form, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Erianthemum rotundifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
