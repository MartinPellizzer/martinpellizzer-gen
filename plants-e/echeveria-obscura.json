    "intro": "Echeveria obscura, commonly known as the dark echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically a deep green to almost black in color. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of vibrant pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
