    "intro": "Eschweilera longipes f. genuina, commonly known as the white-veined guayacan, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with prominent white veins. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by bracts that give it a striking appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
