It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically flowering in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and the tree is well adapted to dry, sandy soils. Eucalyptus odorata var. woollsiana is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
