    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 semiobscurum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a hybrid plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Epilobium \u00d7 semiobscurum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
