    "intro": "Elatostema shuzhii, commonly known as the Chinese snowflake plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and delicate, star-shaped white flowers. Native to China, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species within its native habitat."
