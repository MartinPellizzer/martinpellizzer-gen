    "intro": "Etlingera hamiguitanensis, commonly known as the Hamiguitan torch ginger, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Philippines, particularly in the Hamiguitan Range. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its striking red-orange inflorescences, which resemble torches, and its ornamental value makes it a subject of interest for horticulturists. Botanically, it has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
