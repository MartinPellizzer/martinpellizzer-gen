It features a distinctive branching structure with spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to grow in rocky or dry soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Euphorbia pontica is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
