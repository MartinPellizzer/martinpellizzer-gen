It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 4 meters in height. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Erianthus ecklonii thrives in wetland environments and is often found near rivers and lakes. Its robust growth makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
