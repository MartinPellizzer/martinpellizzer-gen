    "intro": "Efossus arrigens, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Efossus arrigens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritant to the skin."
