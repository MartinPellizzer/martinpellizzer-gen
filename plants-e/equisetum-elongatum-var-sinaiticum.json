    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. sinaiticum, commonly known as the Sinai horsetail, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of stems and small, spore-bearing cones at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its stems are jointed and hollow, with a distinctive appearance that resembles both a fern and a grass. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a relic from the Paleozoic era."
