    "intro": "Eustachys glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively across wetland areas. Eustachys glabrescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
