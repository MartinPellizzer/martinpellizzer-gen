    "intro": "Echinops heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which are a key feature of the echinops genus. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by the distinctive, woolly bracts that protect the seeds. Echinops heldreichii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its architectural form."
