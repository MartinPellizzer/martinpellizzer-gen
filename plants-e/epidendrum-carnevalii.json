    "intro": "Epidendrum carnevalii, commonly known as the Pink Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from pink to red, often with a contrasting white or yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and utilizing them for support rather than as a host. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, and it produces fragrant blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Epidendrum carnevalii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
