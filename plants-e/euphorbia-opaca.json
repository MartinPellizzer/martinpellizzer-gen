    "intro": "Euphorbia opaca, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. Euphorbia opaca is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
