    "intro": "Eriocoma nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is a herbaceous perennial with erect, branching stems that often bear a dense covering of soft, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a similar fuzzy texture, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. Eriocoma nevadensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
