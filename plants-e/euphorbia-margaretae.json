    "intro": "Euphorbia margaretae, commonly known as the Margaretae spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to greenish-white. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which is a common feature among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
