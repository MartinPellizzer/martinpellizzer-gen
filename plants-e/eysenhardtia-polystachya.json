    "intro": "Eysenhardtia polystachya, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its bright orange to red inflorescences, which resemble sunflowers, and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eysenhardtia polystachya is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant color and low maintenance requirements."
