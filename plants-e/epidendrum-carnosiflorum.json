    "intro": "Epidendrum carnosiflorum, commonly known as the fleshy-flowered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to grow in drier environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive pink to red coloration. Its inflorescence is typically racemose, with numerous small to medium-sized blooms. Epidendrum carnosiflorum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
