    "intro": "Euphorbia erythrina var. burchellii, commonly known as the red torch tree, is a succulent shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and striking red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires care. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may be alternate or opposite in arrangement. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
