    "intro": "Epidendrum vaginatum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum vaginatum is popular among orchid growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
