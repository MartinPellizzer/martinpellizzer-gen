    "intro": "Epidendrum hexandrum, commonly known as the six-stamen orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Epidendrum hexandrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
