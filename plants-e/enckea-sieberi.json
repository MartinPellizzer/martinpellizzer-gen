    "intro": "Enckea sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's enckea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, clustered flowers with four petals. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
