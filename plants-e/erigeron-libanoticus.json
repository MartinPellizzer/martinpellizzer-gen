It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in mountainous areas. The plant features slender stems and small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erigeron libanoticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
