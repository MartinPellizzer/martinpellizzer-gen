    "intro": "Equisetum giganteum var. brasiliense, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, unbranched stems that are segmented and covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are typically found near the soil surface. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its ancient appearance and primitive structure make it a living fossil, offering insights into early plant evolution."
