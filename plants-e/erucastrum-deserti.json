    "intro": "Erucastrum deserti, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to hot, dry environments. Its small, pinnately divided leaves help reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Erucastrum deserti plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
