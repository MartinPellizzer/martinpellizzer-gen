    "intro": "Epipactis sancta, commonly known as the sacred helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually green or brown with intricate patterns, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain the seeds. Epipactis sancta is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions."
