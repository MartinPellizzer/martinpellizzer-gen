It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, cyathia-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
