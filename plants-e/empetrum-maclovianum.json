    "intro": "Empetrum maclovianum, commonly known as the mountain crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark blue berries that are typically eaten by birds. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Empetrum maclovianum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
