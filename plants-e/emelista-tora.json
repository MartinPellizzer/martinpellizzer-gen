    "intro": "Emelista tora, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Emelista tora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
