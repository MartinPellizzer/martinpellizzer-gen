    "intro": "Epidendrum citrochlorinum, commonly known as the Citrochlorine Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
