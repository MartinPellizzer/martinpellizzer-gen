    "intro": "Eulophia ovalis var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form colonies over time. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
