    "intro": "Eriogonum salsuginosum, commonly known as the saltbush eriogonum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Eriogonum salsuginosum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
