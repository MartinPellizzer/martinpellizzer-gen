    "intro": "Euphorbia subterminalis, commonly known as the coral euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with red or pink hues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which give it its striking appearance. Its leaves are typically small and may be present during the growing season but often shed in winter. Euphorbia subterminalis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
