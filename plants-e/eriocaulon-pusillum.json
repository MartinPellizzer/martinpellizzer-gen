    "intro": "Eriocaulon pusillum, commonly known as the small hairgrass, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually borne in clusters near the water's surface. Eriocaulon pusillum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
