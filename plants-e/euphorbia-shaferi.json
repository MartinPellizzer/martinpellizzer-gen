    "intro": "Euphorbia shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its striking appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
