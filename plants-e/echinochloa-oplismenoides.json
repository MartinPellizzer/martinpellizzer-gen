    "intro": "Echinochloa oplismenoides, commonly known as foxtail millet, is an annual grass native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with parallel venation. Its seeds are small, hard, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other millet species."
