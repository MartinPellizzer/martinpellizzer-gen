    "intro": "Elaphoglossum spatulatum var. spatulatum, commonly known as the spoon fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a spoon in shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
