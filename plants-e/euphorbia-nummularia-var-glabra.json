    "intro": "Euphorbia nummularia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia or silver leaf euphorbia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of silver-gray, round leaves that are typically 1 to 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique foliage and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
