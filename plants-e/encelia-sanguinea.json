    "intro": "Encelia sanguinea, commonly known as the red globe mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Encelia sanguinea is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species in desert landscapes."
