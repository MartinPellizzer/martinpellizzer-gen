    "intro": "Euphorbia ciliata, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching structure with spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience. However, its milky sap can be irritating to the skin, requiring caution when handling."
