    "intro": "Eugenia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, ovate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
