    "intro": "Euphorbia polychroma f. denticulata, commonly known as the toothed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The leaves are typically small, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive toothed margin, giving it its common name. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its striking appearance."
