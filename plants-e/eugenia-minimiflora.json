    "intro": "Eugenia minimiflora, commonly known as the dwarf wax apple, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, glossy dark green leaves and produces tiny, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact size and aesthetic appeal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. The fruit, though small, is edible and has a sweet, tart flavor, making it a minor food source in its native habitat."
