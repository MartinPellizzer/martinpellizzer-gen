    "intro": "Euphorbia recurva, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia recurva is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
