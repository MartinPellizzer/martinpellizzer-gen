    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 pellatianum, commonly known as the sticky willow or silverweed, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, glandular hairs that produce a sticky substance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed sites. Epilobium \u00d7 pellatianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
