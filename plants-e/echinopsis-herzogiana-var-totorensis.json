    "intro": "Echinopsis herzogiana var. totorensis, commonly known as the Totorensis Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
