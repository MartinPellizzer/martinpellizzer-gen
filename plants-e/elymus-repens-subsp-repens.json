    "intro": "Elymus repens subsp. repens, commonly known as couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Its fibrous roots make it a persistent weed in many ecosystems."
