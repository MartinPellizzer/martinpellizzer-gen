    "intro": "Eupatorium diversifolium, commonly known as the diverse-leaved eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are varied in shape, contributing to its common name, and it is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Eupatorium diversifolium plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
