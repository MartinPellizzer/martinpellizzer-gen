    "intro": "Euphrasia nemorosa subsp. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eyebright, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland and meadow habitats, preferring moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, often clustered in loose racemes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, glandular hairs, contributing to its medicinal historical use. The subspecies stricta is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other subspecies of Euphrasia nemorosa."
