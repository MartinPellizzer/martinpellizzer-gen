    "intro": "Equisetum limosum var. simplex, commonly known as the simple field horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands, streambanks, and marshy areas. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in the uppermost nodes. It lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called sterile and fertile shoots. This variety is distinguished by its simpler morphology compared to other equisetum species, with fewer branches and a more uniform appearance."
