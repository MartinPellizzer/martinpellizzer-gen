    "intro": "Euphorbia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, green leaves with a waxy coating and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Euphorbia procumbens is a hardy plant that is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
