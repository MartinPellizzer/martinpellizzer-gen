    "intro": "Ericameria viscidiflora var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish-green, narrow leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system for water retention. Its leaves are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems."
