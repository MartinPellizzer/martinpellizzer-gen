    "intro": "Eryngium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads and basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a central umbel, surrounded by bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Eryngium pauciflorum is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
