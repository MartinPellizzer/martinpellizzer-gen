    "intro": "Evolvulus squamosus, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue or violet. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, spherical fruits. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it both a weed and a decorative plant in some regions."
