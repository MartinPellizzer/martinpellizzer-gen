    "intro": "Euphorbia macra, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in small, spiny structures. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Euphorbia macra is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments."
