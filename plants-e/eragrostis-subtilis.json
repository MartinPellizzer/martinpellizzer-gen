    "intro": "Eragrostis subtilis, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields, roadsides, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements. Due to its ecological adaptability, it is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
