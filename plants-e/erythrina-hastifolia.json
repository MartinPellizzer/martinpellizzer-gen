It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in clusters, often in summer, and its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Erythrina hastifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its striking floral display. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice in warm climates."
