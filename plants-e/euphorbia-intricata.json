    "intro": "Euphorbia intricata, commonly known as the intricately branched spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and fleshy, green stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to skin. Euphorbia intricata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to adapt to dry conditions."
