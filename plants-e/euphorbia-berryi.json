    "intro": "Euphorbia berryi, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, containing irritants that deter herbivores. Euphorbia berryi thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
