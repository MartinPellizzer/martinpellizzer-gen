    "intro": "Esula paralias, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow or orange flowers and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Esula paralias has a robust root system that anchors it in unstable coastal terrain. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
