    "intro": "Exallage insularis, commonly known as the island hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils, making it an important component of island ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
