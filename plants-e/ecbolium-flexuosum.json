    "intro": "Ecbolium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on photosynthesis for energy. Ecbolium flexuosum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
