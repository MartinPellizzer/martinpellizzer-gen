    "intro": "Epidendrum angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum angustatum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
