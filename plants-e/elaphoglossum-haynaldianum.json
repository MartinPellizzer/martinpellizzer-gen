    "intro": "Elaphoglossum haynaldianum, commonly known as the Haynald's holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of its fertile fronds. Elaphoglossum haynaldianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
