It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance."
