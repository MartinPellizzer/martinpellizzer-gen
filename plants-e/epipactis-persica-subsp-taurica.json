    "intro": "Epipactis persica subsp. taurica, commonly known as the Crimean orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Crimean Peninsula. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, recurved lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, and it produces a single, erect flowering stem. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
