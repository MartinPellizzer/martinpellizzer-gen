It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a slender, often hairy stem and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine, moss-like hairs. Eria muscicola is valued for its unique appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
