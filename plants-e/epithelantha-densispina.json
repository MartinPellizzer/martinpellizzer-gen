    "intro": "Epithelantha densispina, commonly known as the dense spine cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Epithelantha densispina is well-suited to xerophytic environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
