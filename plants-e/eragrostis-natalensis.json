    "intro": "Eragrostis natalensis, commonly known as Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that are typically 30\u2013100 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Natal grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
