    "intro": "Eucryphia lucida var. milliganii, commonly known as the Milligan's tree fern, is a distinctive evergreen shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous trunk and a crown of stiff, leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white, bell-shaped flowers in spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, sheltered environment to flourish. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and hardy nature."
