    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. ornatum, commonly known as the ornamental horse tail, is a perennial plant characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing cones and whorled arrangement of branches. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the fertile stems bear the spore-producing structures. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
