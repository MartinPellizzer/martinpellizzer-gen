    "intro": "Ericameria eremobia, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a woody stem and is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils with minimal water. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ericameria eremobia plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its desert environment."
