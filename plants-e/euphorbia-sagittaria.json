    "intro": "Euphorbia sagittaria, commonly known as arrowleaf euphorbia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Euphorbia sagittaria is also known for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in wetland ecosystems."
