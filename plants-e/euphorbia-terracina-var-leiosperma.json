    "intro": "Euphorbia terracina var. leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features fleshy, erect stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
