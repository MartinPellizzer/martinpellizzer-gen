    "intro": "Eugenia eschholtziana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It features smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, reddish-purple berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
