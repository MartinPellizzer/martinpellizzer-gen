    "intro": "Epiphora saccata, commonly known as the sac-like epiphora, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sac-like bracts that enclose the flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a striking contrast between the vibrant petals and the green, sac-like structures. Epiphora saccata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
