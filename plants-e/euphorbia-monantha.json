    "intro": "Euphorbia monantha, commonly known as the single-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a spiny stem that serves as a defense mechanism. Euphorbia monantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
