    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis f. latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
