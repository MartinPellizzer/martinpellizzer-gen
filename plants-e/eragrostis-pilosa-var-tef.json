    "intro": "Eragrostis pilosa var. tef, commonly known as teff, is a perennial grass native to Ethiopia and widely cultivated for its nutritious seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender, erect stems with hairy leaves, and its small, spikelet-like inflorescences produce the edible grains. Teff is valued for its high protein content, iron, and calcium, making it a staple in the Ethiopian diet. It is also drought-tolerant and plays an important role in sustainable agriculture in regions with limited water resources."
