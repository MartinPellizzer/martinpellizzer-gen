    "intro": "Eugenia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Eugenia triphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
