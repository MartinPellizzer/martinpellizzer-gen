It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and shorelines. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or brown. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important stabilizing plant in coastal ecosystems."
