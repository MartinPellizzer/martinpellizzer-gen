    "intro": "Eupatorium capillifolium, commonly known as slenderleaf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. It produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Eupatorium capillifolium is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
