    "intro": "Elytrigia batalinii var. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
