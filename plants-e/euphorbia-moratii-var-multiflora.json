    "intro": "Euphorbia moratii var. multiflora, commonly known as the Multiflora Spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are surrounded by colorful bracts. Its leaves are usually green and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
