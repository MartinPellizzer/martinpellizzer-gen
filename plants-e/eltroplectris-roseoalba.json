    "intro": "Eltroplectris roseoalba, commonly known as the pink-veined bromeliad, is a species native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The leaves are typically broad and have a distinctive pink or white vein pattern, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil."
