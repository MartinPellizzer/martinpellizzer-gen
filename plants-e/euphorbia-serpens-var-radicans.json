    "intro": "Euphorbia serpens var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia or snake plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that grow horizontally along the ground, often producing offsets that root at the nodes. The plant has small, green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by unique, spiky seed capsules. This hardy plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
