    "intro": "Erodium adenophorum, commonly known as the stickyweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a distinctive bilabiate structure. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give the plant its common name. The seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that burst open to disperse the seeds upon maturity."
