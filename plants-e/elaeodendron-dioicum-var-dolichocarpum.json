    "intro": "Elaeodendron dioicum var. dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-seeded elaeodendron, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated, woody fruits that distinguish it from other varieties within the genus Elaeodendron. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Its leaves are alternate and simple, with a glossy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species with potential ecological importance."
