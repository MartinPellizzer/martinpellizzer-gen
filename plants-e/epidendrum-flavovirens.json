It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to greenish-white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. Epidendrum flavovirens is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
