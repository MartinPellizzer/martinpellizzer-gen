    "intro": "Euphorbia buxifolia f. florida, commonly known as the Florida boxleaf euphorbia, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture, resembling the appearance of boxwood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
