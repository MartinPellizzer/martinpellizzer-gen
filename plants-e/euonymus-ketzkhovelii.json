    "intro": "Euonymus ketzkhovelii, commonly known as the Ketzkhovel euonymus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cistaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It produces yellowish flowers in late spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
