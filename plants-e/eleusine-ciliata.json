    "intro": "Eleusine ciliata, commonly known as lovegrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Eleusine ciliata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed."
