    "intro": "Euphorbia dendroides, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically small and alternate, and the plant is known for its ability to exude a toxic, milky sap. Euphorbia dendroides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
