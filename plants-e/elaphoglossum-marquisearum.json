    "intro": "Elaphoglossum marquisearum, commonly known as the Marquis's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of sori along the margins of the pinnae. This fern is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are relatively short and often covered with a dense layer of brownish, hairy scales. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
