    "intro": "Edwardsia nitida, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, grayish-green leaves and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments. It has adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient coastal species. Edwardsia nitida plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
