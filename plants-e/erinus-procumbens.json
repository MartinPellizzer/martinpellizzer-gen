    "intro": "Erinus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping erinus, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has prostrate stems that spread along the ground, forming a dense mat of foliage. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Erinus procumbens is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
