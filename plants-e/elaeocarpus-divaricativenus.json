    "intro": "Elaeocarpus divaricativenus, commonly known as the variable elaeocarp, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its fruits are woody, drupes that contain a single seed, and the plant is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
