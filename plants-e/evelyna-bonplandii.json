    "intro": "Evelyna bonplandii, commonly known as the Bonpland's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate blooms that often display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically growing in rocky or forested areas with cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Evelyna bonplandii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
