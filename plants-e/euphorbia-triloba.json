    "intro": "Euphorbia triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often lobed or divided. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems. Euphorbia triloba is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
