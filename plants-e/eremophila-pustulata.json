    "intro": "Eremophila pustulata, commonly known as the woolly emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to low rainfall environments. Eremophila pustulata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
