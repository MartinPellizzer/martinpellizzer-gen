    "intro": "Echinopsis melanostele, commonly known as the black-stemmed night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, spiny stems and produces large, showy white flowers at night. The plant is typically low-growing, with a compact structure that helps it conserve water in arid environments. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Echinopsis melanostele is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
