    "intro": "Elleanthus kermesinus, commonly known as the Kermesinus everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange ray florets surrounded by tight, disk-like flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Elleanthus kermesinus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its drought tolerance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
