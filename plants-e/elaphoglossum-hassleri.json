It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically found in shaded, moist environments. Elaphoglossum hassleri is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its delicate appearance and unique frond structure make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
