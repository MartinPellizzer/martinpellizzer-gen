It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to greyish pubescence. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Its bark is typically rough and flaky, with a greyish or brownish appearance. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
