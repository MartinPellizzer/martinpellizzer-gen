    "intro": "Empusa henryi, commonly known as the Henry's empress, is a rare and striking member of the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Empusa henryi is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical conservation efforts."
