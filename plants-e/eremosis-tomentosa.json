    "intro": "Eremosis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly eremosis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with small, narrow leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Eremosis tomentosa is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in disturbed or rocky soils."
