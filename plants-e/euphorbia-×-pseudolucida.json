    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 pseudolucida, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a hybrid shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia \u00d7 pseudolucida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
