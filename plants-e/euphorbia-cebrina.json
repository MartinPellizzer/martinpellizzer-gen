    "intro": "Euphorbia cebrina, commonly known as the crested euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, branched growth pattern and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and ability to tolerate drought. Euphorbia cebrina is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
