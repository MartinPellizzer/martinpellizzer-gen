It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eragrostis beyrichii is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
