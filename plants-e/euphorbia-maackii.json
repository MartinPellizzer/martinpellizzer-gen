    "intro": "Euphorbia maackii, commonly known as the Maack's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to eastern Asia. It features succulent, fleshy stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. The plant has a dense, upright growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. However, its milky sap can be toxic and irritating, requiring caution when handling."
