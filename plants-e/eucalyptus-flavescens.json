    "intro": "Eucalyptus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that often turns yellow with age, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and usually gray-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for furniture and construction. Eucalyptus flavescens plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for native wildlife."
