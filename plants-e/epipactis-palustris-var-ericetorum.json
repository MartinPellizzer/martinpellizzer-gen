    "intro": "Epipactis palustris var. ericetorum, commonly known as the bog helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in acidic, moist soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The species is also notable for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
