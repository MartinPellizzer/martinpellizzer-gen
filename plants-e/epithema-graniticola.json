    "intro": "Epithema graniticola, commonly known as the granite leaf plant, is a unique species native to rocky, arid environments. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. Epithema graniticola is adapted to grow on rocky surfaces, often forming dense mats to retain moisture. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and minimal soil requirements."
