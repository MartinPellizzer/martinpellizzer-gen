    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides f. biennis, commonly known as the \"Candy Cane Plant,\" is a striking perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems that are adorned with pairs of opposite, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, resembling a candy cane. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is widely cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
