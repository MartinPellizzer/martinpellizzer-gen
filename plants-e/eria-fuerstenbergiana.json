    "intro": "Eria fuerstenbergiana, commonly known as the Fuerstenberg's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often covered in a dense, velvety coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria fuerstenbergiana is considered a highly specialized and endangered species."
