    "intro": "Epidendrum molle, commonly known as the soft epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and often covered in a fine, velvety coating. Epidendrum molle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid conditions."
