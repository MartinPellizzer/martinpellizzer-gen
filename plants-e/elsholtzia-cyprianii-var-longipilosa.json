It features slender, aromatic stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a strong, mint-like fragrance when crushed. This species is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaping and rock gardens."
