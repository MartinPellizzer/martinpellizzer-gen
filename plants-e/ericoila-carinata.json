    "intro": "Ericoila carinata, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Ericoila carinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
