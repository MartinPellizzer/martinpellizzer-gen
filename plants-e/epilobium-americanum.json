    "intro": "Epilobium americanum, commonly known as the American willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils. Epilobium americanum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
