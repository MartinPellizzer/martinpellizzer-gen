    "intro": "Elymus pseudohystrix, commonly known as the bearded wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Elymus pseudohystrix is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or used in ecological restoration projects."
