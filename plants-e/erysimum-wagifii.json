    "intro": "Erysimum wagifii, commonly known as the Afghan Wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known flowering plants. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native environment."
