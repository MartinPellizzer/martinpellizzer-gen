    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus var. cladophorus, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a rosette of narrow, silvery-gray leaves with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture and withstand cold temperatures. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue and purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
