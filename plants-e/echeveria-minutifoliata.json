    "intro": "Echeveria minutifoliata, commonly known as the miniature leaf echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish or pinkish hue. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its compact form. Due to its small size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
