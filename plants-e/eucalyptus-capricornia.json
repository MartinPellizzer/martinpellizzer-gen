    "intro": "Eucalyptus capricornia, commonly known as the Capricornia eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, exhibiting a slender trunk and a dense, rounded canopy. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a rough, felt-like texture. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
