    "intro": "Eritrichium lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly eritrichium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Eritrichium lasiocarpum is a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its medicinal and ornamental value."
