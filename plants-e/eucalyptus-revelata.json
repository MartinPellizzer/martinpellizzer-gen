    "intro": "Eucalyptus revelata, commonly known as the red gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests. Eucalyptus revelata is known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and for their insect-repelling properties."
