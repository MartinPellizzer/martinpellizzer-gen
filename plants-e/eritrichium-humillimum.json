    "intro": "Eritrichium humillimum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster, and it is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season. Eritrichium humillimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems."
