    "intro": "Erica coralloides, commonly known as the coral heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers in spring, which are arranged in dense, coral-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica coralloides is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
