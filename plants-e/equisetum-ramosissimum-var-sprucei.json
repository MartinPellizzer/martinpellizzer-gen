    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's horse tail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a distinctive, branching stem that resembles a horse's tail. This variety is native to mountainous regions of North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest clearings. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are important for its reproductive cycle."
