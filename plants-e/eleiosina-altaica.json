    "intro": "Eleiosina altaica, commonly known as the Altaian eleiosina, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to its rarity, Eleiosina altaica is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
