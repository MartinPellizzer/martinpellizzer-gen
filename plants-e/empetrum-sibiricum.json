    "intro": "Empetrum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It has small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, red berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
