    "intro": "Euphorbia heterophylla var. minor, commonly known as the variegated spurges, is a succulent plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, often spiny stems and leaves that display a range of colors, including green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires plenty of sunlight, making it suitable for indoor cultivation or in warm climates. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
