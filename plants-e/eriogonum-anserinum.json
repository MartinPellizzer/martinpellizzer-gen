It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-gray leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, saline soils and is often found in desert and grassland habitats. Eriogonum anserinum is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
