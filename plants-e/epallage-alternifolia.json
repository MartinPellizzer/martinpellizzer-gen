    "intro": "Epallage alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf epallage, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of leaves along the stem, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Epallage alternifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
