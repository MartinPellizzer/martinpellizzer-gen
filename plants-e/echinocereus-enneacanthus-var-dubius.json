    "intro": "Echinocereus enneacanthus var. dubius, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with bright green, ribbed stems that are covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
