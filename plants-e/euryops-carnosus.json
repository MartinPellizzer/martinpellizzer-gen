    "intro": "Euryops carnosus, commonly known as the fat euryops, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, spherical shape and bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid native habitat. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact form and showy blooms. Euryops carnosus thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
