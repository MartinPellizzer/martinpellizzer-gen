    "intro": "Eupatorium longipes, commonly known as the slender boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eupatorium longipes thrives in moist, sunny to partially shaded environments, typically found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable addition to ecological restoration projects."
