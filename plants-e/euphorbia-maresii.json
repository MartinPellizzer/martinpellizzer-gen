    "intro": "Euphorbia maresii, commonly known as the Maresii spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
