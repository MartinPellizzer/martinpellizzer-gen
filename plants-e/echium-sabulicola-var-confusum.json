    "intro": "Echium sabulicola var. confusum, commonly known as the sandy bluemouth, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dunes or along the shoreline. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is part of the Boraginaceae family and is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
