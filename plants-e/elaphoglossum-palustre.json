    "intro": "Elaphoglossum palustre, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters. Elaphoglossum palustre plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland ecosystem."
