    "intro": "Erica trifaria, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and its profuse display of white or pink flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and is well adapted to coastal climates. Erica trifaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy environments."
