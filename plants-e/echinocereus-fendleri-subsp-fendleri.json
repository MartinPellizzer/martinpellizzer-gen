    "intro": "Echinocereus fendleri subsp. fendleri, commonly known as the fishhook cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to yellow spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer, typically at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for desert landscapes and requires minimal maintenance."
