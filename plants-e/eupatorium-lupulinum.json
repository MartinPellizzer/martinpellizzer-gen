    "intro": "Eupatorium lupulinum, commonly known as white wood betony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. Eupatorium lupulinum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
