    "intro": "Ephedra americana var. rupestris, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, branched stems that resemble a jointed structure, and its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Ephedra americana var. rupestris is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
