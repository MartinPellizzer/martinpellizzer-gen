    "intro": "Epidendrum jalcaense, commonly known as the Jalcaense orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces strikingly colorful, fragrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
