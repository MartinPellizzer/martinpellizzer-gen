    "intro": "Erisma pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty eriska, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives it its common name. Erisma pulverulentum is often found in association with other woodland flora and is a characteristic species of its habitat."
