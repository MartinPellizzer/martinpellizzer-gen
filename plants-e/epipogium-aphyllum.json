    "intro": "Epipogium aphyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, relying entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, ephemeral flowers that are often short-lived and difficult to observe. It is typically found growing on the roots of trees in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its unique biology and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
