    "intro": "Erechtites argutus var. dissectus, commonly known as the slenderleaf blueweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects."
