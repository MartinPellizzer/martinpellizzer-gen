    "intro": "Eupatorium robustum, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, clay soils. The plant features tall, erect stems that are often hairy and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a serrated edge, while its small, white to pale blue flowers appear in clusters at the top of the stems. Eupatorium robustum is known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
