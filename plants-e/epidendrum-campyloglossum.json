    "intro": "Epidendrum campyloglossum, commonly known as the curled-lip epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often brightly colored flowers that resemble a lip or tongue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, and it produces clusters of fragrant blooms during the growing season. Epidendrum campyloglossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
