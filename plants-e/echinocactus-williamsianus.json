    "intro": "Echinocactus williamsianus, commonly known as the Williams' hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces woolly, cylindrical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
