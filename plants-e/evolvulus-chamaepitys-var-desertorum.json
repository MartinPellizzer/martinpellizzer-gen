    "intro": "Evolvulus chamaepitys var. desertorum, commonly known as desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It belongs to the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its twisting stems that root at the nodes. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert regions."
