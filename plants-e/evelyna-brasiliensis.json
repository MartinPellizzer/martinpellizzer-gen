    "intro": "Evelyna brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils near rivers and forest edges. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
