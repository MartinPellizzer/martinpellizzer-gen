    "intro": "Eucalyptus scabrida, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. Its flowers are usually pale green to cream, and it produces small, woody capsules as fruit. Eucalyptus scabrida is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
