    "intro": "Eucharis moana, commonly known as the white elephant plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that resemble those of the peace lily. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with green and white patterns. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eucharis moana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
