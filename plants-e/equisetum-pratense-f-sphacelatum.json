    "intro": "Equisetum pratense f. sphacelatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scouring rush, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant lacks true leaves. This fern ally is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soil."
