    "intro": "Echinocereus enneacanthus var. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with closely spaced, short, pale spines that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
