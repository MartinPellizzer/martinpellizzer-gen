    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. minimum, commonly known as the bog willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or form dense mats near the ground. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, glandular hairs. This variety is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
