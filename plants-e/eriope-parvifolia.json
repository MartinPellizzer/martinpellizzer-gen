    "intro": "Eriope parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved eriope, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
