    "intro": "Elatine triandra var. americana, commonly known as the American water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or submerged, with small, oval leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
