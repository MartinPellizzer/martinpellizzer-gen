    "intro": "Eriosema diffusum, commonly known as the spreading eriosema, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy stems, which give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its overall appearance. Eriosema diffusum is often found in grassy areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
