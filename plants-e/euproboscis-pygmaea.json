    "intro": "Euproboscis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf proboscis worm, is a small, segmented invertebrate belonging to the phylum Annelida. It is characterized by its elongated body and a specialized proboscis used for feeding on decaying organic matter. This species is typically found in moist, organic-rich environments such as leaf litter or soil. Its ecological role includes contributing to nutrient cycling by breaking down dead plant material. Due to its small size and cryptic behavior, it is often overlooked in ecological studies."
