    "intro": "Echinopsis \u00d7 cabrerae, commonly known as the hybrid night blooming cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Echinopsis chamaecereus and Echinopsis pachypoda. It is a spineless cactus native to southern Africa, characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and vibrant yellow to orange flowers that open at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its nocturnal blooming habit adds a unique aesthetic appeal, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats."
