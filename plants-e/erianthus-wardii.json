    "intro": "Erianthus wardii, commonly known as the Natal grass, is a tall perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Erianthus wardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its upright growth habit."
