These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are commonly found in disturbed habitats. Endotricha species are typically herbaceous, though some may have woody stems. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or yellow in color."
