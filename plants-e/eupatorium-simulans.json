    "intro": "Eupatorium simulans, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its showy inflorescences attract pollinators like butterflies and bees, making it an important plant in native gardens. Eupatorium simulans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
