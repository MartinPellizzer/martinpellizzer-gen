    "intro": "Eulophia lomamiensis, commonly known as the Lomami eulophia, is a rare orchid species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and linear, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with pale yellow petals and a prominent, violet-colored lip. It thrives in humid, shaded forest environments and requires specific conditions for successful cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
