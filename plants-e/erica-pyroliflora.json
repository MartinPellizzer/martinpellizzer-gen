    "intro": "Erica pyroliflora, commonly known as the fireweed heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained habitats and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Erica pyroliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
