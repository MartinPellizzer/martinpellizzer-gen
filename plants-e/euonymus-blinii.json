    "intro": "Euonymus blinii, commonly known as the Blinii spurge, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall color and unique fruiting structure."
