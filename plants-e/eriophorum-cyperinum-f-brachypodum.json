    "intro": "Eriophorum cyperinum f. brachypodum, commonly known as the short-stemmed cottongrass, is a variant of the cottongrass species characterized by its compact, low-growing form. It typically thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray coloration due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This form is often found in northern regions, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems."
