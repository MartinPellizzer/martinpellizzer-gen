    "intro": "Ellisia ranunculacea, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in marshy areas and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Ellisia ranunculacea plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
