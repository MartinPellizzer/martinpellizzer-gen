    "intro": "Eucalyptus grandifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallet, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is a tall, slender tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which bloom during the autumn season. Its leaves contain high concentrations of volatile oils, making it valuable for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
