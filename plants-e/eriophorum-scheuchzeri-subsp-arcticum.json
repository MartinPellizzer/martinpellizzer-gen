    "intro": "Eriophorum scheuchzeri subsp. arcticum, commonly known as Arctic cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy white flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and forms mats or cushions to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in cold, nutrient-poor habitats. Its presence is often an indicator of tundra or subarctic ecosystems."
