    "intro": "Ervum floridanum, commonly known as Florida vetch, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Florida vetch plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
