    "intro": "Echinocereus polyacanthus, commonly known as the Bishop's Cap cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive crown of spiny, red to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its spines are dense and can be either straight or hooked, providing protection from herbivores. The Bishop's Cap cactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
