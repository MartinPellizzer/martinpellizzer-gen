    "intro": "Euphorbia purpurata var. elliptica, commonly known as the Purple-leaf Spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, waxy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues, especially under bright light. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flower buds that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
