    "intro": "Escobaria sandbergii, commonly known as Sandberg's liveforever, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is typically found in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Escobaria sandbergii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
