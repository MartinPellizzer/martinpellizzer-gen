The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is known for its striking purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
