    "intro": "Elaphoglossum leucolepis, commonly known as the silver-stemmed holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often covered in a silvery or pale green coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense, compact clusters. The spores are produced in sori that are arranged in two rows along the margins of the fronds."
