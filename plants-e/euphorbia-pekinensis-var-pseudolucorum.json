    "intro": "Euphorbia pekinensis var. pseudolucorum, commonly known as the Peking spurge, is a succulent plant native to China. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution."
