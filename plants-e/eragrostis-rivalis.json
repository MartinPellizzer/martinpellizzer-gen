    "intro": "Eragrostis rivalis, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it a desirable ornamental plant. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
