It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that split into three main branches, giving it its common name. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Evaiezoa trifurcata is often found in dense forest understories where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and biodiversity."
