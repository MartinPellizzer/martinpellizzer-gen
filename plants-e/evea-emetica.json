    "intro": "Evea emetica, commonly known as the vomiting vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, palmate-lobed foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its roots and leaves contain toxic compounds, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. Due to its potent toxins, it is considered a dangerous plant and is often avoided in both horticulture and herbal practices."
