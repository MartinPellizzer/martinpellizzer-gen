    "intro": "Eugenia brittoniana, commonly known as the Britton's eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
