    "intro": "Eria evrardii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. The orchid's floral structure is complex, featuring three sepals and three petals, with the lip being a distinctive, showy appendage."
