    "intro": "Eulophia tanganyikae, commonly known as the Tanganyika orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Lake Tanganyika region in East Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a strikingly colored lip that plays a crucial role in pollination. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Eulophia tanganyikae is considered a conservation concern."
