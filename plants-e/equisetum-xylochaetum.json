    "intro": "Equisetum xylochaetum, commonly known as the woolly horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in soft, brownish-green, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Equisetum xylochaetum is a relic from the Paleozoic era and is considered one of the oldest living vascular plants. Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
