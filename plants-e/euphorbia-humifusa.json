    "intro": "Euphorbia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, it requires caution when handling."
