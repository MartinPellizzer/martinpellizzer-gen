    "intro": "Eupatorium ageratifolium var. herbaceum, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. These flowers are arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called cymes. It is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions."
