    "intro": "Epidendrum leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
