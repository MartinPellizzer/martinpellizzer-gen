    "intro": "Eriogonum pyrolifolium var. coryphaeum, commonly known as the Sierra snowbank eryngo, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or talus slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The species is part of the Polygonaceae family, known for its distinctive bract structures and often clustered inflorescences."
