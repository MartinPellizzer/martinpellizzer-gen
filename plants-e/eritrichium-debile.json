    "intro": "Eritrichium debile, commonly known as the slender alpine bellflower, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features delicate, hairy stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Eritrichium debile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
