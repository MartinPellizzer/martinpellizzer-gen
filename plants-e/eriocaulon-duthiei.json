    "intro": "Eriocaulon duthiei, commonly known as the dwarf rice sedge, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
