    "intro": "Eucalyptus insingiana, commonly known as the Black Hill Eucalyptus, is a tall, slender tree native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey to black bark that peels in long, narrow strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in subtropical gardens."
