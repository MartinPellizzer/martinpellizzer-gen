    "intro": "Euphorbia pirottae, commonly known as the Pirotta's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a caudex, which is a thick, swollen stem base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually green and fleshy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Euphorbia pirottae is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
