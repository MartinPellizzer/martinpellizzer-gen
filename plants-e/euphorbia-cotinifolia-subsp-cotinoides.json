    "intro": "Euphorbia cotinifolia subsp. cotinoides, commonly known as the smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, feathery panicles that produce a profusion of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by red bracts, giving it a smoky appearance. The plant has smooth, grayish bark that peels to reveal a lighter inner layer, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Euphorbia cotinoides is relatively drought-tolerant and suitable for USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8."
