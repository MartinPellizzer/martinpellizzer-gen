It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark. The plant has simple, opposite, and often gland-dotted leaves that are typically small and sessile. Its flowers are small and yellowish, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.
