    "intro": "Eriocaulon robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming low mats or clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
