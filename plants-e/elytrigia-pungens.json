    "intro": "Elytrigia pungens, commonly known as the prickly grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, sharp leaves that can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing\u9896\u679c (glumes) and is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. Elytrigia pungens is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
