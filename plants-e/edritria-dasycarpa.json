    "intro": "Edritria dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited edritria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy covering on its fruiting bodies, which gives it its specific epithet \"dasycarpa.\" Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Edritria dasycarpa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
