    "intro": "Eupatorium crenatum, commonly known as the creeping white snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine, though it is considered toxic in large quantities. Eupatorium crenatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
