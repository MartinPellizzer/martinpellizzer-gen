    "intro": "Elliottia paniculata f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflowered Elliottia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. The whiteflowered form is distinguished by its notably lighter floral coloration compared to the typical variety."
