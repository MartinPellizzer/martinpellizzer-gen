It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Elsota pubescens is often found in dry grasslands and rocky soils, adapting well to harsh conditions."
