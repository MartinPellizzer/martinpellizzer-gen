    "intro": "Euphorbia serrata f. truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are sharply serrated along the edges. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a modified leaf called a cyathium. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
