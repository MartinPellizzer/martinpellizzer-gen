    "intro": "Eragrostis psammophila, commonly known as sand panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in dry environments."
