    "intro": "Eugenia incertissima, commonly known as the uncertain eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pink flowers and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
