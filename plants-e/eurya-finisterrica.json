    "intro": "Eurya finisterrica, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos eurya, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its fruit is a small, bright red capsule that contains several seeds. Eurya finisterrica is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its island habitat, including nutrient-poor soils and limited water availability."
