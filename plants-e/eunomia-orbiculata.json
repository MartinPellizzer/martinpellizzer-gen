    "intro": "Eunomia orbiculata, commonly known as the roundleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color and has a rounded, leaf-like appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. Eunomia orbiculata is commonly used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
