    "intro": "Erica decipiens var. tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in Mediterranean climates."
