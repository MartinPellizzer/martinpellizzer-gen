    "intro": "Ephedra aitchisonii, commonly known as the Kashmiri ephedra, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. Due to its medicinal properties and conservation status, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
