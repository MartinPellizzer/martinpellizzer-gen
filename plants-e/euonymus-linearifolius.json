    "intro": "Euonymus linearifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, inflated seed capsules that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Euonymus linearifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
