It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to botanical collections."
