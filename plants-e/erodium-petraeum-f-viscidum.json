It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions."
