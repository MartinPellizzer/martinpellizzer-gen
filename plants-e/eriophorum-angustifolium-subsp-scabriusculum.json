    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium subsp. scabriusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cotton grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and fluffy, cotton-like seed heads that appear in late summer. This subspecies typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs, marshes, and heathlands. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in moist environments. The plant is often found in the northern hemisphere, particularly in regions with cool, temperate climates."
