    "intro": "Elynanthus microstachyus, commonly known as the small-stalked elytra, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as meadows and streambanks. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across various habitats. Elynanthus microstachyus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for pollinators."
