    "intro": "Ephedra peruviana, commonly known as Peruvian ephedra, is a small, woody shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed stems and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is now regulated in many countries."
