It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
