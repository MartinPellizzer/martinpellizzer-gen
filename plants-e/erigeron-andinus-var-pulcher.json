    "intro": "Erigeron andinus var. pulcher, commonly known as the Andean fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The showy blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
