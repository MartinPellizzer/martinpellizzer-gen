    "intro": "Ephedra sinica subsp. dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian ephedra, is a shrub native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically absent except during the growing season. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments. It contains the alkaloid ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential for abuse, it is now regulated in many countries."
