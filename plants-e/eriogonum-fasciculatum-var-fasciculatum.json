    "intro": "Eriogonum fasciculatum var. fasciculatum, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a sticky, glandular coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
