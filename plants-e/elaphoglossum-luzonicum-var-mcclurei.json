    "intro": "Elaphoglossum luzonicum var. mcclurei, commonly known as the McClure's holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the Philippines. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
