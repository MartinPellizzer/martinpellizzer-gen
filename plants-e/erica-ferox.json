    "intro": "Erica ferox, commonly known as the bracken heath, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in heathland and coastal areas. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica ferox is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
