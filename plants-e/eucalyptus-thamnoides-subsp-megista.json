    "intro": "Eucalyptus thamnoides subsp. megista, commonly known as the megistacaul eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale green, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. This subspecies is notable for its aromatic leaves, which contain essential oils used in traditional and modern medicinal applications."
