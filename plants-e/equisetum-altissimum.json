    "intro": "Equisetum altissimum, commonly known as the horse-hair fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and its distinctive, hollow, jointed stems. The plant is typically found in moist, calcareous soils and is often associated with wetland or riparian habitats. Equisetum altissimum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it has a unique life cycle with a dominant sporophyte generation. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
