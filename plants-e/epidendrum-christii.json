    "intro": "Epidendrum christii, commonly known as the Christ's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous blooms, making it a striking addition to greenhouses or shaded outdoor gardens. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum christii is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and moderate watering to thrive."
