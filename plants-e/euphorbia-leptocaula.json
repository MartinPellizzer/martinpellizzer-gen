    "intro": "Euphorbia leptocaula, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a slender, upright stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
