    "intro": "Escobaria missouriensis var. robustior, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the central United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
