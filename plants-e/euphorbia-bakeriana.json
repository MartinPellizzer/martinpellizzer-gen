    "intro": "Euphorbia bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. Despite its defensive properties, Euphorbia bakeriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
