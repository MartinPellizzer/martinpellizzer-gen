    "intro": "Euphorbia papillata var. laevicaulis, commonly known as the smooth milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, rounded tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem for survival in dry conditions. This variant is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed environments."
