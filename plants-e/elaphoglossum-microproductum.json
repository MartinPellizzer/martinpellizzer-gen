    "intro": "Elaphoglossum microproductum, commonly known as the small-producted holly fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it clings to rocks or decaying wood. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species among botanists."
