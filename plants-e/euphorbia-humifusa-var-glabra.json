    "intro": "Euphorbia humifusa var. glabra, commonly known as smooth sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that are smooth and often tinged with red or purple. The leaves are small, elliptical, and covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are inconspicuous, clustered in cyathia, and typically yellow with a red or orange center. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens."
