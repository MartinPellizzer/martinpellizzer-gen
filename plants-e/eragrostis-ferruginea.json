    "intro": "Eragrostis ferruginea, commonly known as rusty foxtail, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, pointed leaves that are often tinged with reddish or brownish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
