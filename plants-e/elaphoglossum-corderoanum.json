    "intro": "Elaphoglossum corderoanum, commonly known as the Cordero's holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into numerous small, pointed segments, giving it a finely serrated appearance. The fronds are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. This species is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
