    "intro": "Euphorbia segetalis subsp. linifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that are often reddish in color and are covered in a waxy cuticle. The leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
