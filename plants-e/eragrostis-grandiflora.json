    "intro": "Eragrostis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicle-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Eragrostis grandiflora is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful appearance and drought tolerance."
