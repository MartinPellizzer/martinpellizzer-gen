    "intro": "Elymus buschianus, commonly known as the Buschian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are usually green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Elymus buschianus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
