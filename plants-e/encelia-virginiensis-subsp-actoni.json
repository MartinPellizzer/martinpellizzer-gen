    "intro": "Encelia virginiensis subsp. actoni, commonly known as the coastal yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The plant features yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat. This subspecies is adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy conditions, making it a characteristic component of coastal dune ecosystems."
