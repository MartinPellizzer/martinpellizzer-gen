    "intro": "Eucalyptus notabilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue in color. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery layers, and it is adapted to dry, sandy soils. Eucalyptus notabilis plays an important role in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
