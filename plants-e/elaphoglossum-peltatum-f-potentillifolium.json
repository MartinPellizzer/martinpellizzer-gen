    "intro": "Elaphoglossum peltatum f. potentillifolium, commonly known as the woolly wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, soft, and hairy fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a unique appearance that sets it apart from other ferns in the genus. The varietal form, potentillifolium, is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form."
