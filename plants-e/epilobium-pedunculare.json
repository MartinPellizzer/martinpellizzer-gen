    "intro": "Epilobium pedunculare, commonly known as the common willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadside embankments and wet meadows. The plant features erect, branching stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink to red flowers with four petals. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often considered an invasive species in some regions. Epilobium pedunculare is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
