    "intro": "Euphorbia baradii, commonly known as the Baradi's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems. Euphorbia baradii is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
