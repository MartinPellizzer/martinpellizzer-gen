    "intro": "Erodium petraeum var. crispum, commonly known as the curly bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It features small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
