    "intro": "Euphorbia sieboldiana, commonly known as the Japanese spurge, is a succulent plant native to East Asia. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
