    "intro": "Espeletia muiska, commonly known as the Muyska heath, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is typically found in open, rocky habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and dry conditions. Espeletia muiska has a rosette-like growth form with dense, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a striking display of white or yellow blooms during the dry season."
