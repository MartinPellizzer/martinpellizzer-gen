    "intro": "Epilobium uliginosum, commonly known as bog myrtle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Its aromatic, woody stems are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Epilobium uliginosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
