    "intro": "Eustachya villosa, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Eustachya villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
