    "intro": "Enallagma macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved jewelwing, is a species of damselfly found in freshwater habitats across North America. It is characterized by its striking blue and green coloration in males, which is used for attracting mates and territorial displays. The plant-like appearance of its wings and body gives it a unique resemblance to certain flowering plants. Its larvae develop in still or slow-moving water, where they feed on aquatic invertebrates. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems as both predator and prey."
