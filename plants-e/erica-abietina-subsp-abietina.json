    "intro": "Erica abietina subsp. abietina, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in poor, acidic soils. The plant produces pink to red flowers in late spring, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or heathland habitats. Erica abietina subsp. abietina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
