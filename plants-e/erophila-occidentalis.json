    "intro": "Erophila occidentalis, commonly known as western erodium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and reliance on parasitic relationships with host plants. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it blooms from spring to early summer. Erophila occidentalis is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
