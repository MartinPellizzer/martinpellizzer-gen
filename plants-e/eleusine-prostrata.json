    "intro": "Eleusine prostrata, commonly known as prostrate eleusine, is a low-growing annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, narrow leaves arranged alternately. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated landscapes."
