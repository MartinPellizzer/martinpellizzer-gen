It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is a member of the Polygonaceae family, known for its distinctive seed structures and ecological importance to native pollinators."
