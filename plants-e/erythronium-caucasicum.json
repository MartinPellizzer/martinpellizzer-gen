    "intro": "Erythronium caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian dog's-tooth violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense white down. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stem bearing a showy, bell-shaped flower with striking yellow petals and a purple throat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservatories."
