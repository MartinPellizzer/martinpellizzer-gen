    "intro": "Ephedra flava, commonly known as yellow ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its green to yellow stems, which are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the medicinal alkaloids ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Its stems are often harvested for use in traditional medicine and modern pharmaceuticals. Ephedra flava is adapted to survive in harsh environments through its ability to store water and minimize transpiration."
