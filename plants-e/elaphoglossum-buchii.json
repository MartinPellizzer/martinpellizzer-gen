    "intro": "Elaphoglossum buchii, commonly known as the Buch's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is a small, delicate fern with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky habitats. Elaphoglossum buchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
