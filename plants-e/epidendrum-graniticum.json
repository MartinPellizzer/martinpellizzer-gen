    "intro": "Epidendrum graniticum, commonly known as the granite orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the dry season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, making it well-suited to its rocky, humid habitat. Epidendrum graniticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
