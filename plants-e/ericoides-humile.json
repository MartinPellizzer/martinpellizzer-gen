    "intro": "Ericoides humile, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters and features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Ericoides humile thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. It is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
