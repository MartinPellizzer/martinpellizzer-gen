    "intro": "Epidendrum centroamericanum, commonly known as the Crimson Spike Orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb and long, arching stems that bear numerous flowers. The plant produces showy, red or orange-red flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, often arranged in racemes. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic plants. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
