    "intro": "Erica selaginifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments due to its drought tolerance. Erica selaginifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
