    "intro": "Euphorbia australis var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for drought resistance. This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it its common name."
