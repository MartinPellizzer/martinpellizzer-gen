    "intro": "Euphorbia serpens f. psilocyathia, commonly known as the psilocybin euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, green stems that produce a milky sap. The plant's most notable feature is the presence of psychoactive compounds, particularly psilocybin, in its latex. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for its psychoactive effects."
