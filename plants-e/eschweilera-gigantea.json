It is characterized by its large, pendulous flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, typically displaying shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a velvety texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color.
