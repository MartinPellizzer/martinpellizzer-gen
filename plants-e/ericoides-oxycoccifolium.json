    "intro": "Ericoides oxycoccifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leafed cowberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a pointed tip. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces bright red berries that are edible but tart. Ericoides oxycoccifolium plays an important ecological role in its harsh environment, providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
