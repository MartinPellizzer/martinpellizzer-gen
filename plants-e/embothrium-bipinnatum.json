    "intro": "Embothrium bipinnatum, commonly known as the Chilean firetree, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Chile and southern Peru. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, red or orange-red flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Embothrium bipinnatum is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular plant in horticulture, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
