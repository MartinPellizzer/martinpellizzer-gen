    "intro": "Euphorbia hastisquama, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of narrow, fleshy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its spiny stems and milky sap, it is considered a hardy and resilient ornamental plant."
