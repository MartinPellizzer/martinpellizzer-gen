    "intro": "Erysimum filifolium, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
