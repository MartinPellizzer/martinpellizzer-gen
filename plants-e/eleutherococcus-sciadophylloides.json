    "intro": "Eleutherococcus sciadophylloides, commonly known as the Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched structure and dark green, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate climates. Its adaptability and resilience make it a valuable plant in both ecological and traditional medicinal contexts."
