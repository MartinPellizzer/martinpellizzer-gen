    "intro": "Eucalyptus isingiana, commonly known as the Isingiana gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to white bark that peels in thin, flaky strips. The leaves are lance-shaped, glossy green, and have a strong aromatic scent when crushed. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and ecological benefits."
