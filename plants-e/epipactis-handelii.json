    "intro": "Epipactis handelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Epipactis handelii is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
