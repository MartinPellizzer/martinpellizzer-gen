    "intro": "Ecbolium subcordatum var. subcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ecbolium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
