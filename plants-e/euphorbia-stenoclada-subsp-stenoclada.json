It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and unique foliage."
