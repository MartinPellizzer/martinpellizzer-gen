    "intro": "Euonymus heterophylus, commonly known as the variable euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being simple and others deeply lobed, depending on the growing conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to release seeds. Its adaptability to different environments makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its tolerance to urban conditions."
