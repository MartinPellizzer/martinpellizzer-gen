    "intro": "Eutacta excelsa var. monstrosa, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its towering, tree-like structure. It features a massive, fibrous trunk that can reach several meters in height, supporting a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant's fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
