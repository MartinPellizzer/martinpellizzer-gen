    "intro": "Eleogiton fluitans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its floating, leaf-like structures that are actually modified stems, known as phyllodes. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. These bladders are filled with air and can be inflated or deflated depending on the plant's needs. Eleogiton fluitans is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation."
