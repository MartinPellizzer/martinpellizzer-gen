    "intro": "Eschweilera tenuifolia, commonly known as the Guiana dwarf mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
