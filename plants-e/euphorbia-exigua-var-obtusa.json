    "intro": "Euphorbia exigua var. obtusa, commonly known as the blunt euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
