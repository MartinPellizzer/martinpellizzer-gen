    "intro": "Espeletia phaneractis, commonly known as the \"P\u00e1ramo flower,\" is a striking plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in the cold, high-altitude environment. It is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean highlands, where temperatures can drop below freezing. Espeletia phaneractis plays an important ecological role in these unique habitats, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
