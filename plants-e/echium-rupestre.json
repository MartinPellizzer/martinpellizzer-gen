    "intro": "Echium rupestre, commonly known as the rock eryngo, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Echium rupestre is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
