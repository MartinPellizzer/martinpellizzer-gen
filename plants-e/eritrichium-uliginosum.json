    "intro": "Eritrichium uliginosum, commonly known as the bog avens, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has a hairy stem and heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Eritrichium uliginosum plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is an indicator species for moist, shaded environments."
