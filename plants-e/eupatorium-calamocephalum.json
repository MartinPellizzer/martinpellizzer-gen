    "intro": "Eupatorium calamocephalum, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a hardy species in humid environments. Eupatorium calamocephalum is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
