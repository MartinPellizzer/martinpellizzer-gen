    "intro": "Erica tetralix var. canescens, commonly known as the grey heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is typically covered in a fine, silvery-grey pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
