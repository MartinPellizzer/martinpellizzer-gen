    "intro": "Elymus smithii, commonly known as Smith's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are arranged in panicles, which are often visible in late summer to early autumn. Elymus smithii thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
