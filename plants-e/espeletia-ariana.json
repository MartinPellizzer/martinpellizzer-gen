    "intro": "Espeletia ariana, commonly known as the Ariana's heath, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth form and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in paramo ecosystems. Its foliage is typically covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to insulate the plant and reduce water loss. Espeletia ariana plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
