    "intro": "Eucalyptus coccifera var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and salinity. This variety is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils."
