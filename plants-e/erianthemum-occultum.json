    "intro": "Erianthemum occultum, commonly known as the hidden leaf geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate species with limited cultivation outside its native range."
