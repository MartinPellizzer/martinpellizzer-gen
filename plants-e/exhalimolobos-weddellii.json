    "intro": "Exhalimolobos weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the cold climates of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, translucent petals. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in extreme environmental conditions. Its growth is slow, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
