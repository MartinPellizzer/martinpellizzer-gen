    "intro": "Erythranthe bridgesii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada phlox, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in its native environment. Erythranthe bridgesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
