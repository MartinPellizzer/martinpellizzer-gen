    "intro": "Elisma natans f. repens, commonly known as the creeping water-plantain, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers that are often borne on long, slender stalks. This variety is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, spreading along the water's surface or substrate."
