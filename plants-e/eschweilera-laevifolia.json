    "intro": "Eschweilera laevifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved evergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are smooth and glossy, and its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Eschweilera laevifolia produces woody capsules as fruits, which contain numerous small, flat seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
