    "intro": "Eugenia tripinnata, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and often have a reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. Eugenia tripinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
