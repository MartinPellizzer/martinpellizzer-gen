    "intro": "Epilobium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and woodlands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pink to purple flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are typically tubular and have five stamens, which are characteristic of the Onagraceae family. Epilobium pauciflorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
