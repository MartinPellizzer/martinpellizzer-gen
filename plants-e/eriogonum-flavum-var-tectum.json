It is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a fibrous root system that aids in stabilizing soil."
