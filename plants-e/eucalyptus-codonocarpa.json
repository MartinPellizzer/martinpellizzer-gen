    "intro": "Eucalyptus codonocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, greyish-brown branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that typically turn red or pink when mature. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and resilience to fire. Eucalyptus codonocarpa plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
