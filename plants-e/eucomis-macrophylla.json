    "intro": "Eucomis macrophylla, commonly known as the cannonball plant, is a striking perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, bulbous base and tall, spiky inflorescences that resemble fireworks, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its foliage consists of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in floral arrangements. Eucomis macrophylla is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
