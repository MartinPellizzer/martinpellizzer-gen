The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive red berries that persist into winter. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant fall foliage and showy fruits. Euonymus oresbius is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
