The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and crevices, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and oval-shaped, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Eriogonum ripleyi plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in mixed shrublands and chaparral ecosystems."
