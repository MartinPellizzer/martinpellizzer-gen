    "intro": "Elaeagia karstenii var. hispidula, commonly known as the rough-leaved elaeagia, is a shrub native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant its \"hispidula\" designation. The flowers are typically small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and the plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
