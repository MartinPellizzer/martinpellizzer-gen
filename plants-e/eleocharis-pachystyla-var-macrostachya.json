    "intro": "Eleocharis pachystyla var. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-stalked spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
