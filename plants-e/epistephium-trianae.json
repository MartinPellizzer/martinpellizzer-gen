    "intro": "Epistephium trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' epistephium, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are palmate, with lobes that are often hairy, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
