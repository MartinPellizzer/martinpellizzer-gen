    "intro": "Epiphyllum bradei, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is known for its striking, showy blooms that appear at night. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its stems are fleshy and segmented, and it produces yellow or orange flowers with prominent red or purple tepals. The plant is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
