    "intro": "Euphorbia setiloba, commonly known as the feathered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, branched stem covered in dense, grayish-blue foliage with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
