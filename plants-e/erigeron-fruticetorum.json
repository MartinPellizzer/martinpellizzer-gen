It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant features a low-growing, shrub-like structure with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are daisy-like, with white petals surrounding a yellow center, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Erigeron fruticetorum plays an important role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators."
