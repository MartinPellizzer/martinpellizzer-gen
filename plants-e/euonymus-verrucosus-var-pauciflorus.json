It is characterized by its distinctive red stems and small, yellow-green leaves that turn orange in the fall. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
