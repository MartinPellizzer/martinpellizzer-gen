    "intro": "Elaphoglossum zambesiacum, commonly known as the Zambesia holly fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
