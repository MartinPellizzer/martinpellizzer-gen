    "intro": "Eriastrum filifolium, commonly known as the threadleaf eriastrum, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry meadows. Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize open spaces, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
