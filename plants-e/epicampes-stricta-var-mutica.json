It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, oval leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical clusters of flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological stability in its native habitat."
