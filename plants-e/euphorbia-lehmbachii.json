    "intro": "Euphorbia lehmbachii, commonly known as the Lehmbach's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia lehmbachii is also noted for its ability to store water in its stems, which helps it survive in harsh conditions."
