    "intro": "Elytrigia jacutorum, commonly known as sea grass or coastal grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and in dunes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Elytrigia jacutorum plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
