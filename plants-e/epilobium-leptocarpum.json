    "intro": "Epilobium leptocarpum, commonly known as narrow-fruit willowherb, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Epilobium leptocarpum is an important species in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to wetland environments."
