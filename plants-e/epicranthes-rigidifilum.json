    "intro": "Epicranthes rigidifilum, commonly known as the rigid filament grass, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and rigid, contributing to its common name, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
