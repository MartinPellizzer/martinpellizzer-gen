It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The plant has narrow, erect leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, showing drought tolerance and resilience to salt spray. Eriachne pindanica plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
