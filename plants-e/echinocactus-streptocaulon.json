    "intro": "Echinocactus streptocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in arid gardens."
