    "intro": "Epidendrum acreense, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, arching stems with clusters of bright green, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to green, with a distinctive red or orange lip. Epidendrum acreense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
