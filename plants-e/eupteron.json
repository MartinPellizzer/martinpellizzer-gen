    "intro": "Eupteron, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Eupteron is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils, and it can become invasive in certain regions."
