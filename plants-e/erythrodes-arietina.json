    "intro": "Erythrodes arietina, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red petals and a distinctive, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
