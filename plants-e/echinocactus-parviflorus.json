    "intro": "Echinocactus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a slow-growing cactus with a globular shape and spiny, segmented stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
