    "intro": "Edraianthus pulevicii, commonly known as the Pulevicii's edraianthus, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy yet specialized species. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
