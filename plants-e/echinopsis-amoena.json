    "intro": "Echinopsis amoena, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its short, thick stem and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it highly drought-tolerant. Echinopsis amoena is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
