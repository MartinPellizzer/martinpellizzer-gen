    "intro": "Erysimum perenne, commonly known as the everlasting or winter flowering poppy, is a hardy, herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It produces striking, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before many other plants. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ability to flower in cold conditions makes it a valuable addition to early-season gardens."
