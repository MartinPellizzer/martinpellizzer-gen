    "intro": "Echium tenoreanum, commonly known as the Sierra Madre Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Echium tenoreanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
