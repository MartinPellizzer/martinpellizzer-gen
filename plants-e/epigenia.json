    "intro": "Epigenia, commonly known as the \"satanic orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Brazil. Epigenia species are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble small, intricate insects, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting flies. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, thriving on tree trunks or rocks. Their botanical significance lies in their specialized adaptations and role in their ecosystems."
