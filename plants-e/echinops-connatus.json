    "intro": "Echinops connatus, commonly known as the Persian globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble small globes, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by the development of its distinctive, woody seed capsules. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Echinops connatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
