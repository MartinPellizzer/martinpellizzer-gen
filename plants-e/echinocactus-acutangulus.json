    "intro": "Echinocactus acutangulus, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
