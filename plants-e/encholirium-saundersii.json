    "intro": "Encholirium saundersii, commonly known as the Mexican sun cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons, which are often followed by the development of red, fleshy fruits. Its stems are covered in small, translucent spines that help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. Encholirium saundersii is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
