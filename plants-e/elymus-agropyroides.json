    "intro": "Elymus agropyroides, commonly known as the rough false oat, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. Elymus agropyroides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
