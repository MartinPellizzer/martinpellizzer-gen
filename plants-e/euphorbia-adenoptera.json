    "intro": "Euphorbia adenoptera, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, which is toxic, can cause skin irritation and is used in traditional medicine. Euphorbia adenoptera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
