    "intro": "Erodium scandicinum, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, wiry stems that sprawl along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pinkish or reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive scent when crushed. Erodium scandicinum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained environments."
