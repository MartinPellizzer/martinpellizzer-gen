    "intro": "Epidendrum bathyschistum, commonly known as the dark-stemmed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, often velvety leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in warm, high humidity conditions. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
