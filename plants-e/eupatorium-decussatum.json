    "intro": "Eupatorium decussatum, commonly known as white boneset, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium decussatum is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
