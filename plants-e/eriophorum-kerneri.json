    "intro": "Eriophorum kerneri, commonly known as the Alpine cotton grass, is a low-growing plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, white, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton, which are produced at the ends of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems. Eriophorum kerneri is often found in tundra and mountainous areas across Europe, Asia, and North America."
