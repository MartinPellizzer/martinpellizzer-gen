It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and elegant appearance, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
