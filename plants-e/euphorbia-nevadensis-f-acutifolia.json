    "intro": "Euphorbia nevadensis f. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid habitats. Its latex sap is milky and can be irritating to the skin, a common feature among euphorbias."
