    "intro": "Eremophila subfloccosa subsp. subfloccosa, commonly known as the Woolly Emu Bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its grey-green foliage, which is densely covered with fine, woolly hairs, providing it with a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to red, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract native pollinators."
