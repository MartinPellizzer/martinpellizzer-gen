It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often resembling those of the genus Bignonia. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are known for their strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
