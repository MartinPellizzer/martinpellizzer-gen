    "intro": "Eucalyptus goniocalyx subsp. exposa, commonly known as the exposed eucalypt, is a rare and unique subspecies native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and are followed by woody capsules. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in its native habitat."
