    "intro": "Erodium serotinum, commonly known as sticky weed or winter redstem, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered pink or red flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Erodium serotinum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind and animals."
