    "intro": "Eriocaulon scabiosa, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spikelets. Eriocaulon scabiosa thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems, contributing to its ecological importance."
