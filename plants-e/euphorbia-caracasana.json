    "intro": "Euphorbia caracasana, commonly known as the Trinidadian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically opposite and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems, making it drought-tolerant. Euphorbia caracasana is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
