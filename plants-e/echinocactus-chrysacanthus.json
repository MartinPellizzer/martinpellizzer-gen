It features a cylindrical stem with yellowish-green skin and produces yellow flowers in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
