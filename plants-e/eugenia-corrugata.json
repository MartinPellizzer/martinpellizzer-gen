    "intro": "Eugenia corrugata, commonly known as the rough eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are often fragrant. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red when mature. Eugenia corrugata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
