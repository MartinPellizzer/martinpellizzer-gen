    "intro": "Epipactis leutei, commonly known as the yellow helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and its striking, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. The flowers are spurred at the base and feature a unique, intricate structure typical of orchids. Epipactis leutei is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
