The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often\u4e1b\u751f, and its leaves are narrow with a rough texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eragrostis palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
