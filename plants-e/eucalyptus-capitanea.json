    "intro": "Eucalyptus capitanea, commonly known as the mountain eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green or yellowish, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Eucalyptus capitanea is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is often found in heathlands and open forests, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
