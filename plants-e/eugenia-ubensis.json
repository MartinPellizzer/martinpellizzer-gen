    "intro": "Eugenia ubensis, commonly known as the Andean guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and potential for fruit production, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and home landscapes."
