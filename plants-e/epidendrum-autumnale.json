    "intro": "Epidendrum autumnale, commonly known as the autumn epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically blooms in the fall, hence its common name, and thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to tolerate short periods of drought. Epidendrum autumnale is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
