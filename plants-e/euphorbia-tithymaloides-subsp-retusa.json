    "intro": "Euphorbia tithymaloides subsp. retusa, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features fleshy, spiny stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a slow growth rate and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
