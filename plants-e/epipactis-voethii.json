    "intro": "Epipactis voethii, commonly known as the Voeth's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshes of northern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20\u201340 centimeters and blooms between June and August. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. Epipactis voethii is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and its limited distribution."
