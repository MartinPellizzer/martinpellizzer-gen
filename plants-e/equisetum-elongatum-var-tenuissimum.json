    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender scouring rush, is a diminutive variety of the scouring rush family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. It is a primitive vascular plant that retains characteristics of both ferns and flowering plants. This variety is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils."
