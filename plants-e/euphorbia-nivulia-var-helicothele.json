    "intro": "Euphorbia nivulia var. helicothele, commonly known as the snowflake euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that resembles a snowball, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its striking appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
