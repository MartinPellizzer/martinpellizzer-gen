    "intro": "Eudema nubigena subsp. remyana, commonly known as the cloud mist eudema, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude cloud forests. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered vulnerable to habitat loss."
