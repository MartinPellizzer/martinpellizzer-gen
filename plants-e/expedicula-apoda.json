    "intro": "Expedicula apoda, commonly known as the leafless liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant's body consists of a thallus, which is a flattened, ribbon-like structure that lies close to the ground. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. Due to its simple structure and lack of vascular tissue, it is considered one of the earliest land plants in evolutionary terms."
