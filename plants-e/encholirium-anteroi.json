It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround a cluster of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Encholirium anteroi is also noted for its ability to tolerate drought conditions once established."
