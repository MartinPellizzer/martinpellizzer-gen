    "intro": "Elcismia dallii, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a hairy, succulent stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Elcismia dallii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various desert animals."
