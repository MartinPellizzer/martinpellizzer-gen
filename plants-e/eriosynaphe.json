    "intro": "Eriosynaphe, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy flowers. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens. Eriosynaphe is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread in disturbed soils."
