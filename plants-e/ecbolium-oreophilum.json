    "intro": "Ecbolium oreophilum, commonly known as the mountain ecbolium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid habitat. Ecbolium oreophilum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
