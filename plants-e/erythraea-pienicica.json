    "intro": "Erythraea pienicica, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Due to overharvesting, Erythraea pienicica is now listed as an endangered species in its native habitat."
