    "intro": "Epilobium ovatifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy, and it produces showy, pink to purple flowers in racemes. It is part of the Onagraceae family, which includes other willow herbs and flowering plants. Epilobium ovatifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
