    "intro": "Euphorbia terracina subvar. provincialis, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and yellowish-green sap, which can be irritant to the skin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of greenish-yellow. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained environments."
