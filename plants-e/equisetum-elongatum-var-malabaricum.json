    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. malabaricum, commonly known as the Malabar horse-tail, is a species of horsetail that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. Its leaves are reduced to small, sterile structures called bracts. This variety is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
