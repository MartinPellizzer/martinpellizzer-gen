    "intro": "Ellobum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Ellobum is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
