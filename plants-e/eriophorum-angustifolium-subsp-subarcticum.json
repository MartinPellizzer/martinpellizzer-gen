    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium subsp. subarcticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wetland habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment."
