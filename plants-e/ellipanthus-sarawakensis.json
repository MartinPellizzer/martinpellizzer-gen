    "intro": "Ellipanthus sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak ellipanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique elliptical leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understorey of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
