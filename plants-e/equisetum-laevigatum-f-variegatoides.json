    "intro": "Equisetum laevigatum f. variegatoides, commonly known as the variegated field horsetail, is a fern ally characterized by its distinctive, segmented, jointed stems. It features whorls of needle-like leaves that are often bright green with subtle variegation, enhancing its ornamental value. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in wetlands or along stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait common among primitive plants. The variegated form adds visual interest, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking unique foliage in shaded landscapes."
