It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically eaten by various bird species, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.
