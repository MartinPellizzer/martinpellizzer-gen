    "intro": "Euphorbia forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to the southwestern United States. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
