    "intro": "Ephedra viridis var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain ephedrine, a compound with historical medicinal uses, though it is now regulated due to its potential for abuse. This species is well adapted to desert conditions, thriving in sandy soils with minimal water availability."
