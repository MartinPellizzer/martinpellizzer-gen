It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale pink, and arranged in clusters, making it a subtle but delicate ornamental plant.
