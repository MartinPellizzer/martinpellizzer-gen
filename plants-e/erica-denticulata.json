    "intro": "Erica denticulata, commonly known as the coastal heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coasts of Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica denticulata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is highly tolerant of coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
