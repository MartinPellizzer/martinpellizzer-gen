    "intro": "Erica prostrata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica prostrata is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
