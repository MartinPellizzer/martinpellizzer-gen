    "intro": "Echeveria agavoides var. agavoides, commonly known as the Mexican snowball, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is ideal for small spaces and requires minimal maintenance."
