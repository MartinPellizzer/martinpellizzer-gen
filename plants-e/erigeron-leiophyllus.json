    "intro": "Erigeron leiophyllus, commonly known as the smoothleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, smooth leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
