    "intro": "Erica foliacea var. galpinii, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This evergreen species is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
