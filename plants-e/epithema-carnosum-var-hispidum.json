    "intro": "Epithema carnosum var. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy leathery lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery thallus with a distinct, granular texture and a pale to dark green or brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
