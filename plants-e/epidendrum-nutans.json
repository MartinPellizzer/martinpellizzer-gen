    "intro": "Epidendrum nutans, commonly known as the drooping orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, fragrant flowers that hang downward. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elliptical and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Epidendrum nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
