    "intro": "Echinocereus viereckii subsp. morricalii, commonly known as Morrical's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, often featuring a dense covering of white or yellowish spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
