It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to survive in arid or semi-arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
