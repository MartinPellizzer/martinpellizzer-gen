It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow composite flower heads in late summer to early fall, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for wetland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and ecologically valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
