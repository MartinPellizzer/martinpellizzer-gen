    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum f. caespitosum, commonly known as the variegated horsetail, is a fern-like plant characterized by its distinctive, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich environments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobiles, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a variegated appearance due to the presence of different colored segments. This form is a compact variant, making it suitable for small garden spaces and rockeries."
