    "intro": "Eutrema fontanum var. microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded sea blush, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shore, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its small, round seeds are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation along coastal habitats. This variety is distinguished by its smaller seeds compared to other varieties within the Eutrema genus."
