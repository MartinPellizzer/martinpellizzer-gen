It is characterized by its woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Eremostachys sogdiana is often found in rocky areas and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
