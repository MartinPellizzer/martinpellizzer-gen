    "intro": "Epidendrum plicatum, commonly known as the pleated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pleated, and often hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the warm season. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Epidendrum plicatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
