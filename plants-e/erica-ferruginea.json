    "intro": "Erica ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. Erica ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
