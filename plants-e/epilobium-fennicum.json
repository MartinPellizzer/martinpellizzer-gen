    "intro": "Epilobium fennicum, commonly known as the northern willow-herb, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra, wet meadows, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy underside. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom in late summer. Epilobium fennicum plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
