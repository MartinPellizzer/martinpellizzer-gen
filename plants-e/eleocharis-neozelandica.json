    "intro": "Eleocharis neozelandica, commonly known as New Zealand spike-rush, is a grass-like plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and lake margins, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Eleocharis neozelandica plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife in its native environment."
