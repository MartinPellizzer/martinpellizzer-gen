    "intro": "Eragrostis eriopoda var. curvispicula, commonly known as the curly-bristle lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dryland environments. The curly bristles on its seed heads are a distinguishing feature of this variety."
