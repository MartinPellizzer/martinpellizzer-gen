It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Erianthus jacquemontii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
