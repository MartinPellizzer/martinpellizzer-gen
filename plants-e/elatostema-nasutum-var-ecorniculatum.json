    "intro": "Elatostema nasutum var. ecorniculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. This variant is distinguished by its reduced inflorescence compared to the typical form of Elatostema nasutum."
