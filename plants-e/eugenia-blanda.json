    "intro": "Eugenia blanda, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 6 feet and features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps or along stream banks. Eugenia blanda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
