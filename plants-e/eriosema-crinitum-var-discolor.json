    "intro": "Eriosema crinitum var. discolor, commonly known as the hairy legume, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, branching stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often accompanied by stipules that are also hairy. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a soft, velvety texture. This variant is notable for its variability in coloration, with some leaves exhibiting a pale or discolored appearance."
