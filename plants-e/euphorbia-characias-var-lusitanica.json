    "intro": "Euphorbia characias var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, spiny stems and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. The plant has a thick, fleshy root system adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
