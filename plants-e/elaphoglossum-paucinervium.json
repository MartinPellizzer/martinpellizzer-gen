    "intro": "Elaphoglossum paucinervium, commonly known as the few-veined holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, wiry appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds and are typically covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum paucinervium is often found in moist, forested habitats, where it thrives in the understory with partial to full shade."
