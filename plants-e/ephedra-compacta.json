    "intro": "Ephedra compacta, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. Ephedra compacta is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in extreme desert conditions."
