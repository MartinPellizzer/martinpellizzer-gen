    "intro": "Eranthis tubergenii, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features delicate, early spring blooms with bright yellow flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are hairy as well. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its early blooming habit, it is an important early nectar source for pollinators."
