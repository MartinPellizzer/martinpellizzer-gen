    "intro": "Epidendrum cryptotropis, commonly known as the cryptotropis orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique flowering pattern and adaptability make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
