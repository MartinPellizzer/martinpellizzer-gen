    "intro": "Eucalyptus hallii, commonly known as the broad-leaved malleefowl eucalypt, is a species native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus hallii is often found in dry, open woodlands and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, have been used in traditional and modern medicinal applications."
