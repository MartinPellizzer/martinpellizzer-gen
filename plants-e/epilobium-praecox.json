    "intro": "Epilobium praecox, commonly known as early willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often nitrogen-rich soils, such as those found in wetlands, riverbanks, and meadows. The plant features erect, often hairy stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The flowers are pink to purple, with five petals, and appear in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer."
