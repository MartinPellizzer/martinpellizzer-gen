    "intro": "Eucalyptus wetarensis, commonly known as the Wetar eucalypt, is a tall, slender tree native to the island of Wetar in Indonesia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves which are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers, often clustered in groups of three. Its timber is valued for its durability and workability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. Additionally, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
