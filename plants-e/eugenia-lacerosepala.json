    "intro": "Eugenia lacerosepala, commonly known as the serrated-leaved eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale pink and are clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that is edible and often consumed by local wildlife and humans in some regions."
