    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 trachyodon f. multirameum, commonly known as the multibracted horsetail, is a hybrid fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of stems and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique combination of features from its parent species, Equisetum trachydon and Equisetum \u00d7 trachyodon, resulting in a distinct morphology. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica is also notable."
