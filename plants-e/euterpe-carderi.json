    "intro": "Euterpe carderi, commonly known as the yellow palm, is a species of palm tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the acai palm. Euterpe carderi is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native environment."
