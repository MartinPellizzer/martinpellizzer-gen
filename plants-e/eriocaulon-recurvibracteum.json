    "intro": "Eriocaulon recurvibracteum, commonly known as the narrow-bract ricegrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is often found in association with water or in damp soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like structure with short, curved bracts, which is a distinguishing feature. Eriocaulon recurvibracteum is often used in ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
