    "intro": "Echinochloa squarrosa, commonly known as rough false brome, is an annual grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, bristly stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
