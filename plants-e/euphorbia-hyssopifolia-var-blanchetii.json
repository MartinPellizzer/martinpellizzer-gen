The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers surrounded by bright green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
