    "intro": "Epidendrum dichromum var. amabile, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture that aids in water retention. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or conservation programs to ensure its survival."
