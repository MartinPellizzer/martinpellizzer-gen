    "intro": "Erysimum asperrimum, commonly known as the rough wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, and the flowers range in color from yellow to orange. Erysimum asperrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
