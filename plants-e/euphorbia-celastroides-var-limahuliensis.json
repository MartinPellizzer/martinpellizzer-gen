    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. limahuliensis, commonly known as the Limahuli euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
