It is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are often winged or flattened, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-adapted to dry climates. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
