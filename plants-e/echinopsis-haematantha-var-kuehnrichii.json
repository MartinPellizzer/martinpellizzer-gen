It is a columnar cactus with a slender, branching stem that often develops a woolly coating. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which open at night. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This variety is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
