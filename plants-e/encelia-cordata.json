    "intro": "Encelia cordata, commonly known as the desert yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, dandelion-like flowers and hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. Encelia cordata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
