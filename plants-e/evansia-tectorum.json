    "intro": "Evansia tectorum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the base of the plant. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to quickly absorb moisture after rainfall. Evansia tectorum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
