It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a short, fleshy stem that bears a single, showy flower. The flower typically has a deep red or orange coloration, with intricate patterns on the lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
