    "intro": "Eriogonum niveum subsp. dichotomum, commonly known as the white flax or white sandbergia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies dichotomum is distinguished by its branching pattern and specific habitat preferences compared to other subspecies of Eriogonum niveum."
