    "intro": "Epimedium musschianum var. multifoliolatum, commonly known as the Chinese barrenwort, is a perennial herb native to China. It features striking, bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has dark green, leathery foliage with a distinctive, lobed leaf shape. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its early blooming habit."
