    "intro": "Elytrigia repens subsp. koeleri, commonly known as Koeler's meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often lie flat on the ground, forming a dense mat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family."
