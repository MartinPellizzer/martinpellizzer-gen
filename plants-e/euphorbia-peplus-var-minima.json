    "intro": "Euphorbia peplus var. minima, commonly known as the smallleaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its milky sap, it is considered a potential irritant to skin and should be handled with care."
