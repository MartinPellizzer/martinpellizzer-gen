It is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Bolivia and Peru. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its upright, branching structure. Its flowers are typically yellow to orange, with a distinctive greenish throat and showy, spurred petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
