    "intro": "Epidorkis recta, commonly known as the straight-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, straight stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. Epidorkis recta is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat."
