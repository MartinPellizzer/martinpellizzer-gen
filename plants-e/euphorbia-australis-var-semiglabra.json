    "intro": "Euphorbia australis var. semiglabra, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are typically greenish-gray in color and covered with a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments."
