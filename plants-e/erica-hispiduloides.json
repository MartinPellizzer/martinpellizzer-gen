It is native to South Africa, where it typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like form and small, needle-like leaves covered in fine, white hairs. Erica hispiduloides produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
