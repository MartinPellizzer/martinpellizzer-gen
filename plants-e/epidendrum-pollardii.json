    "intro": "Epidendrum pollardii, commonly known as the Pink Lady's Slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
