    "intro": "Englerophytum koulamoutouense, commonly known as the Koulamoutou sandbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, grayish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its drought-resistant foliage. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, sun-exposed environments. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
