It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Eritrichium densiflorum is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
