    "intro": "Equisetum telmateia var. conforme, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila at the top of the stem. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
