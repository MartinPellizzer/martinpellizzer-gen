    "intro": "Elymus rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and other arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
