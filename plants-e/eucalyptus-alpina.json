    "intro": "Eucalyptus alpina, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a fragrant, aromatic scent when crushed. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. This hardy species is well adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas."
