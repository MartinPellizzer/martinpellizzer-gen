It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in shallow water or moist soil. Eleocharis praticola plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
