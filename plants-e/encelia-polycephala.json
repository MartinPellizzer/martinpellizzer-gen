    "intro": "Encelia polycephala, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a distinctive globular shape, with dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are small, grayish-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
