It features thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide protection against intense sunlight and drought. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its foliage is typically green with a pale underside, and it has a compact growth habit. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
