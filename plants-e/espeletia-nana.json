    "intro": "Espeletia nana, commonly known as the dwarf espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the center of its foliage. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Espeletia nana is often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
