    "intro": "Erica caespitosa, commonly known as the heather or dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western and southern regions of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Erica caespitosa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
