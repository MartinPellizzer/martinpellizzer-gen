It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are typically a vibrant green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a slight greenish tinge, and are arranged in racemes. Epidendrum chloidophyllum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
