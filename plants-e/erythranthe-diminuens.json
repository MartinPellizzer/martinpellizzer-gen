    "intro": "Erythranthe diminuens, commonly known as the dwarf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are basal, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are bright yellow, with four petals, and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
