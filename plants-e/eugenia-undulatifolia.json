It is characterized by its glossy, wavy-edged leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
