    "intro": "Endiandra artensis, commonly known as the Artens Island endiandra, is a tropical tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Endiandra artensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
