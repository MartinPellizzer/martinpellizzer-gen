    "intro": "Epidendrum melanocaulon, commonly known as the black-stemmed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, showy lips. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
