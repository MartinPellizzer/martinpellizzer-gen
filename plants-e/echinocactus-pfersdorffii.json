    "intro": "Echinocactus pfersdorffii, commonly known as the Pfersdorff's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and prominent, sharp spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens."
