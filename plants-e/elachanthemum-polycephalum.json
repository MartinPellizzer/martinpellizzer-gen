It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, with woolly, grayish-green leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
