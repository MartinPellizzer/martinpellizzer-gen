It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
