    "intro": "Elaeagnus obovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery, glandular-hairy leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen. Elaeagnus obovatifolia is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
