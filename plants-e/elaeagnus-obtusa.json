    "intro": "Elaeagnus obtusa, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible berries that are sweet and slightly tart. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Elaeagnus obtusa is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it useful in soil rehabilitation."
