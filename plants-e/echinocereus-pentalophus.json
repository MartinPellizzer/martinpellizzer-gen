    "intro": "Echinocereus pentalophus, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a compact, globular shape and produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its fleshy stems store water, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects, such as moths, and the plant is also known for its edible fruit, though it is often used in traditional medicine."
