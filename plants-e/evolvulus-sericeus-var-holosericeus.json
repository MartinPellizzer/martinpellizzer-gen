It is characterized by its velvety, silver-green foliage and trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a vigorous climber with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can be invasive in some regions."
