It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Elymus cylindricus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
