    "intro": "Euphorbia dregeana, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features distinctive, branching stems covered in a thick layer of white, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution."
