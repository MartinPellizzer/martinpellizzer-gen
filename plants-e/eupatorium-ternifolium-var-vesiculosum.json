    "intro": "Eupatorium ternifolium var. vesiculosum, commonly known as the fragrant marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The varietal form, vesiculosum, is distinguished by its inflated, balloon-like seed pods that aid in wind dispersal."
