    "intro": "Echinocarpus celebicus, commonly known as the hairy burr or hairy echinocarp, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its spiny, hairy fruits that encase the seeds, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. It typically grows in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and waste places, and is often considered a weed. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
