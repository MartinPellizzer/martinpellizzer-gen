    "intro": "Echinocactus johnstonianus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, spiny stem that resembles a barrel, which helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, ribbed structure is adapted to withstand arid conditions and intense sunlight. Echinocactus johnstonianus is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
