    "intro": "Eriogonum nudicaule subsp. typicum, commonly known as the slender leaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
