    "intro": "Eupatorium petrophilum, commonly known as mountain boneset, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Eupatorium petrophilum is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
