    "intro": "Eriophyllum wallacei var. australe, commonly known as the Australian woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow ray florets and a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
