    "intro": "Eryngium floribundum var. serroides, commonly known as the blue thistle or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spiked flower heads, which are surrounded by finely divided, silver-gray bracts. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are spiny and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
