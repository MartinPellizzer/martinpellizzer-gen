    "intro": "Elaeodendron glaucum var. cochinchinense, commonly known as the Vietnamese white sand tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal or lowland areas. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
