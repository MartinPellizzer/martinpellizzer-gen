    "intro": "Erythronium niveum var. pedemontanum, commonly known as the Alpine white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Liliaceae family."
