    "intro": "Echinopsis picta, commonly known as the \"Painted Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help it conserve water in arid environments. It produces a dense cluster of flowers at the top of the stem, often in late summer. Echinopsis picta is well-suited for cultivation in warm, sunny climates with well-draining soil."
