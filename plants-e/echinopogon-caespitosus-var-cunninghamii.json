    "intro": "Echinopogon caespitosus var. cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
