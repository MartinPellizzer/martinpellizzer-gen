    "intro": "Echidnopsis malum, commonly known as the Malum Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its ghostly white petals and sepals, which give it its ethereal appearance. It has a unique growth habit, with a short, thick rhizome and a single, showy flower that blooms infrequently. Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species."
