    "intro": "Euphorbia schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiede's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
