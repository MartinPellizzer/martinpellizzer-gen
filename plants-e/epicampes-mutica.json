    "intro": "Epicampes mutica, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. The species is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate periods of submergence."
