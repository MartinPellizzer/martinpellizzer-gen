    "intro": "Evax pygmaea var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan dwarf pomegranate, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa. It features small, dark green leaves and produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its edible, red-orange fruits that are smaller than typical pomegranates. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a container plant."
