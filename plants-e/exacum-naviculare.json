    "intro": "Exacum naviculare, commonly known as the boatleaf pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, lance-shaped leaves that often have a slightly wavy edge. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long flowering period."
