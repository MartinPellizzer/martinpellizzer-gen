    "intro": "Eurygania phillyreifolia, commonly known as the silky sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eurygania phillyreifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators."
