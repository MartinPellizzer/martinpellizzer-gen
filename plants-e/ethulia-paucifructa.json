    "intro": "Ethulia paucifructa, commonly known as the rare fruit-bearing shrub, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Following flowering, it develops fruit that is oval-shaped and contains a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ethulia paucifructa is considered a rare and endangered species."
