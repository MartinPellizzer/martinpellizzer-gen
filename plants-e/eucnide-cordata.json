    "intro": "Eucnide cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf sturt's onion, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, succulent leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
