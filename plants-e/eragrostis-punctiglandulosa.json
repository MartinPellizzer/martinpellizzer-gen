    "intro": "Eragrostis punctiglandulosa, commonly known as the punctured gland grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct, punctuated glands along the leaf sheaths, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Eragrostis punctiglandulosa is adapted to arid conditions and is resilient to drought."
