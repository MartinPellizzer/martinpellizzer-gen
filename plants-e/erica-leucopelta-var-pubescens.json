    "intro": "Erica leucopelta var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal landscapes."
