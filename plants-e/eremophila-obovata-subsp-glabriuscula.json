    "intro": "Eremophila obovata subsp. glabriuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the subspecies glabriuscula has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers in spikes, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
