    "intro": "Eustephia kawidei, commonly known as the Kawidei starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family, which includes species like willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically during the spring season. Eustephia kawidei thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
