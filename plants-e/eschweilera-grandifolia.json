    "intro": "Eschweilera grandifolia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of the water. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving or still waters. Eschweilera grandifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
