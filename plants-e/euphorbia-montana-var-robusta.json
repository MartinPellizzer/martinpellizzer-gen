It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often adorned with distinctive yellowish-green sap. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by colorful bracts that give it a showy appearance. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating. This species is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
