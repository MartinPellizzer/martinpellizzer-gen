    "intro": "Exostema corymbiferum, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in dense, branching clusters. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive, rough, coral-like texture, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The coral tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm, sunny climates."
