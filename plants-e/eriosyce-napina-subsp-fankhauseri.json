    "intro": "Eriosyce napina subsp. fankhauseri, commonly known as the Fankhauser's rock cactus, is a rare and endemic cactus species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the top of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
