    "intro": "Eugenia osteomeloides, commonly known as the red eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, round berries that are red when ripe. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties. The species is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
