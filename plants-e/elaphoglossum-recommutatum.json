    "intro": "Elaphoglossum recommutatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of tiny, glandular hairs. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Elaphoglossum recommutatum is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas."
