    "intro": "Ecbolium ilhense, commonly known as the Ilhense burr vine, is a flowering plant native to the island of Ilha do Maracuj\u00e1 in Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive burr-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ecbolium ilhense is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in coastal or sandy environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species with potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
