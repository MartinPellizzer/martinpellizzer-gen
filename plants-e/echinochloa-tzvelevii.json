It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppe and grasslands. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
