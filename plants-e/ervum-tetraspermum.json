    "intro": "Ervum tetraspermum, commonly known as the four-seeded vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing four seeds each. Ervum tetraspermum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution across its native range."
