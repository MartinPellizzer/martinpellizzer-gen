    "intro": "Euphorbia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's spurge, is a striking plant native to the Alps, particularly in France and Italy. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique structure with a central stem and surrounding bracts that resemble flowers, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small, green, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Euphorbia humbertii is also notable for its latex, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
