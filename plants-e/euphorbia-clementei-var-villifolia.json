    "intro": "Euphorbia clementei var. villifolia, commonly known as the \"Clementine Spurge,\" is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, multi-stemmed growth habit with thick, fleshy stems covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
