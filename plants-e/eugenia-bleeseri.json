    "intro": "Eugenia bleeseri, commonly known as the Bleecker's guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, pinkish-red fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
