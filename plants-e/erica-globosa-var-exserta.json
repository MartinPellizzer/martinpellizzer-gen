    "intro": "Erica globosa var. exserta, commonly known as the exserted heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Erica globosa var. exserta is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, hardy ground cover."
