    "intro": "Erioneuron avenaceum var. longearistatum, commonly known as the long-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and soil stabilization. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats."
