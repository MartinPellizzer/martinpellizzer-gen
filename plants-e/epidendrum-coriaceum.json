    "intro": "Epidendrum coriaceum, commonly known as the tough-leaved epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically bright orange or red, with a prominent lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum coriaceum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its resilience and ornamental value."
