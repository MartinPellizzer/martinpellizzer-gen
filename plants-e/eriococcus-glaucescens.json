    "intro": "Eriococcus glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green woolly aphid, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Diaspididae. It is characterized by its dense, waxy, and often bluish-green coating that covers its body. This coating helps protect the insect from predators and environmental stressors. The plant it infests is typically a woody shrub or tree, where it feeds on sap from the phloem tissues. Due to its appearance and habitat, it is often found on plants in the genus Eucalyptus."
