    "intro": "Eucalyptus ancophila, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus ancophila thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various native animals."
