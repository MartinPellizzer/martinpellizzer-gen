    "intro": "Euodia sambucina, commonly known as blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Euodia sambucina is also valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
