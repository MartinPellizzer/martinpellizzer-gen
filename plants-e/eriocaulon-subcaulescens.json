    "intro": "Eriocaulon subcaulescens, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact inflorescences. Native to wetland and marshy habitats, it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces tiny, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often concealed by its dense vegetation. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
