    "intro": "Eleocharis plicarhachis, commonly known as the pleated spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that is often pleated or folded, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along the edges of ponds or in shallow water. Its leaves are grass-like and often have a distinctive sheathing base. Eleocharis plicarhachis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
