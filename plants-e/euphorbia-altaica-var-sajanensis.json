    "intro": "Euphorbia altaica var. sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, a common adaptation in the Euphorbiaceae family. This species is often found growing in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it contributes to the unique flora of its native habitat."
