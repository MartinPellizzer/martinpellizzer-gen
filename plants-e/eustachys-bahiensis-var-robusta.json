    "intro": "Eustachys bahiensis var. robusta, commonly known as the robust panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
