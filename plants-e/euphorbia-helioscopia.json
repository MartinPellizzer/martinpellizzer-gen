The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in spherical structures called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. Euphorbia helioscopia is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and sunny environments."
