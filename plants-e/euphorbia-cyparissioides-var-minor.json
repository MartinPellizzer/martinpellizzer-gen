    "intro": "Euphorbia cyparissioides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf cypress spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with dark green, needle-like leaves that resemble those of a cypress tree. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the characteristic flower-like structures of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental appeal comes from its foliage and ability to form a neat, low-growing mound."
