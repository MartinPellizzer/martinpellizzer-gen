    "intro": "Eucalyptus sepulcralis, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a rough texture. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale or creamy white, followed by woody, urn-shaped capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
