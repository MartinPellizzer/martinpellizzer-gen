    "intro": "Erica pomifera, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erica pomifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
