    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. vulgare, commonly known as common erodium, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
