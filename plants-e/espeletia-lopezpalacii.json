It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its structure and appearance make it well-suited for survival in cold, nutrient-poor soils."
