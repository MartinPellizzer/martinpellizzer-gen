    "intro": "Eranthis lobulata, commonly known as the early yellow violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with toothed margins, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-30 cm and prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soils. It is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, where it thrives in partial shade. Eranthis lobulata is valued for its early blooming and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
