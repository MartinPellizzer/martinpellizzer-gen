    "intro": "Eugenia kiahii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf eugenia, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Eugenia kiahii var. angustifolia plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects."
