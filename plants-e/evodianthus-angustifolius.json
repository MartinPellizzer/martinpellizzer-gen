    "intro": "Evodianthus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved evodianthus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Evodianthus angustifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
