    "intro": "Euclea polyandra, commonly known as the African bloodwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and distinctive, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Euclea polyandra is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its hard, durable wood. It also has traditional medicinal uses in some indigenous communities."
