    "intro": "Euphorbia boetica, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, upright stem that is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, making handling the plant require caution. Euphorbia boetica is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and dry habitats."
