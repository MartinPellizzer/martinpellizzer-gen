    "intro": "Elymus glaucus var. planifolius, commonly known as the flat-leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its narrow, flat blades that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are often tinged with blue or purple hues. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
