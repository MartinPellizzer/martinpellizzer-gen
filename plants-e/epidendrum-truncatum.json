    "intro": "Epidendrum truncatum, commonly known as the Truncated Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Epidendrum truncatum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
