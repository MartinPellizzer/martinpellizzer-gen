It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in the spring. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its slender stems and glandular hairs. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
