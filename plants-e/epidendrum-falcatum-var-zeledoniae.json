    "intro": "Epidendrum falcatum var. zeledoniae, commonly known as the Zelodonia Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
