    "intro": "Engelhardia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Borneo Engelhardia, is a rare tropical tree native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its mountainous habitat. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it produces small, clustered fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
