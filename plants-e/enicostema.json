    "intro": "Enicostema, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, characterized by their slender stems and narrow leaves. Enicostema species often form dense grasslands and are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
