    "intro": "Euphorbia betulicortex, commonly known as the birch-bark spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its smooth, bark-like stems that resemble birch trees. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a slightly serrated edge. Euphorbia betulicortex is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
