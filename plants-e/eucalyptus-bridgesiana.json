    "intro": "Eucalyptus bridgesiana, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the south-western region of Western Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The tree has a rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age, and its leaves are narrow, grey-green, and aromatic. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is adapted to arid conditions and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
