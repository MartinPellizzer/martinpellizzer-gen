The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are often adorned with silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
