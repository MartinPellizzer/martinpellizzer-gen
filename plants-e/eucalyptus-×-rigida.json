    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 rigida, commonly known as the rigid box gum, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rigid, angular branches and smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin flakes. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
