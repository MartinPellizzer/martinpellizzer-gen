    "intro": "Epidendrum renanthera, commonly known as the orchid with a golden beard, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, yellow flowers with a distinctive golden beard-like structure on the lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Epidendrum renanthera is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
