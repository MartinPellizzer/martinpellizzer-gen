    "intro": "Euphorbia bellica, commonly known as the war plant, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia bellica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
