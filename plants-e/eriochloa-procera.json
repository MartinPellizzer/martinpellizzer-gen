    "intro": "Eriochloa procera, commonly known as tall muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish to purplish flower clusters that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Eriochloa procera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
