    "intro": "Ericoides involucratum, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in late spring, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. Ericoides involucratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
