    "intro": "Eucalyptus farinosa, commonly known as the white mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to white bark that peels in thin sheets. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine, powdery coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
