    "intro": "Euphorbia nakaii, commonly known as the Korean spurge, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
