    "intro": "Espeletia formosa, commonly known as the \"Pineapple Plant\" or \"Cactus of the Clouds,\" is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage composed of thick, fleshy, spiny leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces a large, showy inflorescence with yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for high-altitude, nutrient-poor soils. Espeletia formosa is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
