    "intro": "Eriogonum holmgrenii, commonly known as the Holmgren's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eriogonum holmgrenii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in native plant gardens."
