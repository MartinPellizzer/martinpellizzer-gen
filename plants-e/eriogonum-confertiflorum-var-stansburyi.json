    "intro": "Eriogonum confertiflorum var. stansburyi, commonly known as the Stansbury's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the Polygonaceae family, known for its distinctive seed structures called achenes."
