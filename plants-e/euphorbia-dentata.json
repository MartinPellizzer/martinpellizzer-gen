    "intro": "Euphorbia dentata, commonly known as the toothed spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, branched stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated or toothed margin, giving it its common name. Euphorbia dentata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
