    "intro": "Echthronema californica, commonly known as the California goldenbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Echthronema californica is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
