    "intro": "Erica terminalis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Erica terminalis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
