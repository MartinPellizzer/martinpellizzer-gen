    "intro": "Eritrichium gracillimum, commonly known as the slender alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with delicate, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves, adapted to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats. Eritrichium gracillimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
