    "intro": "Edraianthus serbicus subsp. stankovicii, commonly known as the Stankovi\u0107's edraianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-violet flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and its preference for rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
