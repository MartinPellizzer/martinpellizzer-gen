It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Erigeron buchii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators."
