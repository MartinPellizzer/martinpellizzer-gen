    "intro": "Euphorbia peplus var. minor, commonly known as lesser spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The plant contains toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation and is harmful if ingested. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides and fields. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
