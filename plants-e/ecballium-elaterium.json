    "intro": "Ecballium elaterium, commonly known as the common cow-plant or blister cucumber, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash. The plant produces small, green fruits that mature into distinctive, spiky, yellow-orange berries. These berries contain a toxic sap that can cause blistering of the skin upon contact. The plant is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils, and it has a short growing season."
