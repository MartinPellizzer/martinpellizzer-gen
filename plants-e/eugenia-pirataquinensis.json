    "intro": "Eugenia pirataquinensis, commonly known as the pirate's quinine tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by small, red, fleshy berries. It is known for containing quinine-like compounds, which have historically been of interest for medicinal research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
