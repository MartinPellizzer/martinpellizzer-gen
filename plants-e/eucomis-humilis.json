    "intro": "Eucomis humilis, commonly known as the common pineapple lily, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette, and it produces clusters of white to pale blue flowers that resemble pineapples, giving it its common name. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, adding a striking visual element to gardens with its unique floral display. Eucomis humilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in temperate climates."
