It is characterized by its hairy, blue-green foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering stems are often branched and bear numerous florets that are pale blue to white in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude habitats."
