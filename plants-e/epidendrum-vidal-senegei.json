    "intro": "Epidendrum vidal-senegei, commonly known as the Vidal-Senegei Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms during the warmer months, and its pseudobulbs are covered in a thick, waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
