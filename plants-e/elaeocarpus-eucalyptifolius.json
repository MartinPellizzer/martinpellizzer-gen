    "intro": "Elaeocarpus eucalyptifolius, commonly known as the satinwood or silverwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces woody, spherical fruits that enclose a single, edible seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are glossy and have a unique, aromatic scent, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland forests and coastal areas."
