    "intro": "Eisenmannia clandestina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. Its unique appearance and habitat requirements have made it a subject of botanical interest and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
