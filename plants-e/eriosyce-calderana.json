    "intro": "Eriosyce calderana, commonly known as the Caldera sea-urchin cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
