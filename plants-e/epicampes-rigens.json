    "intro": "Epicampes rigens, commonly known as the rigid thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a tall, upright stem covered in sharp, spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, purple to violet flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often coated with a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Epicampes rigens is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species found in various habitats across its native range."
