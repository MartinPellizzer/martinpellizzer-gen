    "intro": "Eumachia insidens subsp. insidens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed eumachia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species."
