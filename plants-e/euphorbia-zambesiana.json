    "intro": "Euphorbia zambesiana, commonly known as the Zambesian spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
