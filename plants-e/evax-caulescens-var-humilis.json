    "intro": "Evax caulescens var. humilis, commonly known as the low-growing form of the genus Evax, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves. It typically features stems that are short and often prostrate, adapting to its environment by spreading along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or white in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for specific wetland habitats."
