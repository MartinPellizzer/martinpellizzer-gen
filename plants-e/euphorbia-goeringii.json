    "intro": "Euphorbia goeringii, commonly known as the Chinese spurge or Goering's spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a distinctive rosette of thick, waxy, and often blue-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia goeringii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
