It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
