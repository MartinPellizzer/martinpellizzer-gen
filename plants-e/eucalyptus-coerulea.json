    "intro": "Eucalyptus coerulea, commonly known as the blue gum, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southeastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus coerulea is often found in open forests and woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
