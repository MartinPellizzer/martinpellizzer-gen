    "intro": "Erodium subtrilobum var. glanduliferum, commonly known as sticky erodium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, reddish-purple flowers and glandular, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in sunny environments. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This species is often found in coastal scrub and grassland habitats."
