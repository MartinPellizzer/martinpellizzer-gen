    "intro": "Erythroxylum cuneifolium var. silvaticum, commonly known as the wild coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces elliptical, bright red berries that contain minute seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests. Due to its relation to the coca plant, it has been studied for its potential pharmacological properties."
