    "intro": "Euceraea rheophytica, commonly known as the streamside orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically along streams and in rocky crevices. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered blooms in shades of white and pale pink. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires a consistently humid climate to survive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euceraea rheophytica is considered an endangered species in many regions."
