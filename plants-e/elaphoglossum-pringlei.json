    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that often exhibit a bronze or reddish hue when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense, low-growing colonies. Elaphoglossum pringlei is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
