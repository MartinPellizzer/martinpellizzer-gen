    "intro": "Eugenia australis, commonly known as the Australian myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, featuring dense, glossy green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. Eugenia australis is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife make it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes."
