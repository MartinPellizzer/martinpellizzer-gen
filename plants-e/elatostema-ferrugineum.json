It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. The plant features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a reddish or rusty-colored pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white petals and yellow stamens, appearing in late spring to early summer. Elatostema ferrugineum is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for high humidity."
