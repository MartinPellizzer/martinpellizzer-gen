It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
