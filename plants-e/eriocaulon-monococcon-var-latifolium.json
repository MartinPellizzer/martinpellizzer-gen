    "intro": "Eriocaulon monococcon var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and the plant is often found in association with other wetland vegetation."
