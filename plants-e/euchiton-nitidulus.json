It is characterized by its simple, smooth leaves and small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale green, appearing in clusters. Euchiton nitidulus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
