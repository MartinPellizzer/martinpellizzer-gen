    "intro": "Enckea platyphylla, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant white flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically valued in the crafting of musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
