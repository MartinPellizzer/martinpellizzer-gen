    "intro": "Eucalyptus crenulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringybark, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a distinctive white bloom. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has smooth, peeling bark that gives it a unique appearance. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
