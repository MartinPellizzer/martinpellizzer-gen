    "intro": "Esula vulgaris, commonly known as the common esula, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Esula vulgaris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
