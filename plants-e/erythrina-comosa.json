    "intro": "Erythrina comosa, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous legume native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange floral clusters that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has feathery, trifoliate leaves and produces pods that contain flat, fibrous seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a popular ornamental and forage species. Erythrina comosa also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
