    "intro": "Elymus riparius, commonly known as riparian grass or river grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and marshy areas, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, while its seeds provide food for various bird and small mammal species. Elymus riparius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
