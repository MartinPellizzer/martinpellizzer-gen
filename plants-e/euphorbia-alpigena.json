    "intro": "Euphorbia alpigena, commonly known as the alpine spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh, cold climates. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia. It is characterized by its latex-filled stems, which can be toxic if ingested. Euphorbia alpigena plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals."
