    "intro": "Elegia glauca, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and wetland habitats. Elegia glauca is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
