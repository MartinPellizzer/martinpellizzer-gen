It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential agricultural applications."
