    "intro": "Epilobium glandulosum var. exaltatum, commonly known as the tall willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its glandular-stemmed structure and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
