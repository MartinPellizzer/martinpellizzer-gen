    "intro": "Epidendrum iang-rondonii, commonly known as the Rondonia orchid, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
