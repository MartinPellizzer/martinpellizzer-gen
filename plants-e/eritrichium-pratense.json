    "intro": "Eritrichium pratense, commonly known as the meadow bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Eritrichium pratense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
