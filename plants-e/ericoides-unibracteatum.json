    "intro": "Ericoides unibracteatum, commonly known as the single-bract ericoid, is a unique plant species belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ericoides unibracteatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for various invertebrates and its contribution to soil stabilization in its native range."
