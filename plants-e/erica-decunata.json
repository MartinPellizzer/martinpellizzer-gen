    "intro": "Erica decunata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the western and southern regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It is adapted to dry, coastal climates and is drought-tolerant once established. Erica decunata plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
