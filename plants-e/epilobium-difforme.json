    "intro": "Epilobium difforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lanceolate with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and borne in dense spikes, contributing to its ornamental value. Epilobium difforme is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
