    "intro": "Euphorbia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments. It has a low-growing habit and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Euphorbia littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
