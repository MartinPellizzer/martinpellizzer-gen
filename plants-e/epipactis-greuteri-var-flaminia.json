    "intro": "Epipactis greuteri var. flaminia, commonly known as the Flaminian helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. It has a short flowering period in late spring and is pollinated by flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
