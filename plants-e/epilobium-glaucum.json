    "intro": "Epilobium glaucum, commonly known as silverweed, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, waxy hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. Its flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and are usually pink or purple in color. Epilobium glaucum is a perennial species that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
