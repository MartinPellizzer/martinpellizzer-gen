    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. ramulosum, commonly known as the swamp horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorls of small, needle-like leaves. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is notable for its ancient evolutionary lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in wetland environments. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species for wetland habitats."
