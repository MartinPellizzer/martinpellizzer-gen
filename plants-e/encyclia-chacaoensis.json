    "intro": "Encyclia chacaoensis, commonly known as the Chacao orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive yellow and green coloration, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
