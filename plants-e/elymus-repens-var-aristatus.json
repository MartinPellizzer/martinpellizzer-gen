    "intro": "Elymus repens var. aristatus, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form a mat-like structure. The plant produces spikelets that are typically elongated and bear awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
