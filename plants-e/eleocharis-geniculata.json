    "intro": "Eleocharis geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often exhibit a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. Eleocharis geniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
