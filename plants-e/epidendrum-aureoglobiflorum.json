It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. Its most distinctive characteristic is its large, showy yellow flowers with a golden-orange center. The inflorescence can reach up to 30 cm in length, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens and greenhouses."
