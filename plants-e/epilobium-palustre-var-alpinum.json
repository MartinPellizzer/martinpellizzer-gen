    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are oval to lance-shaped with a hairy surface. It produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and adaptation to cold, high-altitude environments."
