It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Eragrostis tinge-lingua is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in regions with limited water availability."
