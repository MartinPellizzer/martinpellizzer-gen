It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. This plant is not only ornamental but also supports various pollinators due to its nectar-rich flowers."
