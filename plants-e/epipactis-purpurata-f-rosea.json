    "intro": "Epipactis purpurata f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
