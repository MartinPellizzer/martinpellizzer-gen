    "intro": "Eugenia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Eugenia spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
