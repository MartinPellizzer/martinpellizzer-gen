    "intro": "Eulophia alta, commonly known as the tall eulophia, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that often display a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Eulophia alta is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
