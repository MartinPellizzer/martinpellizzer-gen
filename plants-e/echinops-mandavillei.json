    "intro": "Echinops mandavillei, commonly known as the mandaville thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive bristly fruit. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Echinops mandavillei is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
