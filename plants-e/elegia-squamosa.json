    "intro": "Elegia squamosa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Elegia squamosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
