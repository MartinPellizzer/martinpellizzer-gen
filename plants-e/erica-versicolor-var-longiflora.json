    "intro": "Erica versicolor var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy environments."
