    "intro": "Echinopepon longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined melon, is a unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, spiny fruits that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female blooms. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The fruit's spines provide natural protection against herbivores, making it an interesting subject for ecological studies."
