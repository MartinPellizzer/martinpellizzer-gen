    "intro": "Erythroxylum bangii, commonly known as the Bangi coca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. It produces elliptical, dark red berries that contain several seeds. Due to its morphological similarities to other coca species, it has been the subject of taxonomic debate."
