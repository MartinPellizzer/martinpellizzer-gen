    "intro": "Elatostema radicans var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping elatostema, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily, making it a common ground cover in humid climates."
