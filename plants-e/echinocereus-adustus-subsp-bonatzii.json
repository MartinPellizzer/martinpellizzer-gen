    "intro": "Echinocereus adustus subsp. bonatzii, commonly known as the Bonatzii cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a compact, rounded shape and a dense covering of white to pale blue hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
