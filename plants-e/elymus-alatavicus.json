    "intro": "Elymus alatavicus, commonly known as the Altavus needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppe and desert regions. Elymus alatavicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
