    "intro": "Ebnerella fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ebnerella fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
