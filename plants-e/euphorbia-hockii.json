    "intro": "Euphorbia hockii, commonly known as the Hock's spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive stem with a smooth, greenish-gray surface and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has milky sap that can cause skin irritation, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
