    "intro": "Elettaria coccinea, commonly known as red cardamom, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, red-colored seed pods. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the distinctive red, three-lobed fruits. The seeds inside the pods are the primary commercial product, valued for their intense flavor and medicinal properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for both culinary and traditional uses."
