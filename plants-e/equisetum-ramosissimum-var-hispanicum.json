    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish horse tail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and needle-like leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This variety is native to southern Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, a feature typical of its ancient lineage. It is considered a relic of the Carboniferous period and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
