    "intro": "Erica intertexta, commonly known as the common heath, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family, Ericaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica intertexta is a low-growing shrub, often forming dense thickets that provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its foliage is evergreen, with needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment."
