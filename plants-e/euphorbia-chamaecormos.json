    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaecormos, commonly known as the cushion spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, compact clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine habitats, often forming mats to protect against harsh weather conditions. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
