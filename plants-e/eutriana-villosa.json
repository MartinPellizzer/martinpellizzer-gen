    "intro": "Eutriana villosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, where it can efficiently capture prey. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in adhesion and prey attraction. Eutriana villosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
