It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that range in color from green to blue-gray, often with a vibrant pink or red edge. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its coloration. Due to its variability, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
