    "intro": "Espeletia occulta, commonly known as the hidden espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized structures called capitula. The plant is typically found in high-altitude environments, such as p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Espeletia occulta is known for its rosette-like growth form, with dense, woolly leaves that help retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. Its flowers, which are often pale or bluish in color, contribute to its ecological role in pollination and seed dispersal."
