    "intro": "Erigeron nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. Erigeron nevadensis is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in higher elevation areas."
