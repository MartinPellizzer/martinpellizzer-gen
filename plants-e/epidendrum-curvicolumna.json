    "intro": "Epidendrum curvicolumna, commonly known as the narrow-columned epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant typically features long, slender pseudobulbs and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
