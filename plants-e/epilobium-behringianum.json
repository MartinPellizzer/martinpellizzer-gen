    "intro": "Epilobium behringianum, commonly known as the Alaska willow, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in wet, acidic soils along stream banks and in alpine tundra. The plant produces showy pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. Epilobium behringianum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
