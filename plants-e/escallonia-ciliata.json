    "intro": "Escallonia ciliata, commonly known as the coastal escallonia, is a shrub native to southern South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers in spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance. Escallonia ciliata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
