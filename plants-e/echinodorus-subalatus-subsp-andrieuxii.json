    "intro": "Echinodorus subalatus subsp. andrieuxii, commonly known as the Andrieux's sword plant, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often slightly undulating and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It is a popular choice for aquariums due to its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Echinodorus species."
