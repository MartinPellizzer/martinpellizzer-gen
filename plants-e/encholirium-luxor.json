    "intro": "Encholirium luxor, commonly known as the Luxor grass, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or white, bloom in late spring and are clustered in a short inflorescence. Encholirium luxor is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in open grasslands."
