It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, with small, spikelet-like flowers. Eragrostis obtusiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant gardens."
