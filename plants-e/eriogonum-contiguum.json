    "intro": "Eriogonum contiguum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky areas and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum contiguum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a common sight in mountainous regions."
