    "intro": "Elymus sinicus var. medius, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, awned florets. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun exposure. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it useful for erosion control and as a forage crop. The plant is also valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture and habitat restoration due to its hardiness and adaptability."
