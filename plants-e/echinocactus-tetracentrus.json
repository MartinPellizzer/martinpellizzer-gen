    "intro": "Echinocactus tetracentrus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the plant during the growing season. Echinocactus tetracentrus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
