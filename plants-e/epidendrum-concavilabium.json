    "intro": "Epidendrum concavilabium, commonly known as the concave-lipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking flowers with a unique, concave lip that is typically a vibrant pink or red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum concavilabium is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
