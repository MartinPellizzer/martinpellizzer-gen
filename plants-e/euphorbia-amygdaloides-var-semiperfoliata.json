    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides var. semiperfoliata, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a perennial succulent native to the eastern United States. It features striking silver-gray leaves with a waxy texture, and its stems are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a low, compact shrub with a distinctive appearance."
