    "intro": "Ebenus ruminata, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow, rayless flowers that form a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Ebenus ruminata is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
