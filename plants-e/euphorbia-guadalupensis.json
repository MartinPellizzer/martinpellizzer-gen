    "intro": "Euphorbia guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems covered in a thick layer of white, waxy sap, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores and excessive moisture loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, aiding in water conservation. Euphorbia guadalupensis is well adapted to harsh desert environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
