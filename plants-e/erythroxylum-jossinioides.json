    "intro": "Erythroxylum jossinioides, commonly known as the Jossinioides coca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, woody capsules containing elliptical seeds. It is closely related to other species in the Erythroxylum genus, some of which are known for their psychoactive properties. Due to its potential for cultivation and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
