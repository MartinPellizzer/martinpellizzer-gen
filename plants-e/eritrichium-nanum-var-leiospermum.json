    "intro": "Eritrichium nanum var. leiospermum, commonly known as the smooth-seeded mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
