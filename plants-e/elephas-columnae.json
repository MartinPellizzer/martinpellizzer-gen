    "intro": "Elephas columnae, commonly known as the columnar elephant, is a unique species of cactus native to the deserts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the ends of the stems during the spring and summer months. Elephas columnae is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
