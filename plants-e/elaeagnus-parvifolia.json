    "intro": "Elaeagnus parvifolia, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, followed by edible, red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Elaeagnus parvifolia is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
