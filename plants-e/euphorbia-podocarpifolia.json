    "intro": "Euphorbia podocarpifolia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia podocarpifolia is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems to survive prolonged dry periods."
