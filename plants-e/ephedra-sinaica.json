    "intro": "Ephedra sinaica, commonly known as the Sinaitic ephedra, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adaptations to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and red-brown seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Ephedra sinaica contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. Due to its medicinal properties and ecological significance, it is an important species in its native habitats."
