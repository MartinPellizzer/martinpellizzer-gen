    "intro": "Euphorbia leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically white or pale green, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
