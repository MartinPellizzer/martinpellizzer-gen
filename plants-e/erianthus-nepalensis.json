It typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 meters and has long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Erianthus nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
