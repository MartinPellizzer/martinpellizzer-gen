    "intro": "Epidendrum papillosum, commonly known as the Papillate Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
