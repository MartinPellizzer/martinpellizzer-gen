    "intro": "Eucalyptus gracilis, commonly known as the slender ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in thin layers, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. Eucalyptus gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid environments."
