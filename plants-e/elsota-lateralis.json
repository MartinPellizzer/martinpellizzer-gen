    "intro": "Elsota lateralis, commonly known as the lateral elsa, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Elsota lateralis is considered a vulnerable species in its native ecosystems."
