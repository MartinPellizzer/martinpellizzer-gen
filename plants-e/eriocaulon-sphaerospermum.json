    "intro": "Eriocaulon sphaerospermum, commonly known as the globular spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, compact inflorescences that resemble small, rounded spikes, which are characteristic of the Eriocaulaceae family. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
