    "intro": "Eupatorium daleoides, commonly known as white boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, dry fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by wind. Eupatorium daleoides is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
