    "intro": "Eremaea ectadioclada, commonly known as the coastal eremaea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Eremaea ectadioclada is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes."
