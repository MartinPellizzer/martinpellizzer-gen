    "intro": "Echium cotinatum, commonly known as the common thimbleweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, thimble-shaped seed capsules that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and features blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Echium cotinatum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas."
