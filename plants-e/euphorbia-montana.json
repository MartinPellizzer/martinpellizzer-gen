    "intro": "Euphorbia montana, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia montana is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
