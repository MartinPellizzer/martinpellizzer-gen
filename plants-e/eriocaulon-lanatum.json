It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters at the base of the leafy stems. It is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. Eriocaulon lanatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
