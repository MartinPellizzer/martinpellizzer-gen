It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its basal leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as gravelly slopes and open woodlands. It produces small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its low-growing habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
