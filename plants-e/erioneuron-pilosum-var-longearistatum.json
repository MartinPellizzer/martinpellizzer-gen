    "intro": "Erioneuron pilosum var. longearistatum, commonly known as the long-haired erioneuron, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage, which provides insulation against harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is notable for its elongated, hairy leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
