    "intro": "Echinocactus capricornis var. niveus, commonly known as the Snowball Cactus, is a succulent native to the rocky areas of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and a covering of white, woolly spines that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to thrive. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to arid environments."
