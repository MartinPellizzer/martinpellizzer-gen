    "intro": "Echinocereus viridiflorus subsp. viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its greenish stems and spiny, cylindrical stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky, desert conditions with minimal water."
