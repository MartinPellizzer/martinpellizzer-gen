    "intro": "Euphorbia tirucalli, commonly known as the milk bush or Christian's staff, is a succulent shrub native to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching structure and its ability to store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap known as latex, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically small, spiny, or reduced to scales, depending on the variety. Euphorbia tirucalli is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
