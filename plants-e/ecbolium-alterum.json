    "intro": "Ecbolium alterum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, silvery-green leaves that reflect sunlight, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, blooming at night. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow berry that contains several seeds. Ecbolium alterum is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
