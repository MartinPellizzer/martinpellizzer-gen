    "intro": "Euphorbia demissa, commonly known as the pale spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, somewhat fleshy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
