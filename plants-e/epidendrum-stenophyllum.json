    "intro": "Epidendrum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum stenophyllum is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
