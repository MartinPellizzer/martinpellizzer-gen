It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and yellow-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
