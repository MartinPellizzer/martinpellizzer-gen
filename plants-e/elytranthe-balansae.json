    "intro": "Elytranthe balansae, commonly known as the Balansae elytranthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many tropical plants known for their vibrant flowers and water-storing leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The flowers, which are small and clustered, are usually a striking red or orange color, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
