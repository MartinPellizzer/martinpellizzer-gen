    "intro": "Euphorbia podagrica, commonly known as the blistering euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains irritants that can cause skin blisters, making it potentially hazardous to handle. Euphorbia podagrica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
