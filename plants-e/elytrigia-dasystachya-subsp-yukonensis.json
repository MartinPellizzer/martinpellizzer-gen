It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, and is adapted to cold climates. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wetland conservation."
