    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its stems are covered in small, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and historical use in traditional medicine."
