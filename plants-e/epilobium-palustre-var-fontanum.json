    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. fontanum, commonly known as the marsh willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in northern regions. It features slender, often reddish stems that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
