    "intro": "Elymus divaricatus subsp. lomatolepis, commonly known as the Sierra fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, which are a key identifying feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
