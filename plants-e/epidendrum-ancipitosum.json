    "intro": "Epidendrum ancipitosum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that are usually dark green with a waxy texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum ancipitosum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
