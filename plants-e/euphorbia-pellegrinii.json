    "intro": "Euphorbia pellegrinii, commonly known as the Pellegrini's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Euphorbia pellegrinii is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments."
