    "intro": "Eulophia arenaria, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It produces tall, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and bears clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can survive in low-nutrient environments. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is typical for many orchid species. Eulophia arenaria is often found in open habitats such as sand dunes and rocky outcrops."
