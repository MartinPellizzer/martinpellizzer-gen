    "intro": "Echinops spinosus subsp. fontqueri, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, globe-shaped crown and silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert and semi-desert habitats. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an important component of local ecosystems."
