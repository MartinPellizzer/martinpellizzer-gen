    "intro": "Echinocereus coccineus subsp. mojavensis, commonly known as the desert night bloomer or the Mojave prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and minimal water. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
