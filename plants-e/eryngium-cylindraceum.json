It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stem and blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Eryngium cylindraceum is valued in horticulture for its architectural form and long-lasting blooms."
