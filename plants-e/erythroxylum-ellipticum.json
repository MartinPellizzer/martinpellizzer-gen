    "intro": "Erythroxylum ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic erythroxylum, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, woody capsules containing the seeds. It is notable for its potential medicinal properties and has been studied for its alkaloid content. However, it is not closely related to the coca plant, despite some common misconceptions."
