    "intro": "Euonymus effusus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
