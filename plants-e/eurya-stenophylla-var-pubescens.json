    "intro": "Eurya stenophylla var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy-leaf eurya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
