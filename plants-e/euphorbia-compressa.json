    "intro": "Euphorbia compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, branching stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. Euphorbia compressa is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
