    "intro": "Ebenus sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
