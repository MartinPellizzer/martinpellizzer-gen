    "intro": "Euphorbia veneris, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in soft, velvety spines that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically spine-tipped and can vary in shape depending on environmental conditions. Euphorbia veneris is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
