    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 rigidum, commonly known as rigid willowherb, is a flowering plant in the evening primrose family (Onagraceae). It is characterized by its erect, glandular-stemmed growth and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils. Epilobium \u00d7 rigidum is sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
