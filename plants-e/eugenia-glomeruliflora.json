    "intro": "Eugenia glomeruliflora, commonly known as the clustered-flowered eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
