    "intro": "Euonymus sieboldianus f. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, elliptical, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species, giving it a more refined appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that persist into winter. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. This form is prized in horticulture for its dense foliage and seasonal color changes."
