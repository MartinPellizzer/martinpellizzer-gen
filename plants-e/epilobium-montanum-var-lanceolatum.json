    "intro": "Epilobium montanum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the mountain willow or narrow-leaved willow, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in racemes during the summer months. Its stems are often reddish and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
