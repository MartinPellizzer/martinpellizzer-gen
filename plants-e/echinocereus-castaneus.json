    "intro": "Echinocereus castaneus, commonly known as the orange hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in yellow to orange spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, typically at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Echinocereus castaneus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
