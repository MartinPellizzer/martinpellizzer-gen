It is a small, delicate plant with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Elaphoglossum fortipes is characterized by its ability to tolerate wet conditions and is often found in areas with consistent moisture."
