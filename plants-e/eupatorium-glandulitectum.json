It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in glandular hairs, giving the plant a sticky texture. The flowers are small, clustered in dense panicles, and typically bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
