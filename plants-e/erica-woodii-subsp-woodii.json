    "intro": "Erica woodii subsp. woodii, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
