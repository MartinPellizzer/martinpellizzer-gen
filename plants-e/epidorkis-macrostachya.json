    "intro": "Epidorkis macrostachya, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to two meters in height, bearing numerous fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and sturdy, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and often form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient absorption. Epidorkis macrostachya is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting diverse insect and bird populations."
