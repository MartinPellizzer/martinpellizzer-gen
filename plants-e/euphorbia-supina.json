    "intro": "Euphorbia supina, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance. Euphorbia supina is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and full sunlight."
