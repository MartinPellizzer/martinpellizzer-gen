    "intro": "Eleocharis bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia flatspike, is a species of sedge native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it forms dense stands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly rough texture, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis bahiensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
