    "intro": "Echinopsis decaisniana, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the surface during brief rainfalls. Its thick, waxy skin helps reduce water loss in harsh desert conditions. Echinopsis decaisniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
