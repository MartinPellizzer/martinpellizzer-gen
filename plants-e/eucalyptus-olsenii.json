    "intro": "Eucalyptus olsenii, commonly known as the yellow box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to yellowish bark that peels off in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from yellow to red, which attract a variety of native pollinators. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
