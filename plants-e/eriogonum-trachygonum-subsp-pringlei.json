It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, often grayish foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, hard, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats."
