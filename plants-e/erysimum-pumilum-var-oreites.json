    "intro": "Erysimum pumilum var. oreites, commonly known as the coastal rock cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of California and Baja California. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky slopes or along the edges of dunes. This variety is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of its coastal environment."
