    "intro": "Echium, commonly known as the \"hooded poppy,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often violet or blue, flowers that are typically borne on tall, slender stems. Echium species are native to Europe, Africa, and the Mediterranean region, with some species found in North America. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant colors and unique floral structures."
