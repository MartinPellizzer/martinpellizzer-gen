    "intro": "Euphorbia ceroderma, commonly known as the white spurge or false arrowhead, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Euphorbia ceroderma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
