    "intro": "Electra nitida, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support in arid environments. Electra nitida is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions."
