    "intro": "Eryngium erosum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-to-purple flower heads that are surrounded by stiff, bristly leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eryngium erosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
