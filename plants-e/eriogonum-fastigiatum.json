    "intro": "Eriogonum fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a grayish or whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum fastigiatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a common component of chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
