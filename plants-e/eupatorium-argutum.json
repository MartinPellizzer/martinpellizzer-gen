    "intro": "Eupatorium argutum, commonly known as roughleaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and opposite, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and stream banks. Eupatorium argutum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
