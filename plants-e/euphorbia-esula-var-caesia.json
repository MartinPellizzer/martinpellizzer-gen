    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. caesia, commonly known as the white-spined leaf euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that often have a white or pale greenish margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and can be found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
