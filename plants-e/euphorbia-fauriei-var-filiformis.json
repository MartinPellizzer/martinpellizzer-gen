It is characterized by its long, thin, branching stems that resemble delicate tendrils, often growing in a cascading or shrub-like form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish, surrounded by a crown of modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
