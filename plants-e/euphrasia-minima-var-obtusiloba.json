    "intro": "Euphrasia minima var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the blunt-leaf eyebright, is a small flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features delicate, upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that have a rounded base. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and borne in clusters, often with two lips that resemble the shape of an eyeball. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more obtuse leaf lobes compared to other forms of Euphrasia minima."
