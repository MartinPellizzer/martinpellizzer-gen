    "intro": "Eulophia alismatophylla, commonly known as the water lily orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that resemble those of water lilies, which help it thrive in moist or aquatic environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a complex structure typical of orchids, featuring a spurred lip and intricate petals. It is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds and rivers. Its botanical features make it an attractive and unique addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
