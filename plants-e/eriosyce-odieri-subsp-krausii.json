    "intro": "Eriosyce odieri subsp. krausii, commonly known as the Kraus\u2019s ghost cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white or pale green spines and short, cylindrical stems that often form a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
