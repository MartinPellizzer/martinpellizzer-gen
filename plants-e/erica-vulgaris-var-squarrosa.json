    "intro": "Erica vulgaris var. squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, hardy groundcover."
