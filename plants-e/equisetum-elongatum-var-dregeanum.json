    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. dregeanum, commonly known as the Drege's horse tail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are typically found near the ground level. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
