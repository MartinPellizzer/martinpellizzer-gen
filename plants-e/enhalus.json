    "intro": "Enhalus, commonly known as the seagrass, is a marine flowering plant that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves. Enhalus forms dense underwater meadows that provide essential habitat and nursery grounds for various marine species. The plant reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with flowering and seed production occurring in its life cycle. Its presence is an indicator of healthy marine ecosystems and plays a vital role in coastal biodiversity."
