    "intro": "Elynanthus sodalium, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Elynanthus sodalium thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it ecologically significant in its native habitats."
