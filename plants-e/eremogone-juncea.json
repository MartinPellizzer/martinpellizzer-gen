    "intro": "Eremogone juncea, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in environments with low precipitation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Eremogone juncea is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
