    "intro": "Erigeron oreophilus f. latilobus, commonly known as the mountain blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the higher elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is generally covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are blue to purple in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
