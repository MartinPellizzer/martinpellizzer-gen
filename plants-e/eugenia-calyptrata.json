    "intro": "Eugenia calyptrata, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. The species is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
