    "intro": "Endiandra wongawallanensis, commonly known as the Wongawallan endiandra, is a rare and endemic rainforest tree found in Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within subtropical and tropical rainforests. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a glossy surface that aids in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
