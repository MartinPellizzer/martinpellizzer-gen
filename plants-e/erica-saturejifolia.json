    "intro": "Erica saturejifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coasts of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It has needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact and rugged appearance. Erica saturejifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
