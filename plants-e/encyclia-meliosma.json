    "intro": "Encyclia meliosma, commonly known as the showy pineapple orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, pineapple-shaped inflorescence that displays a mix of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant produces dense, sword-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Encyclia meliosma is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
