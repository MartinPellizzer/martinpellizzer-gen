    "intro": "Eucalyptus brachycalyx var. protrusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically released in spring. Its leaves and flowers contain aromatic oils, making it a valuable species for both ecological and commercial purposes. This variety is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands."
