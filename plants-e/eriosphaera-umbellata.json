    "intro": "Eriosphaera umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella cholla, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure covered in small, spiny clusters of cylindrical stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne on short, lateral branches. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Eriosphaera umbellata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
