    "intro": "Elaphoglossum miniatum, commonly known as the miniature holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, often hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often overlooked species in botanical studies."
