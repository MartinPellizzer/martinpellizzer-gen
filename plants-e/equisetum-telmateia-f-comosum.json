    "intro": "Equisetum telmateia f. comosum, commonly known as the woolly horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its structure includes both sterile and fertile stems. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
