    "intro": "Eria elaticaulis, commonly known as the elastic-stemmed orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, flexible stems that allow it to sway with the wind, a feature that may aid in pollination or seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Eria elaticaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
