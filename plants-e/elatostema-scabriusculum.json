    "intro": "Elatostema scabriusculum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a rough texture due to their dense pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
