    "intro": "Eremopyxis camphorata, commonly known as the camphor tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, including South Africa, and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Eremopyxis camphorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
