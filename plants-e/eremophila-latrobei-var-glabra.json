    "intro": "Eremophila latrobei var. glabra, commonly known as the Smooth Eremophila, is a shrub native to Australia, particularly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of South Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often grey-green leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for low-water gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for native pollinators."
