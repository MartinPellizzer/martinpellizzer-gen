    "intro": "Eugenia stephanii, commonly known as the mountain guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It typically grows at high altitudes, often in cloud forests, and thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a pleasant aroma when crushed. Eugenia stephanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit."
