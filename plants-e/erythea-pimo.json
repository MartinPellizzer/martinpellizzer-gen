It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, dark red fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its rich, reddish color and fine grain. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
