    "intro": "Euthamia graminifolia var. hirtipes, commonly known as hairy goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, composite flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
