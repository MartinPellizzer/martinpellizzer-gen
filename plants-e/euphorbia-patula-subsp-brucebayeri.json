    "intro": "Euphorbia patula subsp. brucebayeri, commonly known as the Bruce Bayer euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
