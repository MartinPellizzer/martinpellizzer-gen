    "intro": "Erica caffra var. auricularis, commonly known as the Cape heath or auricular heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This species is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region, with drought tolerance and frost resistance."
