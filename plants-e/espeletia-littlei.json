    "intro": "Espeletia littlei, commonly known as the Little's espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its rosette growth form. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it survive in cold, arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and they bloom in the spring. Espeletia littlei is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
