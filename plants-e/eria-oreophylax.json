    "intro": "Eria oreophylax, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Eria oreophylax is considered a rare and endangered species."
