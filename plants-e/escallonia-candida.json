    "intro": "Escallonia candida, commonly known as the white escallonia, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and seasonal flowering make it a valuable addition to coastal and Mediterranean climates."
