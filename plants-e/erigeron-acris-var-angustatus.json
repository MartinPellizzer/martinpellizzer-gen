    "intro": "Erigeron acris var. angustatus, commonly known as narrowleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. It has linear to lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Erigeron acris."
