    "intro": "Eugenia coriacea, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or rough eugenia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves and small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. Eugenia coriacea thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
