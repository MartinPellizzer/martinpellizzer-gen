    "intro": "Elymus longearistatus, commonly known as the longawn wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat. Its foliage is often used in livestock forage due to its nutritional value and palatability. Elymus longearistatus is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high altitudes and arid climates."
