It is a member of the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to other forms of Erodium chium."
