    "intro": "Euphorbia granulata, commonly known as the granulate spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, rounded tubercles that give it a unique textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small and may be reduced or absent in some varieties, contributing to its spiny, shrub-like form. Euphorbia granulata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
