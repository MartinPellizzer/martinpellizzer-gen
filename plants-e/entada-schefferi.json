    "intro": "Entada schefferi, commonly known as the African rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often shed during the dry season. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in areas with seasonal rainfall. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate drought make it a useful species for reforestation and ornamental purposes. The tree's botanical features reflect its adaptation to the diverse environmental conditions of its native habitat."
