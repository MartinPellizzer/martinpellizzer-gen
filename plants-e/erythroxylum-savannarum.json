    "intro": "Erythroxylum savannarum, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and open areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in ecosystems outside its native range."
