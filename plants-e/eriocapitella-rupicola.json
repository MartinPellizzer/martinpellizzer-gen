    "intro": "Eriocapitella rupicola, commonly known as the rock ericoid, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or on rocky outcrops. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
