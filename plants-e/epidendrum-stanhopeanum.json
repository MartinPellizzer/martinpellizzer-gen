    "intro": "Epidendrum stanhopeanum, commonly known as the Stanhope's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and violet. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Epidendrum stanhopeanum is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
