    "intro": "Echinocactus horizonthalonius subsp. australis, commonly known as the Desert Rose or the Mexican Hat, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in prominent, bright green spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
