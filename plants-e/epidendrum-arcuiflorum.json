    "intro": "Epidendrum arcuiflorum, commonly known as the curved-flower epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, arching stems that bear clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers, which are typically fragrant. Its leaves are strap-shaped and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens or greenhouses. Epidendrum arcuiflorum is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive."
