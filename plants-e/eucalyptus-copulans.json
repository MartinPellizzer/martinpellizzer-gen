    "intro": "Eucalyptus copulans, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it grows in moist, subtropical rainforests. The tree is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
