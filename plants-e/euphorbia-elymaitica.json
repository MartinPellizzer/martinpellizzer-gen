    "intro": "Euphorbia elymaitica, commonly known as the Erythraean spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
