    "intro": "Eugenia formosa, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
