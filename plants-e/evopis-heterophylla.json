    "intro": "Evopis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits distinct variations in leaf shape and size across different environmental conditions. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically green to yellowish in color and composed of a complex interwoven structure of fungal hyphae and algal cells. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Its morphological plasticity allows it to adapt to a range of microhabitats, making it a common indicator species in ecological studies. The lichen's ability to absorb and retain moisture contributes to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization."
