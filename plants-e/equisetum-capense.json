    "intro": "Equisetum capense, commonly known as the Cape horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, segmented stem. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. It produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are important for its reproductive cycle. Equisetum capense is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and wind."
