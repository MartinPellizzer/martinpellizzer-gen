    "intro": "Ebenus lancea, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Ebenus lancea is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
