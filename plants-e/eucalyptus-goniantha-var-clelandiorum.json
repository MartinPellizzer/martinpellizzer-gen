    "intro": "Eucalyptus goniantha var. clelandiorum, commonly known as the Cleland's mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped, narrow leaves. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. This variety is known for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
