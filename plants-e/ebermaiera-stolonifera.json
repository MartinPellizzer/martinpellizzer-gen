    "intro": "Ebermaiera stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous evergreen, is a tropical plant characterized by its creeping growth habit and dense foliage. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its stolons allow it to spread horizontally, forming thick mats that can cover the ground. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in moist, tropical conditions."
