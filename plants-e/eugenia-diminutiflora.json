    "intro": "Eugenia diminutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf flame tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. These flowers are followed by small, round, red or orange fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Eugenia diminutiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
