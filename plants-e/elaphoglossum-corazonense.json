    "intro": "Elaphoglossum corazonense, commonly known as the Coraz\u00f3n fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Elaphoglossum corazonense plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
