The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and are usually greenish-white in color. The species is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
