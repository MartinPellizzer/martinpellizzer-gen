    "intro": "Eriogonum kelloggii, commonly known as Kellogg's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescence and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which help reduce water loss. Kellogg's buckwheat is often found in open areas such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
