    "intro": "Echinocactus undulatus, commonly known as the Mexican sunburst cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered with spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
