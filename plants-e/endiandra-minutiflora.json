It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. The plant has elliptical, glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is often dispersed by animals. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
