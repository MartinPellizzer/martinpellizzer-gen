    "intro": "Erica albescens var. albescens, commonly known as the white heath, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand the region's dry summers. The species is well-suited to acidic, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
