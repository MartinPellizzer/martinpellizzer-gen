    "intro": "Epilobium alsinoides, commonly known as narrow-leaf willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Epilobium alsinoides is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat skin conditions and as a diuretic."
