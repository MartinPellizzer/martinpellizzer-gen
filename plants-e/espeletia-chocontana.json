    "intro": "Espeletia chocontana, commonly known as the Choconta heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. Espeletia chocontana typically grows in open, rocky areas and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying shades of white, yellow, or red."
