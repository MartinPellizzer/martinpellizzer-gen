    "intro": "Epiphyllum eichlamii, commonly known as the moon cactus or night bloomer, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a type of cactus that grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without being parasitic. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, segmented stems and produces large, showy flowers that open at night. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and have a strong fragrance. Epiphyllum eichlamii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
