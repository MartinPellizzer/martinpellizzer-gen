    "intro": "Eryngium humile var. typicum, commonly known as the common thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, surrounded by a series of bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
