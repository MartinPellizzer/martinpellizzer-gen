    "intro": "Elatostema monandrum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false arum, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive, deeply lobed or pinnatifid margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense, spadix-like inflorescences, a feature common in the Araceae family, though it is actually classified under Urticaceae. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique texture and appearance."
