    "intro": "Epidendrum orgyale, commonly known as the Orchid of the Gods, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can reach several feet in length, bearing numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Epidendrum orgyale is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine in some regions."
