    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale, commonly known as the sea horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum hyemale and Equisetum palustre. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant features a slender, jointed stem with whorls of small, needle-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem. Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions make it an important species in coastal ecology. Equisetum \u00d7 litorale plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
