    "intro": "Eriachne major, commonly known as the tall grass bristle grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eriachne major is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
