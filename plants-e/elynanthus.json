    "intro": "Elynanthus, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, consists of various species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and pea-like flowers. They are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in their root nodules. Elynanthus species often thrive in well-drained soils and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Their seeds are usually enclosed in pods and can be dispersed by wind or animals."
