    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca var. tegetiforme, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
