It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its scientific name reflects the five nerves in its leaf veins, a key botanical feature."
