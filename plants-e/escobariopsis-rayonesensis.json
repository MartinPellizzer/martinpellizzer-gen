    "intro": "Escobariopsis rayonesensis, commonly known as the Rayones' cushion lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, foliose growth form, forming compact, cushion-like structures on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to greenish in color, with a smooth upper surface and a more granular lower surface. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. This lichen is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and potential role in ecological indicator studies."
