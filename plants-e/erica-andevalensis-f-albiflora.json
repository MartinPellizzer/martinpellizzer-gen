    "intro": "Erica andevalensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered heath, is a rare and striking variant of the Erica andevalensis species. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain, particularly in the Sierra de Andaluc\u00eda. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its profusion of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its habitat. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique floral characteristics and limited distribution."
