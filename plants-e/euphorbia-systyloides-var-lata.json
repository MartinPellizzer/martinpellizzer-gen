    "intro": "Euphorbia systyloides var. lata, commonly known as the broad-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions. The plant is noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
