    "intro": "Erica oresigena var. oresigena, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with dense, wiry stems covered in small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica oresigena var. oresigena is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
