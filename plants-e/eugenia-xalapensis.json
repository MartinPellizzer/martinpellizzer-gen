    "intro": "Eugenia xalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican huito, is a small evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are followed by edible, yellowish-orange berries. These berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to their mild, sweet taste. Eugenia xalapensis thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade."
