    "intro": "Elaphoglossum semicylindricum, commonly known as the narrow-cylindrical holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it a notable species within its native range."
