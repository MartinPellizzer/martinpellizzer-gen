    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 nelsonii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum ramosissimum. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stems, typical of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain environments."
