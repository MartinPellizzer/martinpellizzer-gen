    "intro": "Epigeneium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed epigeneium, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its elongated, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by berries that range in color from red to yellow. Epigeneium longipes is often found in moist, shaded forest understories where it uses its tendrils to climb toward light. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
