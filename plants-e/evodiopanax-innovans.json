    "intro": "Evodiopanax innovans, commonly known as the Guangxi arrowleaf, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Guangxi, China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowering and fruiting habits are not well-documented, but it is believed to produce small, clustered flowers followed by berry-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited research, Evodiopanax innovans remains a poorly understood species in botanical science."
