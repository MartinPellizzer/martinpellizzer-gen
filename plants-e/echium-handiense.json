    "intro": "Echium handiense, commonly known as the Canary Island thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echium handiense is also noted for its tall, spiny stems and its role in supporting local pollinators."
