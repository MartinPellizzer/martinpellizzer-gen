    "intro": "Euphorbia citrina, commonly known as the yellow spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. Euphorbia citrina is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
