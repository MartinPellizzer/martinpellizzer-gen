    "intro": "Eucalyptus flocktoniae, commonly known as the Flockton's malleable, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flowers that are usually pale green to yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus flocktoniae is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to shed leaves during drought. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects."
