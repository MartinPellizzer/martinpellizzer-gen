    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. triangulare, commonly known as the triangular field horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of triangular, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments such as wetlands and disturbed soils. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in certain conditions."
