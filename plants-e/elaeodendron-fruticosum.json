    "intro": "Elaeodendron fruticosum, commonly known as the African silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies primarily in its ecological role within its native habitat."
