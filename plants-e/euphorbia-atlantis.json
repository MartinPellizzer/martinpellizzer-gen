    "intro": "Euphorbia atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantis spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is smooth and often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called a pruina. Euphorbia atlantis is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
