It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in dense panicles, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
