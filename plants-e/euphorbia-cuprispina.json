    "intro": "Euphorbia cuprispina, commonly known as the copper-spined euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts, giving it a striking appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia cuprispina is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
