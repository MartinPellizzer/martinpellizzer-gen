    "intro": "Eucalyptus viminalis subsp. cygnetensis, commonly known as the Cygnet gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
