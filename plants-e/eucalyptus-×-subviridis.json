It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus \u00d7 subviridis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system. Its leaves and essential oils have been used in traditional medicine and for their aromatic properties."
