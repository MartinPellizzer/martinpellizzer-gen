    "intro": "Euphorbia seemannii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Due to its toxic milky sap, it should be handled with care."
