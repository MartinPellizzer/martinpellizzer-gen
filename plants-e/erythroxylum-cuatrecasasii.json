    "intro": "Erythroxylum cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It is often found in cloud forests at high elevations, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
