    "intro": "Eritrichium spathulatum, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its growth habit and appearance make it a distinctive member of the Boraginaceae family. Eritrichium spathulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
