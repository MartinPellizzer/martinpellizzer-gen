    "intro": "Eurylepis halicacaba, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant is well adapted to saline and wind-prone environments, making it a hardy coastal species."
