    "intro": "Epidendrum sympodiale, commonly known as the sympodial epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, where the plant produces new shoots from the base of the stem rather than from the tip. The plant typically has strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and can be found in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Epidendrum sympodiale is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
