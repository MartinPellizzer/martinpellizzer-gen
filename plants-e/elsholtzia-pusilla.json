    "intro": "Elsholtzia pusilla, commonly known as dwarf elsholtzia, is a small, perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with compact, aromatic foliage that often has a grayish-blue hue. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its medicinal properties have been noted in traditional herbal practices, though further scientific study is needed to confirm its efficacy."
