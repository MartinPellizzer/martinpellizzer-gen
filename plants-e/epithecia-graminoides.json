    "intro": "Epithecia graminoides, commonly known as the grass-like lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure. It forms a dense, greenish to yellowish thallus that resembles grass in appearance, hence its common name. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on soil or rock surfaces. Its morphology is characterized by a flattened, leafy structure with a complex network of hyphae."
