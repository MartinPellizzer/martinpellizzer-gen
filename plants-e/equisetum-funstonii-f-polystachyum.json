    "intro": "Equisetum funstonii f. polystachyum, commonly known as the Funston's horse tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a distinctive, spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its primitive morphology reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
