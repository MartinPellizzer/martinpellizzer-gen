    "intro": "Euphlebium spurium, commonly known as the red spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive reddish-barked trunk, which becomes more pronounced with age. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and its needles are typically short and dark green. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with acidic soils. Euphlebium spurium plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
