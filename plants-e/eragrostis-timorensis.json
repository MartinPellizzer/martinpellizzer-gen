    "intro": "Eragrostis timorensis, commonly known as Timor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Timor. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control in tropical regions."
