    "intro": "Eragrostis indica, commonly known as Indian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. Eragrostis indica is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
