    "intro": "Euchylia nigra, commonly known as black euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common feature among the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
