    "intro": "Euphorbia fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Euphorbia fraseri is also known for its ability to store water in its leaves and stems, allowing it to survive in dry conditions."
