    "intro": "Elatine pedicellaris, commonly known as the small waterwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Elatinaceae. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branched stems that are often submerged, with tiny, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter in length. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed aquatic habitats. Elatine pedicellaris is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
