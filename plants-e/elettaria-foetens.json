    "intro": "Elettaria foetens, commonly known as wild cardamom, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing aromatic seeds. The seeds, though not as commercially valuable as those of Elettaria cardamomum, are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its botanical features make it a close relative of the widely cultivated cardamom plant."
