    "intro": "Elymus glabriflorus, commonly known as the smoothflower wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and have a soft, bluish-green appearance. Elymus glabriflorus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging environments."
