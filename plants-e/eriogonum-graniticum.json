    "intro": "Eriogonum graniticum, commonly known as the granitic spirea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum graniticum is often found in open habitats such as slopes, gravelly plains, and disturbed areas."
