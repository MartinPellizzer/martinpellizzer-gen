    "intro": "Eriogonum effusum, commonly known as the woolly buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, including slopes and open woodlands. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Eriogonum effusum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
