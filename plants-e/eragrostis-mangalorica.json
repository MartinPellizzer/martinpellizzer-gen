    "intro": "Eragrostis mangalorica, commonly known as the Mangalore grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern India. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to saline environments, making it a common sight in mangrove areas. Eragrostis mangalorica plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
