    "intro": "Erodium cyrenaicum, commonly known as seaside catchfly, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, pink or purple flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or coastal soils and thrives in well-drained environments. It has a low-growing habit and is often found in disturbed areas along the shoreline. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new habitats."
