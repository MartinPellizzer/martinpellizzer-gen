    "intro": "Eurystylus flaccidus, commonly known as the soft-styled orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that hang from long, slender stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with a faintly colored lip. Despite its beauty, it is a rare and less-studied species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
