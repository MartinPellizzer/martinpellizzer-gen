    "intro": "Euphorbia ocellata subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by spiny bracts. Its leaves are typically small and may be reduced or absent in some varieties, further enhancing its drought tolerance. Euphorbia ocellata subsp. arenicola is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
