    "intro": "Euterpe brachyclada, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a species of palm native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, slender palm that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish bloom. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of other Euterpe species. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
