    "intro": "Eruca stenocarpa, commonly known as narrowpod wallcress, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant features small, green, lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into narrow, elongated pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in rocky areas. Eruca stenocarpa is often considered a weed but has potential for use in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
