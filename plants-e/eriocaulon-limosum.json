    "intro": "Eriocaulon limosum, commonly known as the swamp ricegrass, is a small aquatic or semiaquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the substrate. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged environments. Eriocaulon limosum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
