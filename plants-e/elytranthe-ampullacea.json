    "intro": "Elytranthe ampullacea, commonly known as the bottlebrush plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Elytranthe ampullacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
