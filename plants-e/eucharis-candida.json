    "intro": "Eucharis candida, commonly known as the white elephant orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Aroid family, which includes many tropical plants with showy inflorescences. The plant features a thick, short stem with a cluster of broad, waxy, dark green leaves. Its flowers are white and resemble orchids, with a central spadix surrounded by a white spathe. Eucharis candida is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
