    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium f. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length, giving it its distinguishing name. The plant produces tiny, pink or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in some regions."
