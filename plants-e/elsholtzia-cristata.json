    "intro": "Elsholtzia cristata, commonly known as the crested germander, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its unique, crested appearance is due to the dense growth of its foliage. Elsholtzia cristata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
