    "intro": "Equisetum huegelii var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf scottish horse-tail, is a diminutive fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are typically less than 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are a defining feature of the genus Equisetum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical traits."
