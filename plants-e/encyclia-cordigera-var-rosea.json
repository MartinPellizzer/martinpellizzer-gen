    "intro": "Encyclia cordigera var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered pineapple orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to rose, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
