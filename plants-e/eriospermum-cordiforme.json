It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. It is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
