    "intro": "Echinopsilon sedoides var. pentandrus, commonly known as the five-angled echinops, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a distinctive, spiny fruit capsule that becomes more pronounced as it matures. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators."
