    "intro": "Eucalyptus ewartiana, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green color with a waxy coating. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
