    "intro": "Epipactis troodi, commonly known as the slender helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a spadix of small, greenish flowers. Epipactis troodi is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often associated with specific fungal symbioses."
