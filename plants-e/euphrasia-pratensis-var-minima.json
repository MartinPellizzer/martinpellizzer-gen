    "intro": "Euphrasia pratensis var. minima, commonly known as the lesser eyebright, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, reaching a height of only a few centimeters. The plant features tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its glandular leaves and short, erect stems. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
