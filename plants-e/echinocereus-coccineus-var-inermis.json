    "intro": "Echinocereus coccineus var. inermis, commonly known as the naked red prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is notable for its lack of glochids, making it less irritating to handle compared to other cacti in the same genus."
