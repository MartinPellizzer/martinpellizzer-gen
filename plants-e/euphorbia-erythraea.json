    "intro": "Euphorbia erythraea, commonly known as the red torch euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its spiny stems and vibrant red bracts that resemble torches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Due to its striking appearance, it is popular in ornamental gardening, though it requires careful handling due to its toxic sap."
