    "intro": "Elaeodendron pininsulare subsp. pininsulare, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like leaves and its tall, slender trunk that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, adapting well to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
