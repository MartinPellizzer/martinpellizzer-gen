    "intro": "Euphorbia scarlatina, commonly known as the scarlet spurge, is a striking succulent native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often tinged with red or orange, giving it a vibrant appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. However, it contains toxic sap, so caution is advised when handling it."
