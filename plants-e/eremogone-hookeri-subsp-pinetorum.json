    "intro": "Eremogone hookeri subsp. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest eremogone, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
