    "intro": "Epidendrum diothonaeoides, commonly known as the Mexican Ghost Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
