It belongs to the Ericaceae family, characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erica borbonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing rocky and coastal landscapes."
