    "intro": "Elaeocarpus bokorensis, commonly known as the Bokore ebony, is a tropical tree native to the forests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by dark purple or black fruits, which contain one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
