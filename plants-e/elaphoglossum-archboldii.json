    "intro": "Elaphoglossum archboldii, commonly known as the Archbold's holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum archboldii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
