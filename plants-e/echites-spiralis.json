    "intro": "Echites spiralis, commonly known as spiral sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive spiraling arrangement of its flowering spikes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Echites spiralis thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
