    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus var. rosei, commonly known as the rose-thorned hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial cactus characterized by its cylindrical stems and dense, pale pink to rose-colored spines. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are usually yellow or orange, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
