    "intro": "Epipactis palustris f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy purple or violet flower with a distinctive, hooded lip. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. This orchid is considered rare and is protected in many regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
