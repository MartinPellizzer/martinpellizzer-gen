    "intro": "Epigynum curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's epigynum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant features a short stem with broad, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and are usually white or pale yellow in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epigynum curtisii is considered a rare and endangered species."
