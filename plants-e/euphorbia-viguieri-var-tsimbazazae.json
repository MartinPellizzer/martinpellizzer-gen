It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
