    "intro": "Espeletia rigida, commonly known as the rigid heath, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in the dry, cold conditions of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Espeletia rigida plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine regions."
