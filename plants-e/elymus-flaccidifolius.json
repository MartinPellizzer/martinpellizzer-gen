    "intro": "Elymus flaccidifolius, commonly known as the flaccid-leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Elymus flaccidifolius is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
