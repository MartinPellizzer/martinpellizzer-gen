    "intro": "Erythrina speciosa var. rosea, commonly known as the rose flame tree, is a tropical ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to rose-red bracteate inflorescences that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain flat, winged seeds, typical of the legume family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates. The rose flame tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, enhancing fertility for surrounding plants."
