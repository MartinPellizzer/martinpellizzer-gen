It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often lobed or divided, which help it retain water in humid conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces small, fleshy berries as fruit. Elatostema trichosanthum is part of the family Urticaceae, which includes other plants with similar adaptive traits."
