    "intro": "Elymus semicostatus var. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often densely arranged along the stems, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
