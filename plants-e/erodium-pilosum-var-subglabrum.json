    "intro": "Erodium pilosum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically features small, pink to purple flowers and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture in its typical form, though the varietal form subglabrum is characterized by its smoother, less hairy foliage. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
