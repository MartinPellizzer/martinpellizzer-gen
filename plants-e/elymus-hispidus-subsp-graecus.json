    "intro": "Elymus hispidus subsp. graecus, commonly known as Greek wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its scientific name \"hispidus.\" It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
