    "intro": "Euphorbia watanabei subsp. minamitanii, commonly known as the Okinawan spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It features distinctive, fleshy, spiny stems and leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
