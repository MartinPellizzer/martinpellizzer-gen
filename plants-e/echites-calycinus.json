    "intro": "Echites calycinus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes other vine-like plants."
