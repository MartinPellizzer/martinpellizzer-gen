    "intro": "Echinochloa muricata var. wiegandii, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread aggressively in wetland and disturbed soils. This species is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to fluctuating water levels."
