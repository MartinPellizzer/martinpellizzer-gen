    "intro": "Epigeneium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu epigeneium, is a climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive inflorescence. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in the rainforests of Mount Kinabalu. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, with a spathe that resembles a leaf. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
