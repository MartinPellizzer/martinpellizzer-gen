    "intro": "Erythropalum populifolium, commonly known as the red-leaf poplar, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking red color in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a faintly aromatic scent. Erythropalum populifolium is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests."
