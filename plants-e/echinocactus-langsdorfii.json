It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and prominent, spine-tipped areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
