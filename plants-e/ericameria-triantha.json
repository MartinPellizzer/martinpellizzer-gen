    "intro": "Ericameria triantha, commonly known as the silverleaf erica, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often found in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are silvery-gray, providing a striking contrast to the green foliage of surrounding plants. Ericameria triantha is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
