    "intro": "Echium exasperatum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and leaves, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Echium exasperatum plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
