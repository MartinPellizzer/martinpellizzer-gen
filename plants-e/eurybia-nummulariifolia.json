    "intro": "Eurybia nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Eurybia nummulariifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
