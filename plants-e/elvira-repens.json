    "intro": "Elvira repens, commonly known as creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Elvira repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks."
