    "intro": "Eriogonum saxatile var. bloomeri, commonly known as the Bloomer\u2019s buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
