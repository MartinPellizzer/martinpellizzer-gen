    "intro": "Erepsia gracilis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Erepsia gracilis is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
