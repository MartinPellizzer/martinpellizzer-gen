It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant's leaves are often covered in tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its unique adaptations make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
