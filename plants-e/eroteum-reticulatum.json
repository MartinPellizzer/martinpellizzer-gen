    "intro": "Eroteum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate net-like veining on the petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. The flowers bloom in early spring and are pollinated primarily by specific insect species."
