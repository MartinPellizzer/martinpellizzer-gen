    "intro": "Ericoides spicatum, commonly known as the spike heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in tight clusters. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Ericoides spicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or eroded areas."
