    "intro": "Euphrasia pumilio, commonly known as the snow drop, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It produces delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils. Euphrasia pumilio is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic or semi-parasitic species."
