    "intro": "Elatostematoides manillensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved elatostema, is a member of the Elatostemaceae family. It is a terrestrial, leafy plant characterized by its small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant typically has a short, creeping or ascending stem and produces small, white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which may help in reducing water loss. This variant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
