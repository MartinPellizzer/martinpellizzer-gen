    "intro": "Erica insulsa, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western coast of Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. Erica insulsa has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
