    "intro": "Exocarpos humifusus, commonly known as the groundsel box or coastal box, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, followed by small, round, orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Exocarpos humifusus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
