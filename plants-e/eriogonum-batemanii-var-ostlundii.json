    "intro": "Eriogonum batemanii var. ostlundii, commonly known as the Ostlund's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is notable for its ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
