    "intro": "Epilobium roseum, commonly known as the pink willow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features slender, willow-like stems covered in fine, silky hairs. Its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Epilobium roseum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
