    "intro": "Epidendrum rubioi, commonly known as the Orange-flowered Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant orange petals and showy floral display. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Epidendrum rubioi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
