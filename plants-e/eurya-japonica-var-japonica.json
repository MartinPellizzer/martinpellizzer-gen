    "intro": "Eurya japonica var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese holly, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, oval, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often consumed by birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The berries are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
