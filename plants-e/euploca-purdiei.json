    "intro": "Euploca purdiei, commonly known as the mountain bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dense, bottle-shaped clusters of red flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, rainforest habitat. It grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understorey of rainforests. Euploca purdiei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
