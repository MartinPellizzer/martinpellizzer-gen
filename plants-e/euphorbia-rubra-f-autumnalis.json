    "intro": "Euphorbia rubra f. autumnalis, commonly known as the Autumnal Spurge, is a compact, succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking red-pink bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant autumn coloration, which adds visual interest to gardens throughout the fall season."
