    "intro": "Eugenia exaltata, commonly known as the wax apple or Surinam cherry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn red when mature, with a waxy, shiny skin and a sweet, tangy flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. Eugenia exaltata is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
