    "intro": "Ervatamia petelotii, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique and rare evergreen tree native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and its long, slender, bluish-green needles that grow in clusters. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of resilience in its harsh environment. It is also notable for its specialized adaptations to the arid climate, including a deep root system and thick, waxy leaves. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
