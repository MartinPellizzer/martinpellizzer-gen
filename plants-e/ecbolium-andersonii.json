    "intro": "Ecbolium andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. Ecbolium andersonii is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a specific microclimate to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
