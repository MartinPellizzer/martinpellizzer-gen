    "intro": "Eulophia tristis, commonly known as the sad orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often blooming in the spring. Eulophia tristis is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a unique and relatively rare species within the orchid family."
