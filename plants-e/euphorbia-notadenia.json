    "intro": "Euphorbia notadenia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
