The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of many sedges. Eleocharis brevicollis is often found in shallow water or moist soil, playing a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its presence indicates healthy aquatic habitats and contributes to biodiversity in these environments."
