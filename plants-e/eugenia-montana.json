    "intro": "Eugenia montana, commonly known as the mountain eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid regions of South America. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a fragrant, white flower cluster that blooms in the spring. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red as it matures. Eugenia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
