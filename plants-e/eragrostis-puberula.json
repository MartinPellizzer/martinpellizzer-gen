    "intro": "Eragrostis puberula, commonly known as slender weeping grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, silky appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, drooping panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers. Eragrostis puberula is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
