    "intro": "Erica articularis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica articularis thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
