    "intro": "Erythroxylum cuneifolium var. squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrosum coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its leaves contain alkaloids, including cocaine, which makes it significant in both botanical and ethnobotanical contexts. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates."
