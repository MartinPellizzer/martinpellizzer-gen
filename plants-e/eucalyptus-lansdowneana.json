    "intro": "Eucalyptus lansdowneana, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often aromatic. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its timber is valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its ecological importance in native habitats."
