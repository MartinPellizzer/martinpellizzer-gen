    "intro": "Epidendrum atropurpureum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the Purple-veined Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet and purple flower spikes, which often bear fragrant, showy blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
