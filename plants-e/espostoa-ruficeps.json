    "intro": "Espostoa ruficeps, commonly known as the red-headed cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy plant for xerophytic gardens. The species is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
