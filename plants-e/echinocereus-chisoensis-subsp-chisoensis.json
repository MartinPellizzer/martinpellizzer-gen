It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that are typically yellow to brown in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
