    "intro": "Epipactis campeadorii, commonly known as the Campeador orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, often in areas with rich, well-drained soil. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive greenish-yellow lip. Its pollination is primarily carried out by specific bee species, which are attracted to its unique floral structure. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
