    "intro": "Euphorbia ellipsifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Euphorbia ellipsifolia is also noted for its ability to tolerate drought conditions and its low maintenance requirements."
