It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and clusters of small, showy white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
