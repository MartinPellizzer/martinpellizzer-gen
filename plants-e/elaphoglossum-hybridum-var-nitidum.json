    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hybridum var. nitidum, commonly known as the shining maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant features small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, giving them a glossy appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. The fronds are often biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second."
