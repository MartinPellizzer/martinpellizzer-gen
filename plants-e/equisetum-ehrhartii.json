It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, spore-producing structures called strobili. The plant has a distinctive appearance with whorls of needle-like leaves along its stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Equisetum ehrhartii is a primitive plant that has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
