    "intro": "Eragrostis horizontalis, commonly known as silky blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and dense, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Eragrostis horizontalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
