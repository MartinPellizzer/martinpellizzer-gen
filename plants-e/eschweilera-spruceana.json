    "intro": "Eschweilera spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's eschweilera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in humid, lowland forests and is often found in association with other understory plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
