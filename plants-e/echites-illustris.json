    "intro": "Echites illustris, commonly known as the showy echites, is a striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in dense, umbrella-like clusters. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Echites illustris is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
