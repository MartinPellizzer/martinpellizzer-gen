    "intro": "Eriogonum nidularium var. luciense, commonly known as the Sierra goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. This plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecosystem biodiversity."
