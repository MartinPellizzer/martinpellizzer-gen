    "intro": "Elymus borealis var. scandicus, commonly known as the northern basket grass, is a perennial grass native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers in the summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its aesthetic appeal in natural landscapes."
