    "intro": "Elaphoglossum macrophyllum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, large, and leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical climates."
