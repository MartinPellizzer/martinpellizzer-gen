    "intro": "Euphorbia tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with a distinctive three-lobed shape at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax. Euphorbia tricuspidata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive drought conditions."
