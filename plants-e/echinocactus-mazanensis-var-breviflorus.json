    "intro": "Echinocactus mazanensis var. breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in thick, ribbed segments and bright green to blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
