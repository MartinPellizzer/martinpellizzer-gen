    "intro": "Elytrigia firmiculmis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
