    "intro": "Epidendrum lirion, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble a pink slipper, with a unique pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The orchid blooms in the summer, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
