    "intro": "Eucalyptus clavigera var. dallachiana, commonly known as the Dallachy's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular and have a distinctive blue-green hue. The flowers are typically white or cream, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This variant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
