    "intro": "Endiandra jonesii, commonly known as the Jones' endiandra, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are often visited by various pollinators, including bees and birds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional carpentry. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
