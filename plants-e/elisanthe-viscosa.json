    "intro": "Elisanthe viscosa, commonly known as sticky elisanthe, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and water-storing tissues. Elisanthe viscosa is often found in rocky soils and is a component of local flora in its native habitat."
