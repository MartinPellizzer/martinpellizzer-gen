    "intro": "Ephemerantha stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped ephemera, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the rainy season. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in shaded forest understories. Its blooming period is short-lived, making it a challenging species to study and cultivate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
