    "intro": "Eleusine digitata, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly used in traditional medicine. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist environments. Eleusine digitata is also valued as a forage crop for livestock in certain regions."
