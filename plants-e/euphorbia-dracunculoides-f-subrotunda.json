    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides f. subrotunda, commonly known as the broad-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically rounded or slightly heart-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are borne on short, branched stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
