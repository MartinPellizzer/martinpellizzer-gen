    "intro": "Erythroxylum wightii, commonly known as the Wight's coca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is notable for its historical and cultural significance, particularly in traditional Andean societies. However, it is not related to the coca plant used in the production of cocaine."
