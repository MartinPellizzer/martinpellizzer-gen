    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudovirgata, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to arid landscapes."
