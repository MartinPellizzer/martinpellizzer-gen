    "intro": "Elaeagnus angustifolia, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-green leaves and small, yellowish-green berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions, making it a hardy species. Its fragrant flowers are typically borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has been used traditionally for its ornamental value and in some regions for its edible fruits."
