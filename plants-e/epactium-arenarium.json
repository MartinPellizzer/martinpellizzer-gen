    "intro": "Epactium arenarium, commonly known as sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky habitats in Europe. It typically features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Its adaptations to harsh conditions include a deep root system and the ability to survive in poor soil. Epactium arenarium is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and other dry, well-drained areas."
