    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. triticoides, commonly known as sand wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
