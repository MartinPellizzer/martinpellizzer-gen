    "intro": "Erica unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the summer months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica unilateralis is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
