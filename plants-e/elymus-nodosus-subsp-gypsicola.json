    "intro": "Elymus nodosus subsp. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum jointgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant typically grows on well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish hues. This subspecies is adapted to high salinity and drought conditions, making it an important component of xerophytic vegetation."
