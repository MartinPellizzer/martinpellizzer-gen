    "intro": "Elaeagnus, commonly known as silverberry, is a genus of deciduous and evergreen shrubs or small trees native to temperate and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its silvery foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white, followed by edible berries that range in color from yellow to red. Elaeagnus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them useful in reclamation projects. They are also valued for their hardy nature and adaptability to various soil conditions."
