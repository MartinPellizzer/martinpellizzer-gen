    "intro": "Euphorbia anthonyi var. clarionensis, commonly known as the Clarion euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States, particularly found in Texas and New Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain water in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness. However, it contains toxic sap, so care should be taken when handling it."
