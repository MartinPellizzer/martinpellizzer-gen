    "intro": "Epilobium glaberrimum var. fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often nitrogen-rich soils, such as those found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly so. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and are pollinated by insects. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
