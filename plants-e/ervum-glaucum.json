    "intro": "Ervum glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in slender pods and are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Ervum glaucum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
