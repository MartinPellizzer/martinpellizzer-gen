    "intro": "Eucalyptus angulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, angular leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The bark of Eucalyptus angulosa is often flaky and peels away in thin layers, revealing a smooth, pale underbark."
