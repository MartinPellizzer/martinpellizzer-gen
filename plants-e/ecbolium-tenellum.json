    "intro": "Ecbolium tenellum, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract various pollinators. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Ecbolium tenellum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
