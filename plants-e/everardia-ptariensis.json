    "intro": "Everardia ptariensis, commonly known as the Cape York hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are woody and erect. Everardia ptariensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
