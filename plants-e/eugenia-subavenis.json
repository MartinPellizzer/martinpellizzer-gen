    "intro": "Eugenia subavenis, commonly known as the silver-leafed eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, silver-green leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or purple when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical gardens. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in warmer climates."
