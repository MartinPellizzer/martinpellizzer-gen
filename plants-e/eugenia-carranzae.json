    "intro": "Eugenia carranzae, commonly known as the Carranza's guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and elliptical, glossy leaves. Its fruit, similar to a guava, is typically small and edible, though less commonly cultivated than other guava species. Eugenia carranzae plays a role in local ecosystems and has potential for use in horticulture and traditional medicine."
