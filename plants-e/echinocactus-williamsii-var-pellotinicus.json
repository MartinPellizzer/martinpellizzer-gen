    "intro": "Echinocactus williamsii var. pellotinicus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of golden-yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant."
