It features striking red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a contrasting yellow or green throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture to retain moisture. Epidendrum rhodanthum is prized in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
