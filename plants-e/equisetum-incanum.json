    "intro": "Equisetum incanum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. Equisetum incanum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
