    "intro": "Euphorbia serpillifolia var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western sandmat, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
