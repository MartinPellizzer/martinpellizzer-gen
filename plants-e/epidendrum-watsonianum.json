    "intro": "Epidendrum watsonianum, commonly known as the Watson's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Epidendrum watsonianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
