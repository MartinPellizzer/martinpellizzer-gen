    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cubense, commonly known as the Cuban holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Elaphoglossum cubense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
