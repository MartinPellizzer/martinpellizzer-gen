    "intro": "Euphorbia crotonoides, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features succulent, branching stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. Euphorbia crotonoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
