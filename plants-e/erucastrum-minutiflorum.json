    "intro": "Erucastrum minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered erucaceous, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive and adapted for absorbing moisture from deep within the soil. Erucastrum minutiflorum is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the landscape and supporting local biodiversity."
