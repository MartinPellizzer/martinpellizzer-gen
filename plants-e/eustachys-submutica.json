    "intro": "Eustachys submutica, commonly known as the rough flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers that bloom in late summer. Eustachys submutica plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
