    "intro": "Epicranthes phymatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the warm seasons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
