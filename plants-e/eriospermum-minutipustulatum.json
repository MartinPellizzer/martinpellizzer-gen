    "intro": "Eriospermum minutipustulatum, commonly known as the small-pustule eriosperm, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, hairy capsule that disperses seeds by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
