    "intro": "Equisetum limosum var. verticillatum, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, ridged stems and spore-producing cones. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as marshes and stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. The plant's leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its stems are rich in silica, giving them a rigid, almost glassy texture. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its growth is often limited by environmental conditions like water availability. This variety is distinguished by its whorled arrangement of branches, which sets it apart from other equisetum species."
