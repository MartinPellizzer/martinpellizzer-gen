    "intro": "Euphorbia herbacea, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
