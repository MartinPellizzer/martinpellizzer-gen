    "intro": "Equisetum palustre f. simplex, commonly known as the simple marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. The plant is typically found in wetlands and moist soils, where it thrives in shaded to semi-shaded conditions. Its stems are covered with a silica-rich cuticle, giving them a rough texture and making them resistant to herbivory. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
