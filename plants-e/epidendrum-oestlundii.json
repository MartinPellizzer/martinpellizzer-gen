    "intro": "Epidendrum oestlundii, commonly known as the Oestlund's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces striking clusters of white or pink flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Epidendrum oestlundii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
