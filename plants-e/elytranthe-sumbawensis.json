    "intro": "Elytranthe sumbawensis, commonly known as the Sumbawa elytranthe, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cavity, a feature common among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat destruction, Elytranthe sumbawensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
