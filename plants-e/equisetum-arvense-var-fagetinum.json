    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. fagetinum, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a perennial plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae, known for its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, nutrient-rich environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves and roots. This variety is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in humid conditions."
