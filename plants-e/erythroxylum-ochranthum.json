    "intro": "Erythroxylum ochranthum, commonly known as the red-berried erythroxylum, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are not typically consumed by humans but are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking autumn foliage."
