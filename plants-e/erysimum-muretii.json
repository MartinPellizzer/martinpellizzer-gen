    "intro": "Erysimum muretii, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Erysimum muretii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
