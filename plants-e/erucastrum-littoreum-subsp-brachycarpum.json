    "intro": "Erucastrum littoreum subsp. brachycarpum, commonly known as sea rocket, is a coastal plant native to the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant features small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, arranged in clusters and appearing in early spring. The subspecies brachycarpum is distinguished by its short, club-shaped fruits, which contain the seeds."
