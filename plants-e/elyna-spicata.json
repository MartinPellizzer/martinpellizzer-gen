    "intro": "Elyna spicata, commonly known as the spikeflower lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically bright yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Elyna spicata plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
