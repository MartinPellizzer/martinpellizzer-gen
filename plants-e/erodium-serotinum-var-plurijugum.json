    "intro": "Erodium serotinum var. plurijugum, commonly known as the late erodium or the common stormweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is an annual herb characterized by its small, pink or purple flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas readily. Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability."
