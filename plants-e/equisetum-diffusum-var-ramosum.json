    "intro": "Equisetum diffusum var. ramosum, commonly known as the bracted horse tail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of sterile and fertile branches, with the fertile branches bearing spore-bearing structures called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It possesses a unique structure with a central stem and multiple branches, and it lacks true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures. This ancient plant is considered a living fossil, with a morphology that has remained largely unchanged for millions of years."
