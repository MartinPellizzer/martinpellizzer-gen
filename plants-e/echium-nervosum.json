It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are tubular and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Echium nervosum is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in poor soils due to its adaptability."
