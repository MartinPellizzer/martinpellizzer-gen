    "intro": "Erica axilliflora, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in terminal clusters. Erica axilliflora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is a hardy plant often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value."
