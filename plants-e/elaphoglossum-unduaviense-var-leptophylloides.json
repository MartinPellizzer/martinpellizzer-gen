    "intro": "Elaphoglossum unduaviense var. leptophylloides, commonly known as the slender-leafed holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The varietal form, leptophylloides, is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to the typical variety."
