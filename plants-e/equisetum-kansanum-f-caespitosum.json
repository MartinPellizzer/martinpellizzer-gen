    "intro": "Equisetum kansanum f. caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted scouring rush, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, ridged stem. This fern ally is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its primitive structure reflects its ancient lineage. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
