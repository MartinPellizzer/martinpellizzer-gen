It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves and a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. Its flowers have a distinctive, intricate structure with a spurred lip that serves as a nectar source for pollinators. The orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations."
