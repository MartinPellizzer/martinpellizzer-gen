    "intro": "Elleanthus carinatus, commonly known as the African feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a slight curvature along the midrib, contributing to its unique morphology. Elleanthus carinatus is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
