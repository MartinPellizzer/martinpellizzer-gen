    "intro": "Elaeocarpus congestifolius, commonly known as the clustered-leaved elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, clustered foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in whorls. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
