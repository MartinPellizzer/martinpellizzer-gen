    "intro": "Exostema purpureum subsp. avenium, commonly known as the purple flame orchid, is a striking orchid species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and pink flowers, which bloom in dense clusters during the warmer months. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
