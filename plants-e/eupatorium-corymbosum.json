It features tall, branching stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that have a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale purple flowers in the late summer and early fall. Boneset is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its fever-reducing effects."
