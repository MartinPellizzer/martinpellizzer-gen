    "intro": "Eryngium creticum, commonly known as the Cretan thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and purple-blue flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eryngium creticum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
