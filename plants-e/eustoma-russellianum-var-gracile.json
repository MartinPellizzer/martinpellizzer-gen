It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters atop slender stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
