    "intro": "Eucalyptus clavigera var. gilbertensis, commonly known as Gilbert's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to white bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or cream in color, blooming in winter or early spring. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
