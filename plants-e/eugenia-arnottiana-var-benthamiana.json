It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when mature, though they are not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
