    "intro": "Epidendrum \u00d7 wilsonianum, commonly known as the Wilson's Epidendrum, is a hybrid orchid native to Central America. It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, characterized by its fleshy, swollen stems that store water. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum \u00d7 wilsonianum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
