    "intro": "Euphrasia squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy eyebright, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy glands, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are oval and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Euphrasia squarrosa is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
