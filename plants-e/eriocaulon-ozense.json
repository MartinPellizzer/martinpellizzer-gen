    "intro": "Eriocaulon ozense, commonly known as the Ozonese flat sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, where it thrives in high humidity. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are often inconspicuous and adapted for wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Eriocaulon ozense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
