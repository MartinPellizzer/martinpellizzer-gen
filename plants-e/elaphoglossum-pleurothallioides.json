    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pleurothallioides, commonly known as the pleurothallioid fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
