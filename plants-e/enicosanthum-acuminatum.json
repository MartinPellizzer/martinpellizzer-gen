    "intro": "Enicosanthum acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-pointed poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues during the holiday season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. The true flowers of Enicosanthum acuminatum are small and inconspicuous, hidden among the showy bracts."
