    "intro": "Eleogenus laetevirens, commonly known as the cheerful green orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its vibrant green foliage and delicate, elongated flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-draining soil. Its unique growth habit includes a short, thick rhizome and clustered pseudobulbs that support its foliage and floral structures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Eleogenus laetevirens is considered a conservation concern."
