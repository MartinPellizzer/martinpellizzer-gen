    "intro": "Euscaphis saponica, commonly known as the Chinese pear or Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits and is also used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance."
