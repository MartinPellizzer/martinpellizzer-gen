    "intro": "Eugenioides hispidulum, commonly known as the rough eugenia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
