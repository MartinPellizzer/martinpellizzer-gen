    "intro": "Eugenia ludoviciana, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
