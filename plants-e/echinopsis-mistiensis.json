    "intro": "Echinopsis mistiensis, commonly known as the Misti Star Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its short, columnar stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Echinopsis mistiensis is adapted to arid and high-altitude environments, requiring well-draining soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and botanical gardens."
