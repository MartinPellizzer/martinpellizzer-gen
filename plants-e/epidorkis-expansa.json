    "intro": "Epidorkis expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. Epidorkis expansa is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological significance in its native habitats."
