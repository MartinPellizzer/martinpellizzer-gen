    "intro": "Epidendrum paniculatum var. longicrure, commonly known as the long-armed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
