    "intro": "Euonymus decorus, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Euonymus decorus is often used as a hedge or foundation plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability."
