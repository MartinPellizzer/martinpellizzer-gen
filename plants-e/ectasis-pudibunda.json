    "intro": "Ectasis pudibunda, commonly known as the shy bellflower, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ectasis pudibunda is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
