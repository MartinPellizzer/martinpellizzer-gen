    "intro": "Euphorbia colligata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, a common trait among many euphorbias. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
