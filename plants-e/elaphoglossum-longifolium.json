It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Elaphoglossum longifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
