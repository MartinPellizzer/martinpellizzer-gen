    "intro": "Eriophyllum gracile, commonly known as slenderleaf goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it has narrow, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. Eriophyllum gracile is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
