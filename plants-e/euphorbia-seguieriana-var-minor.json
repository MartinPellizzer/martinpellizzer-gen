    "intro": "Euphorbia seguieriana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to arid regions of Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically green or yellowish in color, often adorned with small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a striking addition to dryland landscapes."
