    "intro": "Eriocereus polyacanthus, commonly known as the long-spined night bloomer, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces striking white flowers at night, which emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours before closing. Eriocereus polyacanthus thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
