    "intro": "Equilabium scopulicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Caloplacaceae and is characterized by its tightly adherent growth on substrates such as soil, rock, or wood. The plant exhibits a thallus structure that is typically crustose, forming a dense, flat layer that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It is often found in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low nutrient availability. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
