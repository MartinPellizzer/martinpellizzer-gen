    "intro": "Euphorbia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem covered in thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
