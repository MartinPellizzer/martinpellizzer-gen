    "intro": "Euphorbia stellulata, commonly known as the star-spurred euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a thick, succulent appearance, adapted to arid environments, and features milky sap that can be toxic. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia stellulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and resilience in dry conditions."
