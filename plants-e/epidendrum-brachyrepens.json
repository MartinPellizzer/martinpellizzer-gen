It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems arising from a rhizome. Its leaves are usually oval to lance-shaped, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, or pink. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, moist conditions."
