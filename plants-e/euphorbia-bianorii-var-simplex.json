    "intro": "Euphorbia bianorii var. simplex, commonly known as the simple euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences, often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are typically small and rounded, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
