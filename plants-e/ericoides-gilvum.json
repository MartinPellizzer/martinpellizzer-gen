It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically bright green or yellowish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late summer. Ericoides gilvum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland or coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover in suitable habitats."
