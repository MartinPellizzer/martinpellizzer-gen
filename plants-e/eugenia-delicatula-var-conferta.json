    "intro": "Eugenia delicatula var. conferta, commonly known as the clustered holly or conferta holly, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage and ornamental berries make it a valuable addition to shaded landscapes."
