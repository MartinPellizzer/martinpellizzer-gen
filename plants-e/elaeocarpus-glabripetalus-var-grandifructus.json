    "intro": "Elaeocarpus glabripetalus var. grandifructus, commonly known as the large-fruited elaeocarpus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers followed by large, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. The fruit's thick, fleshy pulp is edible and often consumed by various bird species, aiding in seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
