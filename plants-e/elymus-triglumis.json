    "intro": "Elymus triglumis, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of three\u8292-like awns. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. Elymus triglumis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects and small animals."
