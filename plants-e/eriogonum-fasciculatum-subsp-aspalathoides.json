It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to arid and rocky environments. It is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
