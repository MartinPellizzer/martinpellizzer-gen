    "intro": "Elaphoglossum grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum grandifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
