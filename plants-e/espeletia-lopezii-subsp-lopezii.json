    "intro": "Espeletia lopezii subsp. lopezii, commonly known as the Lopez's espeletia, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces inflorescences of white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to insulate the plant and reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
