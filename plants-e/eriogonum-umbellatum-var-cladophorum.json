    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. cladophorum, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give the leaves a sticky texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky areas. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
