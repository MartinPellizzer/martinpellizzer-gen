It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-pink berries that appear in late summer. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
