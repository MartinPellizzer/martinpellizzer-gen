    "intro": "Eucalyptus striaticalyx subsp. delicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are small and white or pale pink, clustered in umbels, and appear in late summer to autumn. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
