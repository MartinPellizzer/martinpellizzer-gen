    "intro": "Equisetum limosum var. aphyllum, commonly known as the barren willow scaly fern, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant that thrives in wet, marshy environments. The plant is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead having whorls of small, scale-like structures. Its stems are jointed and covered in a rough, silica-rich surface. This variant is notable for its reduced foliage, which distinguishes it from other equisetum species."
