    "intro": "Erythranthe depressa var. ciminum, commonly known as the Sierra lemon verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, lemon-scented yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to sunny, arid environments. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth make it a desirable ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens."
