    "intro": "Eranthis stellata, commonly known as the spring snowflake, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its early blooming habit, often appearing in late winter or early spring before many other plants. The plant features bright yellow flowers with a star-shaped appearance, composed of five petal-like sepals. Its leaves are palmately divided and appear after the flowers, contributing to its ornamental value. Eranthis stellata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
