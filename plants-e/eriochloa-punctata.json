    "intro": "Eriochloa punctata, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy appearance on both sides, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a single, compact spikelet that is often tinged with red or purple. Eriochloa punctata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
