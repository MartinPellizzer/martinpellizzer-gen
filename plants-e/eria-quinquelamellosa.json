    "intro": "Eria quinquelamellosa, commonly known as the five-winged fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is notable for its unique morphology, with fronds that have five distinct lamellae, contributing to its common name."
