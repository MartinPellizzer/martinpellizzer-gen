    "intro": "Echinops bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical crown and is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops bequaertii is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
