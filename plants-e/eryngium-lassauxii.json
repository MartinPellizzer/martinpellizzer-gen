It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowering heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. It produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eryngium lassauxii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
