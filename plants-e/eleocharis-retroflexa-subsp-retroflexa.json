    "intro": "Eleocharis retroflexa subsp. retroflexa, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and small, clustered spikelets that typically bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense vegetation in moist soils. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
