    "intro": "Epidendrum cinnabarinum, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red-tipped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its vibrant appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
