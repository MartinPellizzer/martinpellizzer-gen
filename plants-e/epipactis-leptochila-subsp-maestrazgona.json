    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila subsp. maestrazgona, commonly known as the Maestrazza helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain meadows and forest edges. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
