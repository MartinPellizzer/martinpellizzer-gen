    "intro": "Eriospermum ernstii, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriospermum ernstii is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems."
