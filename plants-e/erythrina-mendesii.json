    "intro": "Erythrina mendesii, commonly known as the red flame tree, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its slender, often multi-branched stems can grow up to several meters in height. The seeds are enclosed in elongated, woody pods that split open when mature. Erythrina mendesii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
