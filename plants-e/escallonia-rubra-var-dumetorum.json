It features dense, glossy dark green foliage that provides a striking contrast to its showy, tubular pink to red flowers. The plant produces small, oval berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
