    "intro": "Euphorbia xylopoda, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that are covered in a layer of white, powdery sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and often shed during dry periods, allowing the plant to conserve water. Euphorbia xylopoda is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
