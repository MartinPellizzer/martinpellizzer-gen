    "intro": "Ecbolium chrysotrichomum, commonly known as the golden-haired ecbolium, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in dense, golden-yellow hairs, which provide a distinctive visual appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically arranged oppositely along the stem. Ecbolium chrysotrichomum is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
