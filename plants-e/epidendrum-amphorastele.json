    "intro": "Epidendrum amphorastele, commonly known as the bottle-shaped epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the warm season. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Epidendrum amphorastele is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
