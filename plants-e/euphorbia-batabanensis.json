    "intro": "Euphorbia batabanensis, commonly known as the Bataban euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by colorful bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
