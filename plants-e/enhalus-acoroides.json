It belongs to the Acoraceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates and plays a vital role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for marine life. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by water currents. Enhalus acoroides is an important component of seagrass meadows, contributing to coastal ecosystem health and biodiversity."
