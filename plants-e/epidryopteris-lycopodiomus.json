    "intro": "Epidryopteris lycopodiomus, commonly known as the lycopod fern, is a unique plant that exhibits characteristics of both ferns and lycophytes. It belongs to the family Lycopodaceae and is notable for its small, scale-like leaves that resemble those of true ferns. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, a feature common in many primitive plant species. Epidryopteris lycopodiomus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
