It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically has palmate leaves composed of three to five leaflets, and its seeds are enclosed in pods. Erythrina species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, the Americas, and Southeast Asia. These plants are not only ornamental but also have traditional uses in medicine and as a source of dye."
