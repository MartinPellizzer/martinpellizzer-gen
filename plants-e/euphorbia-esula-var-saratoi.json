    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. saratoi, commonly known as the Siberian spurge, is a perennial plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Europe. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
