    "intro": "Eugenia pubicalyx, commonly known as the white myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by small, round berries. Eugenia pubicalyx thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value and aromatic properties make it a popular choice for horticultural use."
