    "intro": "Elaphoglossum insulare, commonly known as the island holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Elaphoglossum insulare is often found in humid, low-light conditions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
