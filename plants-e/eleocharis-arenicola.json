    "intro": "Eleocharis arenicola, commonly known as the sand spike rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and coastal regions. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dunes or disturbed areas. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often densely packed, forming a clump-like structure. Its tiny, spike-like inflorescences bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis arenicola is well adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand salt exposure."
