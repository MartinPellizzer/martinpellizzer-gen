    "intro": "Eriocereus arendtii, commonly known as the Arendt's night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are cylindrical and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
