    "intro": "Evax prolifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh fern, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a smooth, dark green appearance, and its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
