    "intro": "Espeletia argentea subsp. phaneractis, commonly known as the silver star or cloud plant, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a silvery appearance, and its rosette structure that holds rainwater. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitat."
