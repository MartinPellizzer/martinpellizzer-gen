    "intro": "Euphorbia media, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
