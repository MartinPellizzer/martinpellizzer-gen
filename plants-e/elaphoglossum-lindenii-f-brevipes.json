    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lindenii f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically short and broad, with a dense arrangement that helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. This fern is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, showcasing its adaptation to rocky substrates."
