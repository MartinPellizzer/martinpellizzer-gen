    "intro": "Euphorbia nutans subsp. glaberrima, commonly known as the hanging spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its pendulous stems that bear clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the plant's modified flower clusters. The leaves are typically small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
