    "intro": "Euphorbia segetalis var. truncata, commonly known as the cutleaf spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, and often spiny leaves that are truncate or notched at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
