    "intro": "Euphorbia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascan spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its leaves and stems. Euphorbia madagascariensis is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
