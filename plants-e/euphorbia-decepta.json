    "intro": "Euphorbia decepta, commonly known as the deceptive spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a unique defense mechanism, producing a toxic latex when damaged, which can cause skin irritation. Its leaves are typically small and alternate along the stems, contributing to its compact appearance. Euphorbia decepta thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
