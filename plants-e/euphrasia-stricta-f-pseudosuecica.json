    "intro": "Euphrasia stricta f. pseudosuecica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This perennial herb is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
