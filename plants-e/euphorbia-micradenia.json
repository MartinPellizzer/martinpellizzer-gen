    "intro": "Euphorbia micradenia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with sparse, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
