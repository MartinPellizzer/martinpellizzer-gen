    "intro": "Eubotrys odorata, commonly known as the fragrant honeysuckle, is a climbing plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Eubotrys odorata is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it can climb trees or shrubs."
