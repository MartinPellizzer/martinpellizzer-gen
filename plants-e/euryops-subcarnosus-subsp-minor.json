    "intro": "Euryops subcarnosus subsp. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved guinea grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats."
