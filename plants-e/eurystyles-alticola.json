    "intro": "Eurystyles alticola, commonly known as the alpine beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Eurystyles alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
