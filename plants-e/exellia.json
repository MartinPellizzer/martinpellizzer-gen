It consists of several species, primarily found in South America, with some species extending into Africa and Australia. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow ray flowers that resemble dandelions. They are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Exellia species are typically herbaceous, with some exhibiting succulent features to adapt to dry conditions."
