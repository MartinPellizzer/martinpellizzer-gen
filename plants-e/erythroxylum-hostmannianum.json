    "intro": "Erythroxylum hostmannianum, commonly known as the hostmann's coca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its small, green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody capsules containing seeds. It is often found in high-altitude areas with cool, moist climates. Due to its botanical similarity to other coca species, it has been the subject of scientific study regarding its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
