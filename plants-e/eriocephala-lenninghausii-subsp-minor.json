    "intro": "Eriocephala lenninghausii subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser eriocephala, is a small shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It is adapted to rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species in harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally important plant in its native habitat."
