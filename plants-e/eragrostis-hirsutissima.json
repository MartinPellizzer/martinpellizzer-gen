    "intro": "Eragrostis hirsutissima, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. Hairy bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
