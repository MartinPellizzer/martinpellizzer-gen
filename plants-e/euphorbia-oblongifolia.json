    "intro": "Euphorbia oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features erect, branching stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
