    "intro": "Eryngium planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaved thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Eryngium planifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens due to its distinctive appearance."
