    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pattersoniae, commonly known as the Patterson's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing sori that are arranged in a distinctive, linear pattern along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized fern species."
