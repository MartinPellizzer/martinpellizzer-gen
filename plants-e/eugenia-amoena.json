It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces striking clusters of violet to purple berries that ripen in the fall. These berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for various birds and wildlife. Eugenia amoena is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
