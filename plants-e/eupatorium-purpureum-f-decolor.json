It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple of the species. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along streams, thriving in moist, sunny environments. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
