    "intro": "Erythrina cordifolia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking crimson flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often appearing before the leaves in spring. The tree has trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, giving it its scientific name *cordifolia*, meaning \"heart-leaved.\" Its pods are long, slender, and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
