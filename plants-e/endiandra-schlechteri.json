It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland dipterocarp forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow. The species is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a significant component of the region's biodiversity."
