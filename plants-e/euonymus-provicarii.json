    "intro": "Euonymus provicarii, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are ornamental. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ground cover in shaded garden areas. Due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
