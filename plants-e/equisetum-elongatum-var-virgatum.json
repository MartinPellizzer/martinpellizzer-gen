    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. virgatum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
