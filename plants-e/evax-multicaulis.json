    "intro": "Evax multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered evax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various habitats. Evax multicaulis is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
