    "intro": "Enckea plantaginea, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems and heart-shaped, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rhizomes are edible and have a starchy texture similar to taro, making it a traditional food source. Enckea plantaginea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
