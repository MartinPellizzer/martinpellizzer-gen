    "intro": "Espostoa laticornua var. rubens, commonly known as the red-horned espostoa, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange bracts that surround the flower, giving it a dramatic and eye-catching appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the base of the inflorescence, adding contrast to its colorful foliage. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. This variety is highly sought after by collectors due to its unique coloration and rarity in the wild."
