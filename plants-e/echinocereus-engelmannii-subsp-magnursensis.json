    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. magnursensis, commonly known as the Magnussen's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions."
