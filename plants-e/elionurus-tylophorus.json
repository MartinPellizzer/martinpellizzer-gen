    "intro": "Elionurus tylophorus, commonly known as the woolly bladdernut, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds, a feature typical of the Elionurus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks. The woolly bladdernut is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
