    "intro": "Euphorbia depauperata var. pubiflora, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive and hardy addition to arid landscapes."
