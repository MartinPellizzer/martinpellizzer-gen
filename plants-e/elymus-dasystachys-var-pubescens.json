    "intro": "Elymus dasystachys var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant or for erosion control."
