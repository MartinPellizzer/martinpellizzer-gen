It typically features dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects."
