    "intro": "Epipetrum, commonly known as the silver sword or rainbow plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The leaves are typically thick and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Epipetrum species produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, purple, or blue, which bloom in the spring. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with moderate sunlight."
