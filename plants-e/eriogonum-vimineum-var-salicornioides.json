    "intro": "Eriogonum vimineum var. salicornioides, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal buckwheat, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to harsh coastal conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
