    "intro": "Eremostachys stocksii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features compact, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Eremostachys stocksii is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas."
