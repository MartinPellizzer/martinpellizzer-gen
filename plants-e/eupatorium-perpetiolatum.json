    "intro": "Eupatorium perpetiolatum, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It features showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming from late summer to early fall. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually hairy and somewhat woody at the base. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in saturated soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
