    "intro": "Eugenia mouensis, commonly known as the Mou Island guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Mo'orea in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fragrant fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
