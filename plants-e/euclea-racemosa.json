    "intro": "Euclea racemosa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Euclea racemosa is valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional uses in medicine and construction."
