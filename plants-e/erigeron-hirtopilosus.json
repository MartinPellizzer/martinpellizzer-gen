    "intro": "Erigeron hirtopilosus, commonly known as the hairyleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small white to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Erigeron hirtopilosus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid climates."
