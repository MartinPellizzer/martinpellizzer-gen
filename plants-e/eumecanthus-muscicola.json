    "intro": "Eumecanthus muscicola, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, smooth capsule, which aids in their dispersal by wind or animals. Eumecanthus muscicola is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
