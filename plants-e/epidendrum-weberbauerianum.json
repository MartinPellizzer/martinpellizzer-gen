    "intro": "Epidendrum weberbauerianum, commonly known as the Weberbauer's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, arching stems with numerous lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
