    "intro": "Eriogonum shoshonense, commonly known as the Shoshone buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its showy, clustered inflorescences of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum shoshonense plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
