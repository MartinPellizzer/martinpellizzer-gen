It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, stiff leaves and dense clusters of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bristly, awned seeds. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects and as a forage crop."
