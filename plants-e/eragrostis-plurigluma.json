    "intro": "Eragrostis plurigluma, commonly known as slender false brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and slender, branching inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, spike-like clusters of pale green to golden flowers. Eragrostis plurigluma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
