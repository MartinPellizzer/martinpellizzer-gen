    "intro": "Echinocactus sellowii var. courantii, commonly known as the Serra do Cip\u00f3 cactus, is a slow-growing, spineless cactus native to Brazil. It features a cylindrical, ribbed stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a gray-green to blue-gray coloration. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the top of the stems. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
