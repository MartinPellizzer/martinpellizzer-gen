    "intro": "Epidendrum peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange, often with a yellow or green throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. Epidendrum peruvianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid conditions."
