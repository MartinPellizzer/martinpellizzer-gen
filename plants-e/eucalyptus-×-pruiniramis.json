    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 pruiniramis, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a hybrid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, globular blue or white flowers that appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various climates."
