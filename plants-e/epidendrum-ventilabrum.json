    "intro": "Epidendrum ventilabrum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Wind, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that resemble a bell or tube, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum ventilabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation."
