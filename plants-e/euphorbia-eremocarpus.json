    "intro": "Euphorbia eremocarpus, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Euphorbia eremocarpus is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
