It is characterized by its distinctive rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically large, leathery, and have a glossy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
