    "intro": "Euphorbia goudotii, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a waxy, spiny surface that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution."
