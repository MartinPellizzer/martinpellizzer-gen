    "intro": "Echeveria campanulata, commonly known as the \"Blue Echeveria,\" is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its vibrant color. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
