    "intro": "Erythrina neglecta, commonly known as the flame tree or red tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often in the summer months. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its aggressive spread."
