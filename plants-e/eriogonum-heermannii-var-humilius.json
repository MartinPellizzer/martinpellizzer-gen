It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils within desert and chaparral habitats."
