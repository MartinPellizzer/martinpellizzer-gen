    "intro": "Encelia californica var. asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf desert hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough, sandpaper-like texture, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive red or orange center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an important species in its native habitat."
