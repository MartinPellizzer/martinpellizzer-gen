    "intro": "Erigeron salsuginosus, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually silver or gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the summer, adding a delicate white or pale blue color to the landscape."
