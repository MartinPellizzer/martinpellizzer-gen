    "intro": "Euphorbia collina var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features erect, branched stems covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
