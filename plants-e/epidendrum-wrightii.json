    "intro": "Epidendrum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences and showy, brightly colored flowers that typically range from yellow to orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support for the flowering spikes. Epidendrum wrightii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
