    "intro": "Elaeocarpus coriaceus, commonly known as the rough-leaved elaeocarpus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is rugged and dark in color, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in tropical forest ecosystems."
