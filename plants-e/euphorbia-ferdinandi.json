    "intro": "Euphorbia ferdinandi, commonly known as the Ferdinand's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with spiny leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap, so care should be taken when handling it."
