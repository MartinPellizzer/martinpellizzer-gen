    "intro": "Epidendrum sanchoi, commonly known as the Sancho's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant features broad, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Epidendrum sanchoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
