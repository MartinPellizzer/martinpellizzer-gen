    "intro": "Erigeron acris var. khasianus, commonly known as the Khasi fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, with showy white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical E. acris."
