    "intro": "Epidendrum leucolistron, commonly known as the white-veined epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with contrasting veining. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. Epidendrum leucolistron is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
