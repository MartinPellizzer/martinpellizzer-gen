    "intro": "Erythroxylum rhodappendiculatum, commonly known as the red-veined coca, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its striking red veins on its dark green leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsules containing numerous seeds. This species is of interest both for its ornamental value and its historical use in traditional medicine."
