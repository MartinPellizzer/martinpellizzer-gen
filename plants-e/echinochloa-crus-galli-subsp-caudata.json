    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli subsp. caudata, commonly known as cocklebur grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and distinctive, spiky seed heads that resemble a bristled tail. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
