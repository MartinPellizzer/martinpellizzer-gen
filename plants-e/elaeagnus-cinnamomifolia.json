    "intro": "Elaeagnus cinnamomifolia, commonly known as the cinnamon leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves that emit a faintly aromatic scent, especially when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Elaeagnus cinnamomifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
