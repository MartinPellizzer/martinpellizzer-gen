    "intro": "Euphorbia tetraptera var. robusta, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often green or reddish in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
