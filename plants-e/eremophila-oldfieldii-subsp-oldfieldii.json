    "intro": "Eremophila oldfieldii subsp. oldfieldii, commonly known as Oldfield's eremophila, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in spring. It is well-suited to dry, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This subspecies is valued in native gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
