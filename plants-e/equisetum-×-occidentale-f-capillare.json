    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 occidentale f. capillare, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a hybrid fern ally characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant retains a primitive morphology, with a central stem that is segmented and covered in rough, silica-rich nodes. Its reproductive structures include strobili, which produce spores, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. This fern ally is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
