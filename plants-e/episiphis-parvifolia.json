    "intro": "Episiphis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved epiphytic orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a delicate appearance that blends into its natural habitat. Episiphis parvifolia is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
