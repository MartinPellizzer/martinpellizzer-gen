    "intro": "Elaeagnus pungens f. frederici, commonly known as the silver-leafed eleagnus, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by small, edible fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
