    "intro": "Excoecaria biglandulosa f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved croton, is a variant of the croton genus characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant features a woody stem with thick, ridged bark and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The longifolia form is distinguished by its notably longer leaves compared to the typical variety."
