    "intro": "Eugenia cycloidea, commonly known as the cycloid eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
