    "intro": "Echium rosulatum subsp. davaei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptation to arid environments."
