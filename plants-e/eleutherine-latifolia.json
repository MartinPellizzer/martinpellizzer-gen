    "intro": "Eleutherine latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf eleutherine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features rhizomatous growth and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and glossy. The plant blooms with small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in shady, moist environments. Eleutherine latifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
