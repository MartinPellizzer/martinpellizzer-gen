    "intro": "Erysimum pseudorhaeticum, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Erysimum pseudorhaeticum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging conditions."
