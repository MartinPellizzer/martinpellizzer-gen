    "intro": "Euphorbia juglans, commonly known as the walnut tree spurge, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, containing compounds that may cause skin irritation. Euphorbia juglans typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and riparian areas."
