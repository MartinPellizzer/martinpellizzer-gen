    "intro": "Eucalyptus delegatensis subsp. delegatensis, commonly known as the Mount Buffalo gum, is a tall, slender tree native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules that contain aromatic, elliptical seeds. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in open, rocky areas. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
