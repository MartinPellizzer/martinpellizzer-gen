    "intro": "Euphorbia golisana, commonly known as the Golisana spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species of spurges characterized by their milky sap. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its striking yellow-orange inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia golisana is often used in traditional medicine, though its toxic sap requires caution during handling."
