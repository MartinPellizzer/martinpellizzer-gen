    "intro": "Erica cinerea var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
