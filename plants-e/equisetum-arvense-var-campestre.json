    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. campestre, commonly known as field horsetail, is a variant of the horsetail plant characterized by its tall, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, whorled nodes, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense. This variety is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it an important species in ecological succession."
