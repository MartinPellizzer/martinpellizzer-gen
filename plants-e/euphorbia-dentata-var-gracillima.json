    "intro": "Euphorbia dentata var. gracillima, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, narrow, ribbed stems that are often tinged with red or purple. The leaves are small, ovate, and toothed, giving the plant its scientific name. It produces small, yellowish-green cyathia (cup-like flower clusters) that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
