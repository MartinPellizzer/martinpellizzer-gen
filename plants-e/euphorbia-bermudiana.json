    "intro": "Euphorbia bermudiana, commonly known as the Bermuda buttercup, is a succulent plant native to Bermuda. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 with a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant."
