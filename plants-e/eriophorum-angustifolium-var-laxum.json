    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium var. laxum, commonly known as narrowleaf cotton grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often in bogs, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
