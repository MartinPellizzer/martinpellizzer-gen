It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, glandular-dotted leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually yellow to pink, and it produces small, bract-like structures called pappus that aid in seed dispersal. This species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
