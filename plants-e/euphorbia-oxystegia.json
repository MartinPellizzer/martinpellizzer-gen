    "intro": "Euphorbia oxystegia, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia oxystegia is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
