    "intro": "Encephalartos caffer, commonly known as the Natal knobbed cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
