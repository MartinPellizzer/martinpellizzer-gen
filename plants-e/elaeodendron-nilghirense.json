    "intro": "Elaeodendron nilghirense, commonly known as the Nilgiri elaeodendron, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
