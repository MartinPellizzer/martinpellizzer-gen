    "intro": "Euphorbia preslii var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and resilience in arid or rocky environments."
