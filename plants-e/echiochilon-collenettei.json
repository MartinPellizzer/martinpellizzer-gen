    "intro": "Echiochilon collenettei, commonly known as the Collenette's echiochilon, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, composite flower heads. Echiochilon collenettei thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
