    "intro": "Eriogonum jamesii var. wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is part of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like sorrel and buckwheat."
