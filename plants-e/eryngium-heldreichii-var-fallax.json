It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads and gray-green, pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
