    "intro": "Eupatorium elatum, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium elatum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diaphoretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
