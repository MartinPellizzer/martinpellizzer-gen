It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Elaphoglossum palmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
