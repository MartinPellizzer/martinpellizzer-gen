The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its attractive foliage and adaptability, it is often used in gardens and as a hedge plant."
