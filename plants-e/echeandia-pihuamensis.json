    "intro": "Echeandia pihuamensis, commonly known as the Pihuam\u00e9n Escalona, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species."
