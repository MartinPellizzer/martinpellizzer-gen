    "intro": "Eugenia valvata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often found in coastal areas and moist forests, and it plays a role in local ecosystems despite its invasive tendencies in some regions."
