    "intro": "Eremostachys adpressa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has succulent-like leaves that are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to desert landscapes. Eremostachys adpressa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is a valuable component of native plant communities in its habitat."
