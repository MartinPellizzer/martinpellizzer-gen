    "intro": "Elaphoglossum xanthopodum, commonly known as the yellow-footed holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds with a distinctive yellowish base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum xanthopodum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
