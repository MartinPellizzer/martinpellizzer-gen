    "intro": "Euphorbia obliqua var. phyllanthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in soft, greenish-gray foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
