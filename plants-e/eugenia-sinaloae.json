    "intro": "Eugenia sinaloae, commonly known as the Sinaloa guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct flavor. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Eugenia sinaloae is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland areas."
