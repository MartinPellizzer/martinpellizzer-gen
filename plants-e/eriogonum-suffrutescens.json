    "intro": "Eriogonum suffrutescens, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, low-growing stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, papery leaves and showy blooms make it a distinctive feature of its native landscape. Eriogonum suffrutescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
