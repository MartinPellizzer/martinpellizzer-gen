    "intro": "Euphorbia melillensis, commonly known as the Melilla spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in the summer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
