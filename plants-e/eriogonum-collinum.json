    "intro": "Eriogonum collinum, commonly known as the mountain mullein, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and meadows. The plant features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum collinum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment."
