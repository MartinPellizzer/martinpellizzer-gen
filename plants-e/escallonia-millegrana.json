    "intro": "Escallonia millegrana, commonly known as the fragrant escallonia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, floral display, and ability to attract wildlife."
