    "intro": "Erica barbigeroides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in dune environments. Erica barbigeroides is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing dune formations."
