It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
