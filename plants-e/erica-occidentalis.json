It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Erica occidentalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
