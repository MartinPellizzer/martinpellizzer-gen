    "intro": "Euphorbia tinctoria, commonly known as the red spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. However, it contains toxic milky sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it."
