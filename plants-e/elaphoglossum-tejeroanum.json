    "intro": "Elaphoglossum tejeroanum, commonly known as the T\u00e9jero's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping in growth habit. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
