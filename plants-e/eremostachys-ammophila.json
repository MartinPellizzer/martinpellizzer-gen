    "intro": "Eremostachys ammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Eremostachys ammophila plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife in its native range."
