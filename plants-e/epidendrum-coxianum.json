    "intro": "Epidendrum coxianum, commonly known as the Crimson Lip Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red petals and a contrasting yellow lip, which make it highly ornamental. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Epidendrum coxianum requires well-draining potting media and consistent moisture to thrive."
