    "intro": "Epidendrum melanoxeros, commonly known as the black-leaved epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance and blooming habits make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
