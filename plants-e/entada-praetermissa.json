    "intro": "Entada praetermissa, commonly known as the African saffron tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and long, pinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange pods that contain seeds covered in a bright red aril, which resembles saffron, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodlands. The tree is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
