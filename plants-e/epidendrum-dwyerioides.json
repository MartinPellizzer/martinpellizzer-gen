    "intro": "Epidendrum dwyerioides, commonly known as the Dwyer's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulb system that supports its growth in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces racemose inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum dwyerioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
