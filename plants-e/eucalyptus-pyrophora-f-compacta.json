    "intro": "Eucalyptus pyrophora f. compacta, commonly known as the compact eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and small, rough, greyish bark. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a whitish underside. It produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers, typically in spring. This variety is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used in coastal or urban landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
