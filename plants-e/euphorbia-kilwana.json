    "intro": "Euphorbia kilwana, commonly known as the Kilwa spurge, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a spiny appearance due to its thorny stems. Euphorbia kilwana is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a hardy species in tropical and subtropical climates."
