    "intro": "Eria brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine roots. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural collections, though it requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive."
