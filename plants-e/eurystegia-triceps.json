It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
