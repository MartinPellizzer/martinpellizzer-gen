    "intro": "Eriocaulon neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonia hairgrass, is a small aquatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as marshes and pond margins, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, emerging on slender stalks above the water surface. Eriocaulon neocaledonicum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
