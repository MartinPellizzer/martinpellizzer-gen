It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Eriocoma heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
