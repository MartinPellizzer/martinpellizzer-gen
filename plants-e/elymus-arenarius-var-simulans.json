It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it an important component of native plant communities."
