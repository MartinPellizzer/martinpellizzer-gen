    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 kitcheneri, commonly known as the hybrid willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It is a hybrid between Epilobium angustifolium (narrow-leaf willow herb) and Epilobium palustre (marsh willow herb). The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. It has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in racemes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
