    "intro": "Eragrostis tenella var. viscosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, flat leaves with a distinctive silky texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
