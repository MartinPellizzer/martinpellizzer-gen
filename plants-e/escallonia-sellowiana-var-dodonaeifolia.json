    "intro": "Escallonia sellowiana var. dodonaeifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf escallonia, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which provides a striking contrast to its vibrant red or orange flowers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environments. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and resilience to various growing conditions."
