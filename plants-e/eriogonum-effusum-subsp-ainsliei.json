    "intro": "Eriogonum effusum subsp. ainsliei, commonly known as the Ainslie's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
