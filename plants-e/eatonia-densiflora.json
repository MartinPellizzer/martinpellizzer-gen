It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
