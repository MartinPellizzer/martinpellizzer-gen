    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia subsp. purpurea, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves and its striking, showy purple or pink flower spike. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces numerous small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive purple lip. It blooms from late spring to early summer, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction. This subspecies is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
