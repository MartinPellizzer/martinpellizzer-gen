    "intro": "Elaphoglossum picardae, commonly known as the Picard's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Elaphoglossum picardae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
