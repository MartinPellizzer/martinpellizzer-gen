    "intro": "Eriospermum lanceifolium, commonly known as the lanceleaf eriosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Eriospermum lanceifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and extended blooming period."
