    "intro": "Euphorbia orobanchoides, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia orobanchoides is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
