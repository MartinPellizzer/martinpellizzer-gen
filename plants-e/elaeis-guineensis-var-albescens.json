    "intro": "Elaeis guineensis var. albescens, commonly known as the white oil palm, is a variant of the oil palm characterized by its pale or white-colored fruits. This variety is native to tropical regions of Africa and is cultivated for its oil-rich seeds. The plant exhibits typical palm morphology, with a straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves. Its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences, and it produces fruits that are smaller than those of the standard oil palm. Due to its unique coloration, it is often used in ornamental horticulture and for specialty oil production."
