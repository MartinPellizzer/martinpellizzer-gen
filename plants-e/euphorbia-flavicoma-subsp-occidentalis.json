    "intro": "Euphorbia flavicoma subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western yellow euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
