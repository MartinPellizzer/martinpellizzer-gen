    "intro": "Elleanthus ortizianus, commonly known as the Ortizian sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Elleanthus ortizianus is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
