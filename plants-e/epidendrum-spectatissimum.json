    "intro": "Epidendrum spectatissimum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum spectatissimum is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
