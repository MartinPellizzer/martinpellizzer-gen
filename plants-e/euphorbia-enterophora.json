    "intro": "Euphorbia enterophora, commonly known as the coral euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, branching structure with fleshy, green stems that resemble coral. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
