    "intro": "Eriogonum capistratum var. muhlickii, commonly known as Muhlick's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
