    "intro": "Euphorbia atrispina var. viridis, commonly known as the green-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or reddish in color, often with prominent, spiny protrusions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
