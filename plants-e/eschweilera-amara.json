    "intro": "Eschweilera amara, commonly known as the bitter chuchuhuasi, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly the use of its bark in traditional medicine. Eschweilera amara thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforest canopies. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
