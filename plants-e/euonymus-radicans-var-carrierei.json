    "intro": "Euonymus radicans var. carrierei, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used as a ground cover due to its dense, spreading growth habit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
