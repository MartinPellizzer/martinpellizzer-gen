    "intro": "Euphrasia hirtella var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth euphrasia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has slender, hairy stems that produce small, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, which distinguish it from other similar species. The subspecies subglabra is notable for its smoother leaf surface compared to the typical form of Euphrasia hirtella."
