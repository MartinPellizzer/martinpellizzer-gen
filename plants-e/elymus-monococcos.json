    "intro": "Elymus monococcos, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescence that consists of multiple spikelets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus monococcos is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
