    "intro": "Euphorbia boivinii var. oreades, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in dry climates."
