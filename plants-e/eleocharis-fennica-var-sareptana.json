    "intro": "Eleocharis fennica var. sareptana, commonly known as the Sareptan spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched and bear small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps at the base. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
