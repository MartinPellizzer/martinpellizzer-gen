    "intro": "Erythranthe tenella, commonly known as the cushion sandplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, pinkish-purple flowers in the spring. Its compact growth habit helps it resist wind and conserve moisture. Erythranthe tenella is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system."
