    "intro": "Euphorbia brownii, commonly known as the Brown's spurge, is a succulent plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia brownii is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if touched or ingested."
