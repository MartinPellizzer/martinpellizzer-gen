    "intro": "Ervatamia polyneura, commonly known as the narrow-leafed eragrostis, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and savanna ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
