    "intro": "Eremurus korolkowii, commonly known as the \"desert candle,\" is a striking plant native to Central Asia. It is a member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family and is characterized by its tall, candle-like flower stalks that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its cold hardiness, it is also cultivated in temperate climates as an ornamental plant."
