It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
