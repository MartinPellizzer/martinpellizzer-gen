    "intro": "Eriocaulon milhoense, commonly known as the Brazilian spikerush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within its habitat. Eriocaulon milhoense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
