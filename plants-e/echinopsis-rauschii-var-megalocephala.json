    "intro": "Echinopsis rauschii var. megalocephala, commonly known as the giant-headed moon cactus, is a striking cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, spherical stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, adorned with prominent, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces showy, night-blooming flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its unique appearance and seasonal blooming, it is a popular choice for both collectors and horticultural enthusiasts."
