    "intro": "Euphorbia bridgesii, commonly known as the Orange Tree or Bridgewater's Spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its striking orange bark and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
