    "intro": "Eriogonum prattenianum var. avium, commonly known as the Avian's eriogonum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. This species is often found in chaparral and sagebrush habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of arid and semi-arid regions."
