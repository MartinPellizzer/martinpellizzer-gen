    "intro": "Echinopsis eyriesii var. cristata, commonly known as the Cristata Cactus, is a unique variant of the Echinopsis genus native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, flattened, crest-like growth form, which sets it apart from typical cactus species. The plant features dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscaped gardens."
