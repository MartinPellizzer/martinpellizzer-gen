    "intro": "Elaeagnus hortensis var. orientalis, commonly known as the silver berry or oriental silver leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance, and its small, edible berries that are often consumed by wildlife. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It produces fragrant yellow flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its characteristic berries later in the season. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
