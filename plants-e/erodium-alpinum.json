    "intro": "Erodium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine bedstraw, is a small flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Erodium alpinum is often found in open meadows and scree slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
