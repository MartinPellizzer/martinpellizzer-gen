    "intro": "Euonymus carinatus, commonly known as the crested euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often ridged bark, which gives it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, with a glossy surface. Euonymus carinatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
