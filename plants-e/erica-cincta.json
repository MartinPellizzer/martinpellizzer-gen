    "intro": "Erica cincta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are evergreen and covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica cincta is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
