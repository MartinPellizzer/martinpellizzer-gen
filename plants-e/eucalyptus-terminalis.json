    "intro": "Eucalyptus terminalis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus terminalis is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, are widely used in medicinal and aromatic applications."
