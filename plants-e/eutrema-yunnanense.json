    "intro": "Eutrema yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Eutrema yunnanense is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with limited moisture."
