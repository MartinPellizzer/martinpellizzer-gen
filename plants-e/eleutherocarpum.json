    "intro": "Eleutherocarpum, commonly known as the Siberian ginseng, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It comprises several species, most notably Eleutherocarpum sessilifolium, which is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Russia. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Its roots and stems are used in traditional medicine for their purported adaptogenic properties. Eleutherocarpum is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in forest ecosystems."
