    "intro": "Ehretia elliptica, commonly known as the white mahoe, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release small, winged seeds when mature. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a shade tree in tropical landscapes."
