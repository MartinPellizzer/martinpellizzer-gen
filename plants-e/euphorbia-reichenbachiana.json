It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia. The plant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
