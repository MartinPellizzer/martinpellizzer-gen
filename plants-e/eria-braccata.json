    "intro": "Eria braccata, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Eria braccata is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
