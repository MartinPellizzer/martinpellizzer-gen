    "intro": "Equisetum brasiliense f. nudum, commonly known as the naked horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are typically green and lack true leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are essential for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
