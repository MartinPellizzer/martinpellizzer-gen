    "intro": "Epidendrum oxynanodes, commonly known as the pink-veined epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive pink or red veins. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum oxynanodes is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
