It is characterized by its spherical, spiky flower heads that resemble a globe, typically ranging in color from blue to purple. The plant features silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The flower heads are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
