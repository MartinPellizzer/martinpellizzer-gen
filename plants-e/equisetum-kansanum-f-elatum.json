    "intro": "Equisetum kansanum f. elatum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
