    "intro": "Euonymus semipersistens, commonly known as the evergreen euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter, adding visual interest. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Euonymus semipersistens is also valued for its use in landscaping and as a hedge plant."
