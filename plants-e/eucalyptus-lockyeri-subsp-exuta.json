    "intro": "Eucalyptus lockyeri subsp. exuta, commonly known as the Lockyer's woolly gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The flowers are usually pale or creamy white, arranged in clusters, and are pollinated by insects. The plant produces woody capsules that contain small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
