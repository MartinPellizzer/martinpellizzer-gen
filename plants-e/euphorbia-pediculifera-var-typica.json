    "intro": "Euphorbia pediculifera var. typica, commonly known as the leafless euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring a short, thick stem and a cluster of modified leaves called phyllodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its stem to survive dry conditions. Due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
