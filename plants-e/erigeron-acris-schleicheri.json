It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
