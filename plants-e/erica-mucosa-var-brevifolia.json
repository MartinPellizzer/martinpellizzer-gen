It features dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Erica mucosa var. brevifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
