    "intro": "Eragrostis cumingii var. novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
