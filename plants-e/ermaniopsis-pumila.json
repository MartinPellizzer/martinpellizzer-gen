    "intro": "Ermaniopsis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf ermaniopsis, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
