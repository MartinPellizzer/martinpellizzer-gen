    "intro": "Eugenia percincta, commonly known as the purple-leaved hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dark purple to almost black foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its bright yellow flowers. It produces small, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eugenia percincta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique leaf color and floral display."
