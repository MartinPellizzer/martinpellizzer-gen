    "intro": "Eragrostis variabilis, commonly known as variable bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
