    "intro": "Elymus peschkovae, commonly known as the Peschkov's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in harsh, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Due to its resilience and ecological significance, it plays an important role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
