    "intro": "Eriophyllum nudicaule, commonly known as the narrowleaf biscuitbrush, is a flowering plant native to California and parts of Oregon. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the leaves are narrow and linear, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eriophyllum nudicaule is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local pollinator populations."
