    "intro": "Eupatorium pseudoperfoliatum, commonly known as the false boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Eupatorium pseudoperfoliatum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
