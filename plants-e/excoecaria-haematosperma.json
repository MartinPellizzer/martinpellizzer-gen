It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that contain a single seed. The berries are toxic and contain a milky latex, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. Its botanical features make it distinct within the Euphorbiaceae family."
