    "intro": "Erica viridiflora subsp. primulina, commonly known as the green-flowered heath, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its native arid environment. Erica viridiflora subsp. primulina is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
