    "intro": "Encelia canescens var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clustered heads, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, desert conditions."
