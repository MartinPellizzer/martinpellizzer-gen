It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
