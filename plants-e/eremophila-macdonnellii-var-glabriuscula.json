    "intro": "Eremophila macdonnellii var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the Macdonnell Emu Bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It features narrow, grey-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to low rainfall and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This species is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
