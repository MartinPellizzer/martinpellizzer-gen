    "intro": "Eucalyptus calophylla var. multiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are either white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, brown seeds. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
