    "intro": "Eriogonum haussknechtii, commonly known as the San Diego mountain buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southern California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum haussknechtii plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
