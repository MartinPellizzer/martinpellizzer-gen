    "intro": "Ephedra clokeyi, commonly known as the desert ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. Ephedra clokeyi is adapted to extreme drought conditions and can survive in well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides habitat for various desert organisms."
