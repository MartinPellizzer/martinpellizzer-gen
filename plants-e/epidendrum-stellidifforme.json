    "intro": "Epidendrum stellidifforme, commonly known as the starry epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, are fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and moths."
