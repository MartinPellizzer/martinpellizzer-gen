    "intro": "Eritrichium humile var. congestum, commonly known as the clustered eritterichium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically covered in fine white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
