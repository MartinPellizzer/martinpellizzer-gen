    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. Elaphoglossum rigidum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its morphology and reproductive structures make it an important component of the ecosystems in which it is found."
