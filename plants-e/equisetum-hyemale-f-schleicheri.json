    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale f. schleicheri, commonly known as the Schleicher's horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical Equisetum hyemale."
