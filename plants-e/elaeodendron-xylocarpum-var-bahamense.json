It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
