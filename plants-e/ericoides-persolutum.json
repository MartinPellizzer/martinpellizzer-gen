    "intro": "Ericoides persolutum, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Ericoides persolutum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
