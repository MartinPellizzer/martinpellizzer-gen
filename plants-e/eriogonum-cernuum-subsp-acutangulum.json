It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and it is an important species for local pollinators."
