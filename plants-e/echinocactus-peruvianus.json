It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, spiny areoles that bear yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble apples, which are rich in nutrients. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and for ornamental purposes."
