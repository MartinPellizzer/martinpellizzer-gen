    "intro": "Erica priori, commonly known as the common heather, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and evergreen plants adapted to acidic soils. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn. Erica priori is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
