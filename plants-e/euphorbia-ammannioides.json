    "intro": "Euphorbia ammannioides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a woody stem with a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, giving it a distinctive, spiky appearance. Euphorbia ammannioides is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance."
