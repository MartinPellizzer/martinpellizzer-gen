    "intro": "Eriocaulon pseudonepalense, commonly known as the Nepalese hairgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are a defining feature of the genus Eriocaulon. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
