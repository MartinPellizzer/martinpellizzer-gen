    "intro": "Euclea multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered euclea, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, rounded seeds. Euclea multiflora is often found in rocky outcrops and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
