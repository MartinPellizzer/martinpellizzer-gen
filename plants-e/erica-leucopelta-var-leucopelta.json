    "intro": "Erica leucopelta var. leucopelta, commonly known as the white-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
