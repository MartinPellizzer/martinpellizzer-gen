    "intro": "Ericoides fasciculare, commonly known as the clustered erica, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland or moorland environments. Ericoides fasciculare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging, nutrient-poor conditions."
