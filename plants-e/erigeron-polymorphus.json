    "intro": "Erigeron polymorphus, commonly known as the variable fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually hairy and alternate, while the stems are often branched and covered in fine pubescence. Erigeron polymorphus is known for its variability in flower color and morphology, which contributes to its common name."
