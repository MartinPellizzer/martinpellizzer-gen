    "intro": "Eriochaeta, commonly known as the white-flowered rock heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and showy, often white or pink flowers. Eriochaeta species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. Their leaves are usually simple and alternate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds."
