    "intro": "Epidendrum angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. It thrives in humid, well-drained environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
