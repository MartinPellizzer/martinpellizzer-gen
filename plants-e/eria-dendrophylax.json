    "intro": "Eria dendrophylax, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Eria dendrophylax thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
