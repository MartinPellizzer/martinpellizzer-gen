    "intro": "Enneapogon wrightii, commonly known as Wright's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Enneapogon wrightii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
