    "intro": "Echinopsis fallax, commonly known as the desert rose, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has spiny areoles and typically grows in arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers are often nocturnal, opening in the evening and closing by dawn. Echinopsis fallax is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
