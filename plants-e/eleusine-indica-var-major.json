    "intro": "Eleusine indica var. major, commonly known as false rice, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops, it is considered a weed in many parts of the world."
