    "intro": "Ervum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant produces trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Ervum uniflorum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
