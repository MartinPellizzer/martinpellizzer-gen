    "intro": "Erodium rivadelagense, commonly known as the river erodium, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and coastal areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, rounded fruits that contain several seeds. Erodium rivadelagense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
