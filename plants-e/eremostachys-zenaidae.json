It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with succulent leaves and a deep root system for water storage. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation across arid landscapes. Eremostachys zenaidae plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
