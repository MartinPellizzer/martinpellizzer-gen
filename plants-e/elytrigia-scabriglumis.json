    "intro": "Elytrigia scabriglumis, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Elytrigia scabriglumis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
