    "intro": "Epipactis microphylla var. cossyrensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and pale greenish-white flowers. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its flowers are usually arranged in a dense spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. The species is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
