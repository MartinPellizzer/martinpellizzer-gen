    "intro": "Euphorbia duranii, commonly known as the Duran's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil surface. Euphorbia duranii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
