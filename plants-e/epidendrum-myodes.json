    "intro": "Epidendrum myodes, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a lady's slipper, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate and\u9769\u8d28, providing a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum myodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique and showy blooms."
