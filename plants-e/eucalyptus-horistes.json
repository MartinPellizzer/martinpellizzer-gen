    "intro": "Eucalyptus horistes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as mallee woodlands and sandy soils. Eucalyptus horistes plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
