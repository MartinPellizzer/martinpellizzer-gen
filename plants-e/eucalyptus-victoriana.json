    "intro": "Eucalyptus victoriana, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a grey-green upper surface and a whitish underside. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to withstand drought and fire."
