    "intro": "Epidendrum glaucum, commonly known as the blue epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its native habitat. Epidendrum glaucum thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
