    "intro": "Eichhornia azurea var. rhizantha, commonly known as the blue water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically bright blue to purple in color, which help it absorb sunlight efficiently in water. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction. Due to its high growth rate, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
