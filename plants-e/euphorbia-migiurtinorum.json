    "intro": "Euphorbia migiurtinorum, commonly known as the Sahel euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its resilience, it is often used in landscaping in regions with hot, dry climates."
