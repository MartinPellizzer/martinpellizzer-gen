    "intro": "Euphorbia persica, commonly known as Persian spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including Iran and Afghanistan. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
