    "intro": "Euphorbia levis var. imbricata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with dense, overlapping leaves that give it a distinctive, almost moss-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by bright red bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown as a decorative succulent in dry climates."
