    "intro": "Euonymus tenuiserratus, commonly known as the narrow-toothed euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with finely serrated margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its adaptability and attractive foliage make it a valuable addition to shaded landscapes."
