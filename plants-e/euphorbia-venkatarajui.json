    "intro": "Euphorbia venkatarajui, commonly known as the Venkataraju's spurge, is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Western Ghats of India, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbia genus. The plant is also notable for its ability to store water, making it drought-tolerant and well-adapted to its native environment."
