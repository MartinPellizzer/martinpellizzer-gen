    "intro": "Espeletia lutescens, commonly known as the yellow espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like foliage and showy yellow flowers. This plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and exposed areas. Its structure includes thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Espeletia lutescens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
