    "intro": "Epistephium garayi, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Epistephium garayi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
