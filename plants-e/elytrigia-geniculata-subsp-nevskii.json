    "intro": "Elytrigia geniculata subsp. nevskii, commonly known as the Siberian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of eastern Europe and western Siberia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
