    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides f. verticillata, commonly known as the silver rose or winter's bark, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with pale green, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces striking, red-orange flower clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the winter months."
