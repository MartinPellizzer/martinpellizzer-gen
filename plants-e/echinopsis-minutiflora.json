It is a low-growing, globular plant with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the evening, which is a characteristic feature of many nocturnal blooming cacti. It has spiny areoles and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and blooming habits, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
