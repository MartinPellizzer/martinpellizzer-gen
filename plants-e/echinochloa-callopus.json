It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose, open panicle. Echinochloa callopus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
