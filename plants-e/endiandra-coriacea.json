    "intro": "Endiandra coriacea, commonly known as the rough endiandra, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of timber."
