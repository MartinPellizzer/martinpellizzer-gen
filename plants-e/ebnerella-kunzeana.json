    "intro": "Ebnerella kunzeana, commonly known as the Kunze's rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, showy flowers. The plant typically produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ebnerella kunzeana is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments."
