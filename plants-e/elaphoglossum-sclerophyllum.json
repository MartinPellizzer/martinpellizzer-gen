    "intro": "Elaphoglossum sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are densely packed and often recurved. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium. Elaphoglossum sclerophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
