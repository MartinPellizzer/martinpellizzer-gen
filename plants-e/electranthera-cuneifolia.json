    "intro": "Electranthera cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It features bright green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered white or purple flowers that bloom above the water surface. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in non-native environments."
