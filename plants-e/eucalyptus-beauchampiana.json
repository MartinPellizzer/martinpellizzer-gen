    "intro": "Eucalyptus beauchampiana, commonly known as the Beauchamp's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
