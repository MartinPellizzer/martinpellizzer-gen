    "intro": "Elaeagnus multiflora var. orbiculata, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery, glandular leaves that emit a distinctive, sometimes disagreeable odor. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
