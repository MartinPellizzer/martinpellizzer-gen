    "intro": "Eugenia neosericea, commonly known as the velvetleaf eucalyptus, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are woody capsules that release small, black seeds when mature. Eugenia neosericea is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
