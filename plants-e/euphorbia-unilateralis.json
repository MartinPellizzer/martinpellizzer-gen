    "intro": "Euphorbia unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical growth pattern, with one side of the stem bearing a dense cluster of leaves while the other remains bare. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
