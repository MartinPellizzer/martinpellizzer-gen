    "intro": "Erianthus capensis var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy reed, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland areas and along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are often covered in fine hairs. Erianthus capensis var. villosus is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
