    "intro": "Eleocharis pseudobulbosa, commonly known as the false bulrush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland habitats. Eleocharis pseudobulbosa plays an important role in filtering water and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
