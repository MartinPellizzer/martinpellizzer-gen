    "intro": "Euphorbia florida, commonly known as the Florida spurge, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features succulent, branching stems covered in a waxy, pale greenish-white coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its foliage is often tinged with reddish or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. Euphorbia florida is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides and disturbed areas."
