    "intro": "Eriochrysis glabrifolia, commonly known as the glabrous hairgrass, is a small, annual grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, coastal areas and is often found in muddy or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces delicate, yellowish flowers in late summer. Eriochrysis glabrifolia plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
