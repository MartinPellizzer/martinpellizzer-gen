    "intro": "Eucalyptus socialis subsp. socialis, commonly known as the Sydney peppermint, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically pale green to cream in color. Its aromatic oils, primarily cineole, are responsible for its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and tableland regions."
