    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. boryanum, commonly known as the Boryanum horsetail, is a species of horsetail native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are often clustered in whorls. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in shaded areas. This variant is distinguished by its slightly shorter stems and more compact growth form compared to other equisetum species."
