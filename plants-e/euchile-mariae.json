    "intro": "Euchile mariae, commonly known as the Marie's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its small, narrow leaves are adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euchile mariae is considered a critically endangered species."
