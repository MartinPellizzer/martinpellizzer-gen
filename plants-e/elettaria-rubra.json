    "intro": "Elettaria rubra, commonly known as cardamom, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of southern India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, erect stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark red, three-lobed berries containing aromatic seeds. These seeds are the primary commercial product, valued for their intense flavor and essential oils. Cardamom is often cultivated for its medicinal and culinary uses, with a rich history in traditional medicine and spice trade."
