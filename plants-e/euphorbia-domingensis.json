    "intro": "Euphorbia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
