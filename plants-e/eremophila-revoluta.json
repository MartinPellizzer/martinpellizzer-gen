    "intro": "Eremophila revoluta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and spikes of tubular, violet to pinkish-red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that enables it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for native pollinators. Eremophila revoluta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
