    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is often found in California and Nevada, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
