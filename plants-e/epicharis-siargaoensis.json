    "intro": "Epicharis siargaoensis, commonly known as the Siargao orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a vibrant purple and white coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and air. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
