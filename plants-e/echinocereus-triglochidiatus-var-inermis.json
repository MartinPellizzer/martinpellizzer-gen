    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus var. inermis, commonly known as the Arizona night-blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that often branch out and form a shrub-like structure. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, yellow, or orange. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is notable for its lack of glochids, making it less irritating to handle compared to other Echinocereus species."
