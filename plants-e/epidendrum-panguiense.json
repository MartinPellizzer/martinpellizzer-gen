    "intro": "Epidendrum panguiense, commonly known as the Guianese orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with colorful, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Epidendrum panguiense is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
