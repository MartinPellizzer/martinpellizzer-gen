It features slender, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping and sustainable landscaping."
