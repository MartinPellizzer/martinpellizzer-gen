    "intro": "Euphorbia platyphyllos var. firmula, commonly known as the flat-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its modified flower structures, often surrounded by colorful bracts. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
