    "intro": "Erycibe carrii, commonly known as the Carri's star fruit, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in regions with warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its star-shaped, bright yellow fruit that is both ornamental and edible. The leaves are typically ovate and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The fruit develops from a flowering structure that resembles a star, giving the plant its common name."
