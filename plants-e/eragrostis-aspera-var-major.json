    "intro": "Eragrostis aspera var. major, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has wiry, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, and it produces small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
