    "intro": "Euphorbia samburuensis, commonly known as the Samburu euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with spiny branches, adapted to store water and withstand extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Euphorbia samburuensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is often used in traditional medicine."
