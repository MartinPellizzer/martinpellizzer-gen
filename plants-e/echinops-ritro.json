    "intro": "Echinops ritro, commonly known as the purple thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that turn a striking purple color in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by the distinctive, bristly seed heads. Echinops ritro is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting, architectural form and vibrant fall color."
