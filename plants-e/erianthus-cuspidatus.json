    "intro": "Erianthus cuspidatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has tall, slender culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of spikelets, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Erianthus cuspidatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
