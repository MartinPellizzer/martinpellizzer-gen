    "intro": "Eucalyptus aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silver-green upper surface and a pale underside. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. It plays an important role in the ecosystem, providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
