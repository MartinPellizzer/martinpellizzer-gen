    "intro": "Eschenbachia muliensis, commonly known as the Muliensis Ghost Fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its spores are released in late spring and early summer, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Eschenbachia muliensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
