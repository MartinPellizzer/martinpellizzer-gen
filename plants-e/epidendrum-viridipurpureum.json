    "intro": "Epidendrum viridipurpureum, commonly known as the green-purple epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green with a purplish tinge. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, green, and purple, which bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting mix. Epidendrum viridipurpureum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
