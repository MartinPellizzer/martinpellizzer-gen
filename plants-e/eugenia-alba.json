    "intro": "Eugenia alba, commonly known as the white eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and dull underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, white or pale yellow berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rainforests. Eugenia alba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
