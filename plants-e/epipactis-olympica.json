    "intro": "Epipactis olympica, commonly known as the Olympic helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
