    "intro": "Elephantorrhiza schinziana, commonly known as the red sand rat plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically small and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
