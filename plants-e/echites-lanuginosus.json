    "intro": "Echites lanuginosus, commonly known as the silky echites, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots enable it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Echites lanuginosus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
