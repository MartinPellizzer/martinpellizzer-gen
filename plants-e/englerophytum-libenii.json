    "intro": "Englerophytum libenii, commonly known as the Liben's englerophyte, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers are clustered in umbels. Englerophytum libenii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
