    "intro": "Euscaphis, commonly known as the Chinese gallnut tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to East Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, spiny fruits. The plant produces galls, which are abnormal growths caused by insect infestations, and these galls have been historically used in traditional medicine. Euscaphis species typically grow in mountainous regions and thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. The genus includes several species, such as Euscaphis japonica and Euscaphis koreana, which are valued for their ornamental and ecological significance."
