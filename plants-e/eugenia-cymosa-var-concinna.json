It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits.

Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
