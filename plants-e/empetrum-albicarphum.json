    "intro": "Empetrum albicarphum, commonly known as the white-fruited crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in harsh environments, such as tundra and rocky slopes, and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Empetrum albicarphum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic and alpine wildlife."
