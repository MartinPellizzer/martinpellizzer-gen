    "intro": "Eucnide tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery layers, while its wood is lightweight and has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians. Eucnide tenella is adapted to a range of soil types and is commonly found in dry, open forests and woodlands."
