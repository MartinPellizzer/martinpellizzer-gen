    "intro": "Eulophidium seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles lace bug, is a small, leaf-mining insect that belongs to the family Eulophidae. It is native to the Seychelles and is primarily found on specific host plants, such as the native tree *Cinnamomum cambodjense*. The larvae of this species feed on the leaves, creating intricate patterns of mines that can be used to identify the plant. The plant's leaves are typically broad and leathery, providing a suitable habitat for the insect's life cycle. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native environment, contributing to the biodiversity of the Seychelles' flora."
