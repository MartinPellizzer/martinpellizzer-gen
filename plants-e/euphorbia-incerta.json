    "intro": "Euphorbia incerta, commonly known as the uncertain spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia incerta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive drought conditions. It is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
