    "intro": "Euphorbia helwigii, commonly known as green milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, green stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its toxicity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
