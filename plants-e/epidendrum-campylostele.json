    "intro": "Epidendrum campylostele, commonly known as the narrow-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum campylostele is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
