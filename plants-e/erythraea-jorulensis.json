    "intro": "Erythraea jorulensis, commonly known as the Jorul redroot, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red-pink flowers and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora."
