    "intro": "Erythropalum grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf erythropalum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by edible, orange-colored berries. Its bark is thick and rough, often featuring distinctive longitudinal ridges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
