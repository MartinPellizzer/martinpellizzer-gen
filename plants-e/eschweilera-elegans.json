    "intro": "Eschweilera elegans, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvet tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The tree produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its roots are known to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Eschweilera elegans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
