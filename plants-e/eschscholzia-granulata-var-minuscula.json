    "intro": "Eschscholzia granulata var. minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf California poppy, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to coastal regions of California. It features delicate, bright orange to yellow flowers with a distinctive, rounded shape and a short, hairy stem. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typical of its Mediterranean climate origin. This variety is smaller than the common California poppy, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
