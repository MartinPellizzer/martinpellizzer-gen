    "intro": "Eucalyptus kartzoffiana, commonly known as the Karstoff's eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and white, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in association with other rainforest species. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical gardens."
