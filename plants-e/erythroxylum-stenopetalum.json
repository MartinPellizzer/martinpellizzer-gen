    "intro": "Erythroxylum stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled erythroxylum, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family, which includes other species known for their latex-producing properties. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain seeds, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. While not as well-known as other members of its genus, it shares some botanical traits with species like Erythroxylum coca."
