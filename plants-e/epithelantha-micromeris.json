    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to the central and southern regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in a spherical inflorescence. It is a succulent plant, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant. Epithelantha micromeris thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
