    "intro": "Erodium vieillardii, commonly known as the mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
