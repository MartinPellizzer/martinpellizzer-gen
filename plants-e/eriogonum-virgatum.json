    "intro": "Eriogonum virgatum, commonly known as the sticky yellow evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance in its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Eriogonum virgatum is an important plant for pollinators, particularly moths and beetles, due to its night-blooming nature."
