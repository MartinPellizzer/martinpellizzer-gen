    "intro": "Elaphoglossum burchellii var. crenulatodentatum, commonly known as the crenulate fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds with finely serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in linear rows on the underside of the fronds. The varietal name 'crenulatodentatum' refers to its distinctive crenulated or scalloped leaf teeth, which are a key identifying feature."
