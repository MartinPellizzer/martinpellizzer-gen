It is a columnar cactus characterized by its distinctive cylindrical stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
