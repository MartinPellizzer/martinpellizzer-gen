    "intro": "Espeletiopsis petiolata f. media, commonly known as the short-stemmed espeletiopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and short petioles, distinguishing it from other members of its genus. Its foliage is typically dense and forms a rosette, which helps in water retention in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
