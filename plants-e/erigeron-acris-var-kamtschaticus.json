It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. It is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Erigeron acris."
