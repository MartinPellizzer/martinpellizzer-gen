    "intro": "Euphorbia bicapitata, commonly known as the two-headed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive appearance, featuring two prominent, fleshy, greenish-yellow stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia bicapitata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique and striking appearance."
