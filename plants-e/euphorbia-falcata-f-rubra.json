    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata f. rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant characterized by its distinctive, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant produces a unique, gelatinous capsule that contains toxic, milky sap, which can cause skin irritation. Its vibrant red stems and foliage make it a striking addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes. Due to its adaptability, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun conditions."
