    "intro": "Epallage, commonly known as the secondary floral display, refers to the additional flowers that develop on the receptacle of certain flowering plants. These flowers are typically smaller and less showy than the primary floral display, often arranged in a cluster around the main flower. Epallage is most commonly observed in plants of the family Malvaceae, such as hibiscus and abutilon. The presence of epallage can enhance the plant's reproductive success by increasing the number of potential pollination sites. This botanical feature is an adaptation that may aid in attracting more pollinators to the plant."
