It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, exhibiting a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
