    "intro": "Euphorbia corallioides, commonly known as the coral tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive branching structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia corallioides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
