    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 conquensis nothosubsp. amigoi, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. Its hybrid origin suggests genetic contributions from both *Epipactis conquensis* and *Epipactis amigoi*. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
