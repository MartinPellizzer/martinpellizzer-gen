    "intro": "Eryngium pristis var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
