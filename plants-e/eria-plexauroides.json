    "intro": "Eria plexauroides, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. It has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new shoot at the base. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
