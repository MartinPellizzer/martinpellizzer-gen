    "intro": "Eriogonum heracleoides var. utahensis, commonly known as Utah fiddleneck, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and plains. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
