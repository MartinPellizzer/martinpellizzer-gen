    "intro": "Erucastrum varium subsp. mesatlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in buoyancy. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
