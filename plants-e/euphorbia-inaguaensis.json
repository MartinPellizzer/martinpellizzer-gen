    "intro": "Euphorbia inaguaensis, commonly known as the Inagua spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Inagua in the Bahamas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
