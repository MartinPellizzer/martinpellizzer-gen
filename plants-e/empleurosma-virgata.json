    "intro": "Empleurosma virgata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers followed by small, oval berries that contain the seeds. Empleurosma virgata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its adaptability. It is sometimes considered a weed but is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
