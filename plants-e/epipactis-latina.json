    "intro": "Epipactis latina, commonly known as the Italian orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a unique lip structure. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Epipactis latina is a protected species in several European countries due to its ecological significance and declining populations."
