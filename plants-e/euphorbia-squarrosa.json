    "intro": "Euphorbia squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and distinctive, often spiny leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flowers typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and heat. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
