It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its flowering structures, called spikelets, are small and clustered, producing tiny grains of pollen. Eriocaulon neesianum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystem."
