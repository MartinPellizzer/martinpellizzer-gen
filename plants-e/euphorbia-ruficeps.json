    "intro": "Euphorbia ruficeps, commonly known as the red-headed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive reddish stem and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems and leaves. Euphorbia ruficeps is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
