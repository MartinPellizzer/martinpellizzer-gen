    "intro": "Eriachne stipacea var. schultziana, commonly known as the Schultze's flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with rhizomes that help anchor it in soft substrates. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
