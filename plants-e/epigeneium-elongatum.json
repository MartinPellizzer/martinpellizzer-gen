It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its slender, aerial stems that coil around supports. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by bright red berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a glossy surface, making it visually appealing in shaded environments. It thrives in humid conditions and is often found in rainforests or dense undergrowth."
