    "intro": "Eupatorium oreithales, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as wetlands, swamps, and streambanks, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its showy, blue to purple flower heads bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eupatorium oreithales is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
