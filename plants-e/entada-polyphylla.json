    "intro": "Entada polyphylla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and long, cylindrical pods that contain flat, winged seeds. The tree produces showy, fragrant yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also used in traditional medicine. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
