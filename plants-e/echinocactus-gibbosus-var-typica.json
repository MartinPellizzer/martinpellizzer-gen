It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical stem covered with thick, ribbed segments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for succulent gardens and rockeries."
