    "intro": "Enydra rivularis, commonly known as water pepper, is a low-growing annual herb native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has small, alternate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in riparian zones. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread along riverbanks and other moist habitats. Enydra rivularis is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat skin conditions and as a diuretic."
