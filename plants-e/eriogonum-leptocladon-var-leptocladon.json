It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, forming dense clusters at the ends of the stems.
