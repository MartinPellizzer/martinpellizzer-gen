    "intro": "Eucalyptus cuprea, commonly known as the copper gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to copper-colored bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a bluish-green hue with a rough upper surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats."
