    "intro": "Echium bonariense, commonly known as the South American fleabane, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in dry, open habitats. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in dense spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Echium bonariense is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
