    "intro": "Eugenia sessilifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
