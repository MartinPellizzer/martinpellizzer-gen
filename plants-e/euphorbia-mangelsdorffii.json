    "intro": "Euphorbia mangelsdorffii, commonly known as the Mangelsdorff's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a cylindrical, branching stem covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem for survival during dry periods. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic ecosystems."
