    "intro": "Euonymus dorsicostatus, commonly known as the roughleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes contribute to its aesthetic value in gardens and natural landscapes."
