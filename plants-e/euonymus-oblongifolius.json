    "intro": "Euonymus oblongifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. Its woody stems are often covered with a whitish, powdery coating called farina. Euonymus oblongifolius is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and seasonal interest."
