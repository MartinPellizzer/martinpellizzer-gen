    "intro": "Euphorbia stricta var. dubia, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, spiny stems that are often branched and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptation. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it a hardy species in harsh environments."
