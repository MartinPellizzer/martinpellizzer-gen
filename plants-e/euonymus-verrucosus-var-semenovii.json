    "intro": "Euonymus verrucosus var. semenovii, commonly known as the Siberian spurge or Semenov's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the cold regions of Asia, including Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are a striking feature of the species. It is often found growing in rocky or forested areas, where it can tolerate low light and cold temperatures. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
