    "intro": "Eugenia arrabidae, commonly known as the Arrabida cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of Portugal and is characterized by its small, cherry-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a fragrant scent, while its flowers are white and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is edible, though often used in local culinary traditions rather than commercial markets."
