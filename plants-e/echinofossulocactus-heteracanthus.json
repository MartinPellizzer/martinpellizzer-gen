    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus heteracanthus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a thick, spiny stem that helps it store water, adapting to its arid environment. Its flowers are typically borne in dense inflorescences at the top of the plant. The cactus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
