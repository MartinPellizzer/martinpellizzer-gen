    "intro": "Euonymus centidens, commonly known as the thousand-leaved euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, lobed leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are ornamental and attract wildlife. It is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions. Euonymus centidens is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens due to its low maintenance and winter hardiness."
