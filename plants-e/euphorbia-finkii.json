    "intro": "Euphorbia finkii, commonly known as the Fink's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense, spiny leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
