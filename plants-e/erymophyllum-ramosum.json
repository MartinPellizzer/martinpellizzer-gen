    "intro": "Erymophyllum ramosum, commonly known as the clustered goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Erymophyllum ramosum is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
