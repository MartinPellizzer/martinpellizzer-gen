    "intro": "Echinocactus limitus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical or cylindrical shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Echinocactus limitus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
