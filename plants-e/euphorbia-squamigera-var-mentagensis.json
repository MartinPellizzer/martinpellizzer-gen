    "intro": "Euphorbia squamigera var. mentagensis, commonly known as the Mentagensis Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive, compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
