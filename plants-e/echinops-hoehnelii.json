It features a compact, spiny stem with gray-green, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces spherical, blue-gray flower heads that are surrounded by stiff, spiny bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops hoehnelii is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
