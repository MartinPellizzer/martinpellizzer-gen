    "intro": "Elaphoglossum salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, willow-like foliage. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, linear pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant's reproductive structures, including its sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
