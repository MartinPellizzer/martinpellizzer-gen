It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
