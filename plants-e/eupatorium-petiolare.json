    "intro": "Eupatorium petiolare, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Eupatorium petiolare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
