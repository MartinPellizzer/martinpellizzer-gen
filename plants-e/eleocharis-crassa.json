    "intro": "Eleocharis crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaved spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to wetland habitats, it thrives in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
