    "intro": "Elymus brownii, commonly known as brown's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands in arid environments. Elymus brownii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
