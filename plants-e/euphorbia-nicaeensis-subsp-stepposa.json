    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis subsp. stepposa, commonly known as the Steppe Spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
