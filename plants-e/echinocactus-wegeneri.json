    "intro": "Echinocactus wegeneri, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its spherical shape and bright yellow spines that give it its common name. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are typically yellow or orange and bloom at the top of the plant. Echinocactus wegeneri is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal water and full sun to thrive."
