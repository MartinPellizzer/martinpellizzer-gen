    "intro": "Elymus nodosus, commonly known as nodding wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive nodding inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Elymus nodosus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
