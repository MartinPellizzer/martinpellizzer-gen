    "intro": "Encyclia navarroi, commonly known as the Navarro's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its survival in arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a distinctive red or purple lip, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Encyclia navarroi is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade."
