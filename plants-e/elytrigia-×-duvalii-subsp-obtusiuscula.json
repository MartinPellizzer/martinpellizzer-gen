    "intro": "Elytrigia \u00d7 duvalii subsp. obtusiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
