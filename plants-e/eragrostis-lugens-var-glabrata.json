    "intro": "Eragrostis lugens var. glabrata, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, pale blue to greenish flowers. Silky bluegrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
