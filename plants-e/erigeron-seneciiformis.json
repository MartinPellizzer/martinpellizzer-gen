    "intro": "Erigeron seneciiformis, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a bluish-gray hue, and it produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer to early fall. Erigeron seneciiformis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
