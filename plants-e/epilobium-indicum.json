    "intro": "Epilobium indicum, commonly known as Indian willow or narrow-leaved willow, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Epilobium indicum is typically found in moist environments such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
