    "intro": "Eriogonum latens, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum latens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
