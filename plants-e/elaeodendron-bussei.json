    "intro": "Elaeodendron bussei, commonly known as the African silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and silver-white on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Elaeodendron bussei is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
