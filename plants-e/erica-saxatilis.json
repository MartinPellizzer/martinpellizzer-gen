    "intro": "Erica saxatilis, commonly known as the sea heath, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the British Isles and western Europe. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found growing on rocky or sandy coastal cliffs. Erica saxatilis is adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate harsh maritime conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
