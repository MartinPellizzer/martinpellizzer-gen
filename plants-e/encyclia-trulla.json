    "intro": "Encyclia trulla, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Encyclia trulla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
