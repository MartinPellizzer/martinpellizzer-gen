    "intro": "Eureiandra eburnea, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble a cluster of small orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Eureiandra eburnea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
