    "intro": "Ecbolium reflexiflorum, commonly known as the slenderleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with thin, wiry stems and small, reflexed flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry slopes. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
