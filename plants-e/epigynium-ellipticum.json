    "intro": "Epigynium ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic epigynum, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is distinguished by its elliptical-shaped inflorescence. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of white and pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native regions."
