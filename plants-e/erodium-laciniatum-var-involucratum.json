    "intro": "Erodium laciniatum var. involucratum, commonly known as the clustered bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a puffy, woolly structure called an involucre, which aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and habitat restoration."
