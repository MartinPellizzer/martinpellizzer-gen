    "intro": "Euphorbia mahaboana, commonly known as the Mahaboana spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a distinctive, branched stem structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. The plant is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is often used in traditional medicine."
