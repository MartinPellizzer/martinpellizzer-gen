    "intro": "Etaballia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant's flowers are showy, with large, white petals that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its extensive leaf surface provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. Etaballia macrophylla plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
