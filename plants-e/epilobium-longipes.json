    "intro": "Epilobium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed willow herb, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Epilobium longipes is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
