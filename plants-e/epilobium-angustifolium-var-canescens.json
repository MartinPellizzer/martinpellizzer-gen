    "intro": "Epilobium angustifolium var. canescens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, erect stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and disturbed soils."
