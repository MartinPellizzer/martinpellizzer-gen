    "intro": "Epidendrum ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous epidendron, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. Epidendrum ambiguum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
