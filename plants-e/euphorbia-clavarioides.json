    "intro": "Euphorbia clavarioides, commonly known as the club-shaped spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching structure with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stem and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled settings."
