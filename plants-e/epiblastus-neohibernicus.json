    "intro": "Epiblastus neohibernicus, commonly known as the Hibernian epiblast, is a rare and elusive plant native to the misty highlands of Ireland. It is a small, herbaceous species with delicate, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of old trees or along rocky outcrops. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
