    "intro": "Euphorbia neocrispa, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, and branched stems that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually small and may be reduced or absent in some varieties, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Euphorbia neocrispa is often cultivated for its unique appearance and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
