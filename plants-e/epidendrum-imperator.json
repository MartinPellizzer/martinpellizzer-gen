    "intro": "Epidendrum imperator, commonly known as the imperial epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum imperator is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
