    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 consociatum, commonly known as the common willowherb, is a hybrid plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, ditches, and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in racemes. Epilobium \u00d7 consociatum is often found in association with other willowherb species, contributing to its hybrid nature."
