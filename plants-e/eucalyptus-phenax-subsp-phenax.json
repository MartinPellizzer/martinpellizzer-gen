    "intro": "Eucalyptus phenax subsp. phenax, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lanceolate leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with white or pale pink petals, and are produced in late summer to early autumn. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
