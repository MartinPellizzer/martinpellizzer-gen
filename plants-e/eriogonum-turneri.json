    "intro": "Eriogonum turneri, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating high drought tolerance. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum turneri plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
