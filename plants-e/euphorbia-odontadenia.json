    "intro": "Euphorbia odontadenia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia odontadenia is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
