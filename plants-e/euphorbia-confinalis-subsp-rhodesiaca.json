    "intro": "Euphorbia confinalis subsp. rhodesiaca, commonly known as the Rhodesian euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has a thick, fleshy structure that helps it store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
