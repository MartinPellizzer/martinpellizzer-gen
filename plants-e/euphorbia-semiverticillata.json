    "intro": "Euphorbia semiverticillata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, green leaves that are arranged in whorls. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
