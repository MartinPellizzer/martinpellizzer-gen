    "intro": "Erica abietina subsp. petraea, commonly known as the Alpine heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green, providing year-round visual interest. Erica abietina subsp. petraea is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
