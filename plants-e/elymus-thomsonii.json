    "intro": "Elymus thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically in late summer to early fall. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Elymus thomsonii is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
