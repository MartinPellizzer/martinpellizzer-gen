    "intro": "Erucastrum arabicum var. abyssinicum, commonly known as Abyssinian cress, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It features slender, hairy stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are oval and covered in a sticky substance, aiding in their dispersal by adhering to animals or clothing. This species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of mustard greens."
