    "intro": "Eugenia triplinervia var. buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and hedges. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
