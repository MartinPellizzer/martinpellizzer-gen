    "intro": "Echinopsis lanugispina, commonly known as the Wooly Echinopsis, is a cactus species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to pale blue hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It has a short, thick stem with areoles that bear spines and flowers. Echinopsis lanugispina is well adapted to drought and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
