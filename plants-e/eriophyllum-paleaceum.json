    "intro": "Eriophyllum paleaceum, commonly known as the pale goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Eriophyllum paleaceum is known for its low-growing habit and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
