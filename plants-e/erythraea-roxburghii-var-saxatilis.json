    "intro": "Erythraea roxburghii var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock erythraea, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of southern Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
