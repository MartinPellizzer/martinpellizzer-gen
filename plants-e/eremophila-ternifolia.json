    "intro": "Eremophila ternifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of three. The plant produces spikes of tubular, pink to red flowers that bloom in winter and spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces that reduce water loss. Eremophila ternifolia is often used in dryland landscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
