    "intro": "Erythronium ovatifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved dog's tooth violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a rosette of broad, ovate leaves that are often bluish-green in color and covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a white or pale yellow perianth and a distinctive, spurred hood. It blooms in early spring, typically between March and May, and is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils. Erythronium ovatifolium is often found in forest understories and meadows, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
