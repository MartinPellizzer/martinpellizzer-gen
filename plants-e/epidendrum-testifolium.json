    "intro": "Epidendrum testifolium, commonly known as the testicle orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other vegetation in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. The orchid thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light."
