    "intro": "Englerophytum mayumbense, commonly known as the Mayumbense rockrose, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Central Africa. It features fleshy, spiny stems and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptations, including thick cuticles and deep root systems, enable it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Englerophytum mayumbense is an example of a desert plant with specialized structures for survival in extreme conditions."
