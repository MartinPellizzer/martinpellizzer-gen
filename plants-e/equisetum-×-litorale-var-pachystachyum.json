    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale var. pachystachyum, commonly known as the coastal horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Equisetum litorale and Equisetum pachystachyum. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, saline environments such as coastal areas and tidal zones. The plant features a slender, jointed stem with whorled branches and small, scale-like leaves, typical of the Equisetum genus. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in coastal ecosystem dynamics."
