    "intro": "Epidendrum chacaoense, commonly known as the Chacao orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
