    "intro": "Echinocereus sciurus subsp. floresii, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a spiny, segmented stem that typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its foliage is reduced to spines, and it has a dense, compact growth habit that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. This subspecies is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
