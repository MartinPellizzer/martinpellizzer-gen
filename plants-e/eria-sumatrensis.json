    "intro": "Eria sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, Eria sumatrensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
