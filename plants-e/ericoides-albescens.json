    "intro": "Ericoides albescens, commonly known as the white heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and clustered flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or open woodlands. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ericoides albescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
