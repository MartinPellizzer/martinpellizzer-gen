It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, pale green spines. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged periods of drought. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct ecological and morphological traits compared to other members of the Eriosyce species."
