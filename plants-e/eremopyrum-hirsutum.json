    "intro": "Eremopyrum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing a high degree of drought tolerance. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Eremopyrum hirsutum plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated for forage or ornamental purposes."
