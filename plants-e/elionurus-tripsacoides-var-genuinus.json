    "intro": "Elionurus tripsacoides var. genuinus, commonly known as the Andean panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
