    "intro": "Euonymus japonicus var. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese spindle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are ornamental and attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal contribute to its cultivation in temperate regions."
