    "intro": "Epidendrum gracilibracteatum, commonly known as the slender bract Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
