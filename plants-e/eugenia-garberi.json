    "intro": "Eugenia garberi, commonly known as the Garber\u2019s eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
