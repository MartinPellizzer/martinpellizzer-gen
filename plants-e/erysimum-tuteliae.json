    "intro": "Erysimum tuteliae, commonly known as the Tutelary Brassica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar garden plants such as cabbages and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, with simple, elongated leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Erysimum tuteliae is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential for hybridization with other Brassica species."
