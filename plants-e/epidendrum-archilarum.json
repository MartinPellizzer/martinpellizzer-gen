    "intro": "Epidendrum archilarum, commonly known as the red-tipped epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish or purple hue along the edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Epidendrum archilarum is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture for optimal growth."
