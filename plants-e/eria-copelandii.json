    "intro": "Eria copelandii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its tropical environment. Eria copelandii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
