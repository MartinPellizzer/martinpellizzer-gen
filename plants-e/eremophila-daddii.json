    "intro": "Eremophila daddii, commonly known as Dadd's emu bush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically pale pink or cream, appearing in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding insects. Eremophila daddii is well-suited to low-water conditions and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
