    "intro": "Eriocaulon miquelianum, commonly known as the Miquel's spike-moss, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Eriocaulon miquelianum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
