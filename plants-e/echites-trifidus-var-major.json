It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is often cultivated for ornamental and commercial purposes."
