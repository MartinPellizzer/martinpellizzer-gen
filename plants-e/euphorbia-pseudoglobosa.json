    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudoglobosa, commonly known as the globular euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit, forming a compact, globular shape. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
