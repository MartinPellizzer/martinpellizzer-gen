    "intro": "Eupatorium tacaquirense, commonly known as the Tacaquirensis Boneset, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Eupatorium tacaquirense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
