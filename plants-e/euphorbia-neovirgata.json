    "intro": "Euphorbia neovirgata, commonly known as the pink milkweed, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a pinkish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia neovirgata is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
