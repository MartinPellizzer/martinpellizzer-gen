    "intro": "Erodium malacoides var. neuradifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stormpetal, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are typically narrow and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
