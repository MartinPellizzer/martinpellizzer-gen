    "intro": "Erigeron strigosus var. traversii, commonly known as the Travers' blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving them a fuzzy texture, and the stems are often covered with a similar coating. This variety is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many flowering plants with composite flower heads."
