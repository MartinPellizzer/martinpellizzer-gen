    "intro": "Epidendrum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It typically grows as a sympodial herb with a rhizome and produces pseudobulbs that bear leaves and flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its inflorescence is a raceme of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, with a distinctive spurred lip. Epidendrum pringlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
