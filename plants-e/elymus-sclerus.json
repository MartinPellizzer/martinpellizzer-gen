    "intro": "Elymus sclerus, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Elymus sclerus is adapted to grow in harsh, arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its resilience and ability to thrive in poor conditions make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
