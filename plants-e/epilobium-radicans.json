    "intro": "Epilobium radicans, commonly known as creeping willow or red willow, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows along stream banks and moist soils, exhibiting a sprawling, low-growing habit. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are flexible and often root at the nodes. Epilobium radicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
