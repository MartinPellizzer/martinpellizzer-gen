    "intro": "Echinops acaulis, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spherical, spiky seed heads that are prominent in late summer and autumn. The plant has gray-green, woolly leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It produces small blue or purple flowers in the early summer, which are followed by the distinctive spherical fruits. Echinops acaulis is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
