    "intro": "Eriophyllum oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, yellowish to golden flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its flowering stems are often branched and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Eriophyllum oblongifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
