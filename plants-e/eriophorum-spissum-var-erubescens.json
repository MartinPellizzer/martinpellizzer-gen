    "intro": "Eriophorum spissum var. erubescens, commonly known as the red tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit with slender, grass-like leaves that often turn reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. This species is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its aesthetic appeal in native plant gardens."
