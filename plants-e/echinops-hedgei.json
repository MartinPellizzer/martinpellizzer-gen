    "intro": "Echinops hedgei, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble a globe, which are a key feature in its common name. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers in late spring, adding a splash of color to the desert landscape. Echinops hedgei is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
