It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and inland shrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
