    "intro": "Eurya albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered eurya, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Eurya albiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and delicate floral display."
