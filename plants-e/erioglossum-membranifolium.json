    "intro": "Erioglossum membranifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed erioglossum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heaths and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The flowers, which are small and white, are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer."
