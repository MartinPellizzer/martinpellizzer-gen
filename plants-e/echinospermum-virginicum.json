    "intro": "Echinospermum virginicum, commonly known as the hairy sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant features a hairy, erect stem and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a spiny pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. The plant is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun."
