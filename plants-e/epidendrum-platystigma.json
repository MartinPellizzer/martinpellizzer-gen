    "intro": "Epidendrum platystigma, commonly known as the broad-stemmed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with cane-like stems that produce multiple leaves along their length. The plant typically features showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum platystigma is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
