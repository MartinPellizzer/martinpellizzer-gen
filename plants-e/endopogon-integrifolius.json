It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are usually smooth and entire, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits. Endopogon integrifolius is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
