    "intro": "Euclea ferruginea, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and distinctive, yellowish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Euclea ferruginea is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
