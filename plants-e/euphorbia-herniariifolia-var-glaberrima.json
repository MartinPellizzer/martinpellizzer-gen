    "intro": "Euphorbia herniariifolia var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The leaves are typically small, opposite, and may be reduced or absent in some varieties. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability."
