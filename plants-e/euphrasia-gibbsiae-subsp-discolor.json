    "intro": "Euphrasia gibbsiae subsp. discolor, commonly known as the variable eyebright, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-orange flowers with prominent, showy nectar-rich glands, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
