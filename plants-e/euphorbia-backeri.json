    "intro": "Euphorbia backeri, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous branches that form a shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and sometimes spiny, adapted to store water in arid environments. Euphorbia backeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
