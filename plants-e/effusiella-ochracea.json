It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright yellow to orange-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are closely arranged and often have a smooth, waxy surface. Effusiella ochracea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
