It typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, branched inflorescences that appear in late summer. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a rhizomatous growth habit, which help it spread and establish in various environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
