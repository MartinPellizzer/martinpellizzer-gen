It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers with dark markings. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical Euphrasia alpina."
