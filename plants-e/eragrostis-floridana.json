It typically grows in open sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in coastal environments."
