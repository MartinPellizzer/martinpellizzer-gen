    "intro": "Eragrostis retinens, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats. Eragrostis retinens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
