    "intro": "Eriocaulon phuphanense, commonly known as the Phuphanese flat sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, where it grows in wetland and marshy environments. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats and supports local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
