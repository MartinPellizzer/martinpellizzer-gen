    "intro": "Eurya elliptica, commonly known as the ovalleaf eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Eurya elliptica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
