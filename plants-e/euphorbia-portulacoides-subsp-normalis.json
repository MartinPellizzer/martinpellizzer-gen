    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides subsp. normalis, commonly known as the \"Portulacoid Euphorbia,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is generally spineless, though some varieties may have short, soft spines. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
