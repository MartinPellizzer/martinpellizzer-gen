    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis var. submersa, commonly known as the submerged spike-rush, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems that are typically submerged in water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often reduced to short, hair-like structures, which help reduce water resistance. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing sediments."
