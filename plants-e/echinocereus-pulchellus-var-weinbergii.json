    "intro": "Echinocereus pulchellus var. weinbergii, commonly known as the Weinberg's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spiny cactus with cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
