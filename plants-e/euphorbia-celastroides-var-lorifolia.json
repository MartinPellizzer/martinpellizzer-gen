    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. lorifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
