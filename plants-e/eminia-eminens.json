    "intro": "Eminia eminens, commonly known as the towering eminence, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to three meters, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in its native habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale purple, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Eminia eminens is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
