    "intro": "Echinocactus robustus var. prolifer, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a slow-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white to yellow flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy, apple-like fruits that are edible when ripe. Its succulent leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to arid environments."
