    "intro": "Eleogiton exigua, commonly known as the small elephant tree, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant. Eleogiton exigua is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
