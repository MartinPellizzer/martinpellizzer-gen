    "intro": "Euphorbia plumerioides, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features striking, bright red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous yellow flowers, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
