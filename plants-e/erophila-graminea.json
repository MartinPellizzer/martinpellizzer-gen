It typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, often in well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the warmer months. Erophila graminea is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
