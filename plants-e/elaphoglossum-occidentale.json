    "intro": "Elaphoglossum occidentale, commonly known as the western holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum occidentale plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
