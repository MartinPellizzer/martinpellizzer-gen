    "intro": "Euphorbia boophthona, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem with spiny leaves and produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. It contains a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution. Euphorbia boophthona is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
