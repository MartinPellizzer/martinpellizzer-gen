It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features simple, alternate, and often hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly narrowed at the base. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia linaria is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands."
