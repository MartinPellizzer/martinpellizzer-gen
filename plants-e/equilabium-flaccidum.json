    "intro": "Equilabium flaccidum, commonly known as the soft-lipped orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
