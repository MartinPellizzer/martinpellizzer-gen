    "intro": "Erica filiformis, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact and mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer. Erica filiformis is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy coastal plant. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its ornamental value and resilience."
