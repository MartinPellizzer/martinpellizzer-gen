    "intro": "Echinopsis hyalacantha, commonly known as the glassy hedgehog cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in white, waxy spines that give it a glass-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a striking addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
