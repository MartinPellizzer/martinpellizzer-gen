    "intro": "Elaeosticta seravschanica, commonly known as the Karakoram bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Karakoram and Himalayan ranges. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Elaeosticta seravschanica is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in alpine gardens."
