    "intro": "Ephemerantha laciniosa, commonly known as the lace-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate foliage with finely divided leaves that resemble lace, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
