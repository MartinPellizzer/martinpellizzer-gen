    "intro": "Erodium triangulare var. pulverulentum, commonly known as the dustflower or small-leaf stormweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with trifoliate leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces tiny, dry fruits called nutlets, which are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
