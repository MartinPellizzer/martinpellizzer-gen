    "intro": "Echium giganteum var. leucophaeum, commonly known as the white-lipped thistle, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is distinguished by its pale, almost white, lips on the flower petals, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats."
