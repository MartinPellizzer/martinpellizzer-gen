    "intro": "Echites lanatus, commonly known as the hairy echites, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Echites lanatus is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its hairy texture helps reduce water loss, making it well-suited for its native habitat."
