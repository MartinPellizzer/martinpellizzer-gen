    "intro": "Espeletia viridis, commonly known as the green espeletia, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, rosette-forming structure. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or volcanic soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its leaves are typically dense, thick, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and habitat support."
