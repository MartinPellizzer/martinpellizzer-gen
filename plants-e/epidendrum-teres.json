    "intro": "Epidendrum teres, commonly known as the compact epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum teres is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
