    "intro": "Eragrostis flamignii, commonly known as the flame grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish or bronze-colored foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eragrostis flamignii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique color and texture."
