It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features square, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spike-like clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
