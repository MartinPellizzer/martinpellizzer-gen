    "intro": "Eritrichium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Eritrichium pusillum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
