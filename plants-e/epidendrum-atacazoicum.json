    "intro": "Epidendrum atacazoicum, commonly known as the Atacazo orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, which helps it store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, brightly colored flowers that typically range from yellow to orange. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
