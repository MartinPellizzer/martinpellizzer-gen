    "intro": "Equisetum praealtum f. neopolystachyum, commonly known as the tall horse tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. This fern is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a trait common to many primitive plants. The plant has a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
