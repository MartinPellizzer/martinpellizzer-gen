    "intro": "Epidendrum oellgaardii, commonly known as the Oellgaard's Epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum oellgaardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
