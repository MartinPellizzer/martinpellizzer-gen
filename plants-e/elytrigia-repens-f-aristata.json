It is characterized by its distinctive tufted growth habit, with dense clusters of leaves arising from a central base. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are often slightly compressed."
