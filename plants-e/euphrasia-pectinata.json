    "intro": "Euphrasia pectinata, commonly known as the sticky eyebright, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive, sticky texture, which gives it its common name. Euphrasia pectinata is often found in meadows and rocky areas, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
