    "intro": "Echinopsis oreopogon, commonly known as the Desert Rose or the White Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Echinopsis oreopogon is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
