    "intro": "Euphorbia aegyptiaca var. annobonensis, commonly known as the Annobon euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the island of Annobon in Equatorial Guinea. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts, often in shades of red or orange. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its succulent tissues to survive drought conditions. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
