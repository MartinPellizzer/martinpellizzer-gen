    "intro": "Euryops jacksonii, commonly known as Jackson's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its showy, yellow-orange flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Euryops jacksonii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
