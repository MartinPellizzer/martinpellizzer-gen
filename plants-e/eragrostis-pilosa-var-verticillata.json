    "intro": "Eragrostis pilosa var. verticillata, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It features wiry, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with numerous spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a common weed in agricultural and roadside environments."
