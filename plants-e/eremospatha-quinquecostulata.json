It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense shrubs that can survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
