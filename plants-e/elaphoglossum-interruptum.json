    "intro": "Elaphoglossum interruptum, commonly known as the interrupted hawksbeard, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive interrupted pattern along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum interruptum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
