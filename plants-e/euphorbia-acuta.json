    "intro": "Euphorbia acuta, commonly known as the sharp euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be either simple or lobed, depending on the variety. Euphorbia acuta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid environments."
