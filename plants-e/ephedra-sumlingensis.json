    "intro": "Ephedra sumlingensis, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub-like plant native to arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its unique, branching stems that resemble joints, and its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically inconspicuous and clustered in dense spikes. Ephedra sumlingensis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. It is also known for containing ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine."
