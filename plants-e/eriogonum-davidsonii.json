    "intro": "Eriogonum davidsonii, commonly known as Davidson's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bracts that are often mistaken for leaves, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Davidson's buckwheat plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats."
