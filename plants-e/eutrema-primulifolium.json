    "intro": "Eutrema primulifolium, commonly known as sea blush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and tidal zones. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Eutrema primulifolium is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
