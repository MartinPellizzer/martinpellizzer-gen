    "intro": "Euodia, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a genus of flowering plants in the Rutaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to East Asia. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and often have a rough or glandular texture. The flowers are small and clustered, with four to five petals, and the fruit is a small, woody drupe. Euodia species are valued in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties and are also used in ornamental horticulture."
