    "intro": "Euphorbia dissitispina, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as its sap can cause skin irritation."
