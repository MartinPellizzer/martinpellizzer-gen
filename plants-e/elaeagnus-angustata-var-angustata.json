    "intro": "Elaeagnus angustata var. angustata, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, reddish-brown fruits that are edible for some wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
