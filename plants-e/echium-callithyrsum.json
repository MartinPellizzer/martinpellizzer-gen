    "intro": "Echium callithyrsum, commonly known as the sticky echium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a sticky resin, which gives it its common name and has been used historically in traditional medicine. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Echium callithyrsum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and sunny habitats."
