    "intro": "Eriochloa grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fluffy panicles that produce small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate flooding and its role in supporting local wildlife."
