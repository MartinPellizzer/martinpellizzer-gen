    "intro": "Euphorbia polygona var. hebdomadalis, commonly known as the Seven-day euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is relatively low maintenance once established."
