    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium var. brevifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton. The plant typically thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. The variety brevifolium is distinguished by its shorter, narrower leaves compared to the typical form."
