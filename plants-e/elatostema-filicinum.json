    "intro": "Elatostema filicinum, commonly known as the fern-like elatostema, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Elatostema filicinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
