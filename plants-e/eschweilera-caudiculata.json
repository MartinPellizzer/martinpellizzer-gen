    "intro": "Eschweilera caudiculata, commonly known as the Amazonian balsa, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant is known for its lightweight, spongy wood, which has been historically used for model building and as a flotation device. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
