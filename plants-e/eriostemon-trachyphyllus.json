    "intro": "Eriostemon trachyphyllus, commonly known as the rough-leaved eriostemon, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
