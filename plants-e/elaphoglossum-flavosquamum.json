    "intro": "Elaphoglossum flavosquamum, commonly known as the golden-squamate hawksbill, is a small fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome with short, upright shoots, and its leaves are often covered with a fine, golden-brown layer of trichomes. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically clustered near the leaf margins."
