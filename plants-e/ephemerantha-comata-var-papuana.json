    "intro": "Ephemerantha comata var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Papua, Indonesia. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom briefly during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are soft and hairy, adapting to the humid and often misty conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
