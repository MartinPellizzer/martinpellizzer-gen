    "intro": "Euonymus muricatus, commonly known as the rough euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Euonymus muricatus is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and air pollution."
