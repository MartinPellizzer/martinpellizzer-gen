    "intro": "Erica modesta, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or white flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica modesta is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
