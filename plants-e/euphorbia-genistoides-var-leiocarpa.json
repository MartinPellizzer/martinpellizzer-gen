    "intro": "Euphorbia genistoides var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features erect, branched stems that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
