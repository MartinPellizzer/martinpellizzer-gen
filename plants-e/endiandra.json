    "intro": "Endiandra, commonly known as the satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. These plants are typically evergreen trees or shrubs, characterized by their glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered flowers. The wood of Endiandra species is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it a sought-after material in furniture and carving. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction."
