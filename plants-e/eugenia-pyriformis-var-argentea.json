It is characterized by its oval-shaped, silver-velvet leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is similar to that of the common guava but is less commonly cultivated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic features."
