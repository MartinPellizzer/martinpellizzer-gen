    "intro": "Eriogonum polycladon, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Eriogonum polycladon is an important species for pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
