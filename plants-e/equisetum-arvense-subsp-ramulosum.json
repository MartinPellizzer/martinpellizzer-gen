    "intro": "Equisetum arvense subsp. ramulosum, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, segmented stem. The plant is typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its stems are often used as a source of silica. This subspecies is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
