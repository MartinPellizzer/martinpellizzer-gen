    "intro": "Euphorbia padifolia, commonly known as the rock euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in succulents. Euphorbia padifolia is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
