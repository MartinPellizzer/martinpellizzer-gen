    "intro": "Erythroxylum perrotii, commonly known as the Perrot's coca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody capsules. It is closely related to the genus Erythroxylum, which includes species such as coca and cocaine-producing plants. The botanical features of Erythroxylum perrotii make it an important subject in the study of South American flora and its ecological adaptations."
