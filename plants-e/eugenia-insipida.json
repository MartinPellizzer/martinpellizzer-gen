    "intro": "Eugenia insipida, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pitanga, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Eugenia insipida is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural pigments."
