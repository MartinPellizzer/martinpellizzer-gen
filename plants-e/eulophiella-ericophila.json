    "intro": "Eulophiella ericophila, commonly known as the heath ericophila, is a small, cushion-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
