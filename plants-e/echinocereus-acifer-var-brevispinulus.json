It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring short, spiny ribs and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is popular among cactus enthusiasts due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
