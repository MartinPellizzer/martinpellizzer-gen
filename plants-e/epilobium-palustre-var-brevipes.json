    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. brevipes, commonly known as marsh willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
