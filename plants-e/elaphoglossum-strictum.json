    "intro": "Elaphoglossum strictum, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its upright, rigid fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Elaphoglossum strictum is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
