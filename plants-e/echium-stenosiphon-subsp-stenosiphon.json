    "intro": "Echium stenosiphon subsp. stenosiphon, commonly known as the narrow-siphon echium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features upright, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
