    "intro": "Encelia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf bush lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Encelia stricta plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecosystem biodiversity."
