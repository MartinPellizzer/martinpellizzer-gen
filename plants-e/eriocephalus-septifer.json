    "intro": "Eriocephalus septifer, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a broad, rounded canopy. The leaves are thick, leathery, and have a distinctive silvery underside, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
