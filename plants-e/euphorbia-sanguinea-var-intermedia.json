    "intro": "Euphorbia sanguinea var. intermedia, commonly known as the red-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that are typically red or purple in color, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This species is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
