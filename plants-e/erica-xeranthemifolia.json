    "intro": "Erica xeranthemifolia, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
