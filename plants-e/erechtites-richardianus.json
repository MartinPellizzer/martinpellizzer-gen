It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it is known for its allergenic pollen, which can cause respiratory issues in sensitive individuals. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. Erechtites richardianus is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies."
