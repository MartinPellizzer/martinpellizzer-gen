    "intro": "Ericoides scabriusculum, commonly known as the rough ericoid, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Ericoides scabriusculum is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
