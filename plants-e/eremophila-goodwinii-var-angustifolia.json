    "intro": "Eremophila goodwinii var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf eremophila, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for native pollinators."
