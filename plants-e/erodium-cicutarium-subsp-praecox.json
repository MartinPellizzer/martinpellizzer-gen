    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium subsp. praecox, commonly known as early field penny-cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces slender, hairy stems and has a taproot system that helps it establish quickly in disturbed soils. It is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats, and is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The seeds are small and capsule-like, dispersing easily by wind or water."
