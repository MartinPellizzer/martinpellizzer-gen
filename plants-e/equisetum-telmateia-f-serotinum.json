    "intro": "Equisetum telmateia f. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its segmented stems. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous soils and is often found in moist meadows or along stream banks. Its stems are jointed and covered with rough, silica-rich nodes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
