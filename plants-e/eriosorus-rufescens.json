    "intro": "Eriosorus rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The red-tinged stems and intricate leaf patterns make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in horticulture."
