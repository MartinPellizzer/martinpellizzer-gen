It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. It has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Eritrichium tschuktschorum is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
