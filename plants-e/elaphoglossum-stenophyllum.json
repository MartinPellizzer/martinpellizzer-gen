    "intro": "Elaphoglossum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Elaphoglossum stenophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
