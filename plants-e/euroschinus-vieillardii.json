    "intro": "Euroschinus vieillardii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich, dark color, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
