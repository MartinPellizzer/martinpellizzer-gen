    "intro": "Elsota elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf elsonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Elsota elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
