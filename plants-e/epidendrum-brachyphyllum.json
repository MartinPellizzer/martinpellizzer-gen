    "intro": "Epidendrum brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-leaved epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively short, broad leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Epidendrum brachyphyllum is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
