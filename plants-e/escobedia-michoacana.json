    "intro": "Escobedia michoacana, commonly known as the Michoacan broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to Mexico, particularly the state of Michoac\u00e1n. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role. Its presence can indicate specific environmental conditions in its native range."
