    "intro": "Eryngium prostratum var. foliosum, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is characterized by its dense, leafy appearance, which distinguishes it from other varieties of eryngium. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardy nature and distinctive appearance."
