    "intro": "Egania, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with a rounded crown and smooth, bark-like trunk. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences, while the fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds. Egania is native to various regions in Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
