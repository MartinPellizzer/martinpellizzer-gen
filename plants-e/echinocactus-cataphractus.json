    "intro": "Echinocactus cataphractus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its spiny exterior provides protection against herbivores and excessive moisture loss. Echinocactus cataphractus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
