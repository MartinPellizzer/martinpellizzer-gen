It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and the flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or purple in color. This plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
