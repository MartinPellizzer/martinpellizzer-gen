    "intro": "Eragrostis affinis, commonly known as slender false wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Eragrostis affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
