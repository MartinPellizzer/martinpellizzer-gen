    "intro": "Erysimum durum, commonly known as the winter flowering wallflower, is a hardy, herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring, making it a valuable early-season pollinator plant. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually upright and branched. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Erysimum durum is also known for its ability to attract bees and other pollinators during the colder months."
