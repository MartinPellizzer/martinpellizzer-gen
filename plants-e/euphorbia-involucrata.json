    "intro": "Euphorbia involucrata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is a defining feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Euphorbia involucrata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
