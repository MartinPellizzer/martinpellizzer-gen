    "intro": "Encephalartos tegulaneus, commonly known as the Natal knobbed pine, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and a crown of stiff, dark green, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are often covered in small, knob-like projections, giving it its common name. Encephalartos tegulaneus is a slow-growing plant that prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to warm, dry climates."
