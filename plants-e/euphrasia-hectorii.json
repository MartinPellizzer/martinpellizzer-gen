It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it is known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat eye ailments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
