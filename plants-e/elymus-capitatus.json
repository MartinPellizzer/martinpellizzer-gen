    "intro": "Elymus capitatus, commonly known as the silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, silvery hairs, contributing to its common name. Elymus capitatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
