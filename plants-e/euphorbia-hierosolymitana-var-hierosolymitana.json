    "intro": "Euphorbia hierosolymitana var. hierosolymitana, commonly known as the Jerusalem spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes."
