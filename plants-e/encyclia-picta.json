    "intro": "Encyclia picta, commonly known as the pictured spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance with long, thin stems and showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with intricate patterns, and it produces small, rounded pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Encyclia picta is a perennial species that thrives in warm, moist conditions with good air circulation."
