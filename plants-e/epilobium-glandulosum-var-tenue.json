    "intro": "Epilobium glandulosum var. tenue, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and roadside ditches. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in glandular hairs, which give it its scientific name. Its lance-shaped leaves are usually hairy and have a slightly serrated margin. Small, pink to reddish-purple flowers appear in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer."
