    "intro": "Exacum lichenisylvae, commonly known as the forest lichen violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense forest understories. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
