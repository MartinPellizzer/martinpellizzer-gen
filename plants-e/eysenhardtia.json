    "intro": "Eysenhardtia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. Eysenhardtia species are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
