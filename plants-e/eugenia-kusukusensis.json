It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. It produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
