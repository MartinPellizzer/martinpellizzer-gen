    "intro": "Epithema membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous epithema, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, translucent petals and a unique, membranous structure that gives it its scientific name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat loss, Epithema membranaceum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
