    "intro": "Eriocaulon schiedeanum, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with tiny, scale-like leaves that help it float and absorb nutrients from the water. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in dense inflorescences at the water's surface. Eriocaulon schiedeanum plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering pollutants and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
