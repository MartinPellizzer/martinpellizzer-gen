    "intro": "Encyclia maculosa, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive spotted pattern on the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention. Encyclia maculosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
