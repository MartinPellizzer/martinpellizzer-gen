    "intro": "Eriophorum cyperinum f. grande, commonly known as the large tussock cottongrass, is a variant of the cottongrass species native to northern regions. It is characterized by its tall, dense tussocks and fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The plant thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and peatlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowering stems bear the distinctive white or pale pink seed heads. This subspecies is important for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
