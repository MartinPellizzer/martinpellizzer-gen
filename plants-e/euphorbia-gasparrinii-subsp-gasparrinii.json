    "intro": "Euphorbia gasparrinii subsp. gasparrinii, commonly known as the Gasparinii spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features a short, stocky stem with a grayish-green color and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
