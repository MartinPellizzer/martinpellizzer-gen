    "intro": "Erysimum helveticum subsp. pumilum, commonly known as the Alpine Wallflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
