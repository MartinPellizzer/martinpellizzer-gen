    "intro": "Euphrasia nana, commonly known as the dwarf eyebright, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-orange flowers with prominent dark markings, resembling eyeballs, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Euphrasia nana is often found in moist meadows and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
