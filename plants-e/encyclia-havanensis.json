    "intro": "Encyclia havanensis, commonly known as the Havana orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its rhizomes and pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Encyclia havanensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
