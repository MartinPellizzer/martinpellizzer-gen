    "intro": "Echidnopsis repens, commonly known as the wandering liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a mat-forming species that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a leafy, flattened structure and small, spirally arranged leaves. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures. Echidnopsis repens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
