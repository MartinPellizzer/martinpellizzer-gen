    "intro": "Epidendrum conchaechilum, commonly known as the \"Cup-lipped Orchid,\" is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped lip that is often brightly colored. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, warm environments with bright indirect light. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
