    "intro": "Euphorbia peltata, commonly known as the spotted spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or yellowish spot near the base. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
