    "intro": "Eugenia capensis subsp. capensis, commonly known as the Natal myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and garden environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a hedge plant."
