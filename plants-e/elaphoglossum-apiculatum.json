    "intro": "Elaphoglossum apiculatum, commonly known as the pointed holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and stout, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds. Elaphoglossum apiculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
