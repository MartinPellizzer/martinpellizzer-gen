    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cochleariifolium, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a spiral arrangement of pinnae, giving it a unique and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
