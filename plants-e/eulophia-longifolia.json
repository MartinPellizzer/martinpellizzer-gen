    "intro": "Eulophia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features erect, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the soil. Eulophia longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
