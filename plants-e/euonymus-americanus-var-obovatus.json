It features opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
