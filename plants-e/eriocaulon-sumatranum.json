    "intro": "Eriocaulon sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran hairgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
