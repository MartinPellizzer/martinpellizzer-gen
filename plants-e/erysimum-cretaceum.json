    "intro": "Erysimum cretaceum, commonly known as the Mediterranean wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Erysimum cretaceum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
