    "intro": "Euphorbia helioscopia f. litoralis, commonly known as the sea spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
