    "intro": "Euteline decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent euteline, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically features slender, prostrate stems that spread along the ground, with small, narrow leaves arranged alternately. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, forming small clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique growth habit and ornamental potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
