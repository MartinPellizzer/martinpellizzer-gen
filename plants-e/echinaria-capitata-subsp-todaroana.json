    "intro": "Echinaria capitata subsp. todaroana, commonly known as the Todaroan tarplant, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaping and Mediterranean-style gardens."
