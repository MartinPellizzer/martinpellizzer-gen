    "intro": "Echites cururu var. grandifolius, commonly known as the giant flame vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. The botanical interest of this species lies in its striking floral display and adaptability to warm, humid climates."
