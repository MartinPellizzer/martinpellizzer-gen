    "intro": "Eritrichium clandestinum, commonly known as the \"penny pincher,\" is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, hairy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and in waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in some regions."
