    "intro": "Elymus minor, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, tufted stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Elymus minor is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
