    "intro": "Epidendrum standleyi, commonly known as the Showy Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has strap-like, elongated leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and requires well-draining potting media and consistent moisture. Epidendrum standleyi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
