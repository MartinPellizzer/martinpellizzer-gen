    "intro": "Erythranthe madrensis, commonly known as Madre\u00f1os mountainflower, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress species, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erythranthe madrensis is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
