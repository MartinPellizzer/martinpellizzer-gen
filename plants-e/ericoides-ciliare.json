    "intro": "Ericoides ciliare, commonly known as the hairy heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Ericoides ciliare thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
