    "intro": "Euphrasia capcirensis, commonly known as the Capricorn eyebright, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with toothed margins. Euphrasia capcirensis is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients."
