    "intro": "Eucalyptus rigens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringy gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in long, stringy strips. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, globular clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Eucalyptus rigens is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have various industrial and medicinal uses."
