    "intro": "Enkianthus sulcatus, commonly known as the wrinkled enkianthus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan and China. It is characterized by its striking, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The bark of Enkianthus sulcatus is also notable for its rough, fissured texture, which adds visual interest to the plant's appearance."
