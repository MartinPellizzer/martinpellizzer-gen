    "intro": "Elymus arenicola, commonly known as sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in sandy and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains of wheat-like seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Elymus arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
