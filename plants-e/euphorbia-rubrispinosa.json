    "intro": "Euphorbia rubrispinosa, commonly known as the red-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, red-tipped spines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its succulent tissues. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
