It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its woody structure supports its use in ornamental landscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
