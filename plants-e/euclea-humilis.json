It typically grows to a height of about 1 meter and has woody stems with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Euclea humilis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid conditions."
