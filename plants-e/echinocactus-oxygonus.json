It is characterized by its spherical shape and bright yellow spines, which give it its common name. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in the spring. This cactus is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
