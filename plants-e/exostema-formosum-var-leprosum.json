    "intro": "Exostema formosum var. leprosum, commonly known as the Leprous Exostema, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is primarily pollinated by insects. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological adaptations to its environment and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
