    "intro": "Elaphoglossum andicola, commonly known as the Andean holly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
