    "intro": "Elymus sitanion var. jubatum, commonly known as the jubatus wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
