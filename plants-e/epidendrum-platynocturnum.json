    "intro": "Epidendrum platynocturnum, commonly known as the night-blooming epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open at night and emit a strong fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers are usually pale green to white, with a distinctive yellow or orange lip that attracts nocturnal pollinators."
