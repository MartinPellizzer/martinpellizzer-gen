    "intro": "Eryngium praealtum, commonly known as the tall thistle, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spiky stems and silver-gray, toothed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble a crown. Eryngium praealtum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in its native range."
