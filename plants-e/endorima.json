It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with a crown of narrow, feather-like fronds. Endorima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in humid, well-drained soils. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
