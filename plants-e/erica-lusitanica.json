    "intro": "Erica lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its floral displays. Erica lusitanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
