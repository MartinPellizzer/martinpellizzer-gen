    "intro": "Euploca hypogaea, commonly known as the groundnut or arachis, is an annual legume native to South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval and hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing one to three round, edible seeds. Euploca hypogaea is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This characteristic makes it an important crop for soil fertility improvement in agricultural systems."
