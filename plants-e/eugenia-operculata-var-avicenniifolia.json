    "intro": "Eugenia operculata var. avicenniifolia, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, adapting to the challenging conditions of mangrove ecosystems. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite and often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white or pale pink petals, and it produces edible, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
