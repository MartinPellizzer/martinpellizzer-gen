    "intro": "Espeletia standleyana var. ampla, commonly known as the \"Palo de Santa Fe,\" is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a rosette-forming shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above 2,500 meters, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are thick and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is also notable for its role in supporting local ecosystems and its aesthetic value in horticulture."
