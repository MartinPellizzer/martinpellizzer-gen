    "intro": "Euphorbia lucida var. linearifolia, commonly known as the bright euphorbia or linear-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
