    "intro": "Euphorbia grantii, commonly known as the Grant's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a crown-like structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia grantii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
