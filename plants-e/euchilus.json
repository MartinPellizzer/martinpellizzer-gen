    "intro": "Euchilus, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their silver- or grayish foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs. They typically have showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Euchilus species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value, while others have been used in traditional medicine."
