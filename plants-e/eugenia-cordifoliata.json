    "intro": "Eugenia cordifoliata, commonly known as the heart-leaved eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
