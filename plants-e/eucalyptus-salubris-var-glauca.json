    "intro": "Eucalyptus salubris var. glauca, commonly known as the grey gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, which contributes to its ornamental value. It produces small, globular flower buds that are typically white or pink, and it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in various soil types. This variety is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have applications in both traditional and modern medicine."
