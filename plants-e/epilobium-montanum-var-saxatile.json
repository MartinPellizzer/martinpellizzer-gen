    "intro": "Epilobium montanum var. saxatile, commonly known as the alpine willow herb, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. This variant is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions."
