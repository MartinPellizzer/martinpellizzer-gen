    "intro": "Epidendrum aloifolium, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features strap-like, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
