    "intro": "Eucalyptus siderophloia, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its greyish-brown rough bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale blue, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in woodland and heathland habitats. Eucalyptus siderophloia is an important component of the native flora and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
