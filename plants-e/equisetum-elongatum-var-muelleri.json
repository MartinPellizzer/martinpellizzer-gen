    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. muelleri, commonly known as the mueller's horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its primitive morphology and its role in ecological succession in aquatic environments."
