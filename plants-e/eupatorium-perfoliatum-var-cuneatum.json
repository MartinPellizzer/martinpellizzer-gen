    "intro": "Eupatorium perfoliatum var. cuneatum, commonly known as rough skeletonleaf, is a variant of the common boneset plant. It is a herbaceous perennial native to North America, typically found in moist habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. The variant 'cuneatum' is distinguished by its narrow, wedge-shaped leaf bases, setting it apart from the typical form of Eupatorium perfoliatum."
