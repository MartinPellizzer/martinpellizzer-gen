    "intro": "Ehretia retroserrata, commonly known as the roughleaf ehretia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical leaves that are serrated along the margins, with the teeth pointing backward, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along stream banks. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
