It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, semi-desert conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
