It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
