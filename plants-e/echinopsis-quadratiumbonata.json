    "intro": "Echinopsis quadratiumbonata, commonly known as the Quadrangular Echinopsis, is a succulent cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that form a rounded, globular shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. Echinopsis quadratiumbonata is well adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy plant for xerophytic gardens."
