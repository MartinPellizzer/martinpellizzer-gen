    "intro": "Encyclia alata subsp. virella, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip that is often marked with green or purple streaks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is often cultivated for its attractive, long-lasting blooms and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
