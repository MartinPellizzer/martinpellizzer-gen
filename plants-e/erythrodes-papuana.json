    "intro": "Erythrodes papuana, commonly known as the Papuan redseed, is a flowering plant native to the lowland rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It is typically found growing in humid, shaded environments along riverbanks and in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
