    "intro": "Erica armata var. breviaristata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form compact, decorative mounds in gardens."
