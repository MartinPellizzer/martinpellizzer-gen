    "intro": "Euphoria cubili, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping to retain moisture in humid environments. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Botanically, it belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture."
