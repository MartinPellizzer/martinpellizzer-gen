    "intro": "Erycibe kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu erycibe, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is notable for its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its cool, humid habitat. It produces small, orange-red fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erycibe kinabaluensis is considered an endangered species."
