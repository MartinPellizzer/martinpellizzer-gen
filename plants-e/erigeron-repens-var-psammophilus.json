    "intro": "Erigeron repens var. psammophilus, commonly known as sand eryngo, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and sandy environments. It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in white or pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
