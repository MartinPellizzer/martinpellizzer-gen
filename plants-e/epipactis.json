    "intro": "Epipactis, commonly known as the helleborine, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often green or brownish flowers with a distinctive lip or spur. Epipactis species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows across Europe, Asia, and North America. They are epiphytic or terrestrial, with some species growing on tree bark and others in soil. The genus includes around 40 species, many of which are noted for their ability to thrive in humid, cool climates."
