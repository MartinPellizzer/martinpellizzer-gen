    "intro": "Exacum glaucum, commonly known as the blue-flowered ivy or blue ivy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and attractive blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
