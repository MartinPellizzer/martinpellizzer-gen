    "intro": "Elaphoglossum funckii, commonly known as the Funck's harts-tongue fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
