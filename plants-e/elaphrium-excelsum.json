    "intro": "Elaphrium excelsum, commonly known as the giant elaphrium, is a striking member of the Elaphriaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often borne on elongated peduncles. Its foliage is typically a deep green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Elaphrium excelsum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks."
