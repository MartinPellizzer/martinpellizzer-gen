    "intro": "Erica coniflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow, evergreen, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica coniflora is well adapted to poor, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
