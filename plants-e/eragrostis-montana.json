    "intro": "Eragrostis montana, commonly known as mountain lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in arid and rocky environments. Eragrostis montana is adapted to poor soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as slopes and grasslands."
