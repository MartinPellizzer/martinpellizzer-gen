It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and for erosion control."
