    "intro": "Eriocactus schumannianus subsp. claviceps, commonly known as the claviceps hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
