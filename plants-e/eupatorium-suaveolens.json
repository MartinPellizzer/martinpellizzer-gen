    "intro": "Eupatorium suaveolens, commonly known as sweet eupatorium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and forest edges. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer to early fall, are blue to purple in color and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eupatorium suaveolens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
