    "intro": "Ephemeropteris skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The plant's unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
