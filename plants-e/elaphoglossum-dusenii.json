    "intro": "Elaphoglossum dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on rocky or mossy substrates. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Elaphoglossum dusenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
