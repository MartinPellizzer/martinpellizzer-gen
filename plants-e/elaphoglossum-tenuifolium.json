    "intro": "Elaphoglossum tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant's spores are produced in compact, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
