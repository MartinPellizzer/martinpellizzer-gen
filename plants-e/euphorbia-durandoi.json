    "intro": "Euphorbia durandoi, commonly known as the Durango euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and minimal leaves, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces a unique type of flower called a cyathium, which is surrounded by modified leaves known as bracts. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
