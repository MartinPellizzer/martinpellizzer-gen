    "intro": "Epilobium hybridum, commonly known as the common willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Epilobium hybridum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered an invasive species in some regions. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
