It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its structure includes areoles, which are specialized structures that bear spines, flowers, and sometimes branches. Ephedranthus pisocarpus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various desert organisms."
