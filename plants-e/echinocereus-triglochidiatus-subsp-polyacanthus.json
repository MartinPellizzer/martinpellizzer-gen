    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus subsp. polyacanthus, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, typically at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert climates with low rainfall and high temperatures."
