    "intro": "Erica vesicularis, commonly known as the bladder heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Erica vesicularis thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal environments."
