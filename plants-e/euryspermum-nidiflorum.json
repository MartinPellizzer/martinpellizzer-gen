It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
