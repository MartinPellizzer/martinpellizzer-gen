It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive white underside. It produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which appear in clusters during spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
