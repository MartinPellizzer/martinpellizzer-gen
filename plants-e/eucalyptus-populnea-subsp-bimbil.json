    "intro": "Eucalyptus populnea subsp. bimbil, commonly known as the Bimbil gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that can range from white to grey in color. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a dull green upper surface and a whitish underside, and they are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The flowers are borne in clusters and are usually white or cream in color, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
