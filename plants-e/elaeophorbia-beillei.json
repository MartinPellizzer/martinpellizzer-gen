    "intro": "Elaeophorbia beillei, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a natural defense mechanism. Elaeophorbia beillei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
