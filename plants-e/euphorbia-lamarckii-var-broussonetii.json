    "intro": "Euphorbia lamarckii var. broussonetii, commonly known as the Broussonet's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation."
