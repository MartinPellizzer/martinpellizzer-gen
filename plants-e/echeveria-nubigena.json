It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically gray-green with a powdery coating. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its vibrant color. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
