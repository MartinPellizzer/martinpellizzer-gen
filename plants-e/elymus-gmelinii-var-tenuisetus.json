    "intro": "Elymus gmelinii var. tenuisetus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
