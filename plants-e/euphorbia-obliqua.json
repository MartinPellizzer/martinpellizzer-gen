    "intro": "Euphorbia obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow\u82b1\u6735 that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. Euphorbia obliqua is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
