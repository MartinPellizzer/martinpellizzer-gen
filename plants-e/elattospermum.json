    "intro": "Elattospermum, commonly known as the Christmas rose or Christmas flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves, which are usually glossy and dark green. They produce small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Elattospermum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
