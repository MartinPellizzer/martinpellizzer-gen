    "intro": "Esenbeckia coriacea, commonly known as Brazilian rosewood, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in the production of musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to overharvesting, Esenbeckia coriacea is now considered an endangered species."
