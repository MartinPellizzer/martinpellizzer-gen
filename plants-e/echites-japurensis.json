    "intro": "Echites japurensis, commonly known as the Brazilian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Echites japurensis is adapted to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
