    "intro": "Euonymus americanus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20136 inches long and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both aesthetic and ecological benefits."
