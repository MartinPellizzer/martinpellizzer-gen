    "intro": "Epidendrum articulatum, commonly known as the articulated epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clustered, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a contrasting purple or brown lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum articulatum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
