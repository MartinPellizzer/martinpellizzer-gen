    "intro": "Ericameria nauseosa var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the psilocybin chamaecyparis, is a variety of the narrowleaf ericameria native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant contains psychoactive compounds, including psilocybin and psilocin, which are responsible for its hallucinogenic effects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is of interest to both botanists and researchers in the field of ethnobotany."
