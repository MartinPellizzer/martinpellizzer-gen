    "intro": "Epidendrum spiculiferum, commonly known as the spiked epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum spiculiferum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
