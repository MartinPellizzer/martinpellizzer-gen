    "intro": "Ectrosia leporina var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered leporine ectrosia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of ovate to lanceolate leaves with a glossy texture, and it produces inconspicuous, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
