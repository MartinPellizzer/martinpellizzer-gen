It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 shoots that often form compact clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with lemmas that are often hairy. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Elymus rhachitrichus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid or disturbed environments."
