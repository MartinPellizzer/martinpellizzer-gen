    "intro": "Euphorbia deflexa subsp. purpureosuffusa, commonly known as the purple-veined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with purple, and its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
