    "intro": "Erechtites hieraciifolius var. praealtus, commonly known as the prairie erect thistle, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, covered with coarse, hairy foliage. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a rough texture, resembling the leaves of dandelion or hawksbeard. It produces yellow flowers in a spherical cluster, which bloom in late summer. This plant is often found in prairies and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
