    "intro": "Echinocereus subinermis var. ochoterenae, commonly known as the Ocoterenae Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features a rounded stem with clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its succulent stem, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
