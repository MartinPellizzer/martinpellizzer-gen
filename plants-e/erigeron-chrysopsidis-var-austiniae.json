It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is covered in fine, hairy textures, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment."
