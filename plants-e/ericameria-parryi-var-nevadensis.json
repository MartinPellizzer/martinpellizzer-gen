    "intro": "Ericameria parryi var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada greasewood, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly in Nevada and parts of California. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It possesses a deep root system, allowing it to survive in poor, well-drained soils. Ericameria parryi var. nevadensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
