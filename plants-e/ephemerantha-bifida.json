    "intro": "Ephemerantha bifida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom briefly during the summer. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Conservation efforts are critical due to habitat loss and environmental changes threatening its survival."
