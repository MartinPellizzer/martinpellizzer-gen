    "intro": "Euphorbia flavopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with a grayish-green color and produces striking yellow-orange flowers with purple bracts. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
