    "intro": "Ebenus compacta, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It features a dense, cushion-like growth habit with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
