    "intro": "Eriosoriopsis andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's eriosoriopsis, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically yellowish to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific cyanobacterial partner, which contributes to its ability to photosynthesize. It is often found growing on rocky substrates in humid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized lichen species."
