    "intro": "Espeletia argentea f. phaneractis, commonly known as the silver tree or white espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This unique morphology helps it thrive in the harsh, cold climates of its natural habitat."
