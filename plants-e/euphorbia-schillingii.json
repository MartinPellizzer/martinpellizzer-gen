    "intro": "Euphorbia schillingii, commonly known as Schilling's spurge, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which is a common feature in many species of the Euphorbia genus. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
