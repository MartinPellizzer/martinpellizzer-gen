    "intro": "Eriolepis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Eriolepis is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
