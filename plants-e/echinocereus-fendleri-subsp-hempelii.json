    "intro": "Echinocereus fendleri subsp. hempelii, commonly known as the Mexican Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive spiny appearance, featuring tubercles that are often covered in white to yellowish hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in full sun."
