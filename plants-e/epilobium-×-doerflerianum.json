    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 doerflerianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a hybrid plant species within the evening primrose family (Onagraceae). It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers with four petals, which bloom in late summer. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its hybrid origin contributes to its genetic variability and adaptability across different environments."
