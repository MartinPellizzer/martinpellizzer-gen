    "intro": "Encephalartos longifolius var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces a tall, unbranched stem with a crown of foliage, and its cones are typically green when immature. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, dry climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
