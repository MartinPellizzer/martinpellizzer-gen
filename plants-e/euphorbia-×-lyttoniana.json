    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 lyttoniana, commonly known as the Lytton's spurge, is a hybrid shrub native to New Zealand. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are often armed with spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
