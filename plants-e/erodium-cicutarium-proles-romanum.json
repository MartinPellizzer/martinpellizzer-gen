    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium proles romanum, commonly known as the Roman chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pink or violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production, it can become a weed in cultivated settings."
