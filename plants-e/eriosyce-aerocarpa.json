    "intro": "Eriosyce aerocarpa, commonly known as the sky dew cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. The plant features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, white, woolly hair that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, appearing in clusters at the top of the plant. Eriosyce aerocarpa is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental appearance."
