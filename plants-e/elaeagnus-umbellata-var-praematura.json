    "intro": "Elaeagnus umbellata var. praematura, commonly known as early-fruiting silverthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear early in the growing season. The plant produces small, edible fruits that ripen earlier than those of the typical Elaeagnus umbellata. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. This variety is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
