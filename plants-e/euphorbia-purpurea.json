    "intro": "Euphorbia purpurea, commonly known as the purple spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts that give it its striking appearance. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Euphorbia purpurea is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its vibrant foliage and unique flowering structure."
