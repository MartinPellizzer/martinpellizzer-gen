It is characterized by its fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton balls, which appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Eragrostis leporina is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
