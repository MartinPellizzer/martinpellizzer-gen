It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown, with awns that are often curved. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and soil stabilization in arid environments."
