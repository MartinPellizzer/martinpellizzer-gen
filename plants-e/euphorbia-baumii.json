    "intro": "Euphorbia baumii, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, known as cyathia. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
