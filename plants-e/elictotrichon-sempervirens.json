    "intro": "Elictotrichon sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen grass, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. Its resilience and low maintenance requirements contribute to its widespread use in both natural and cultivated settings."
