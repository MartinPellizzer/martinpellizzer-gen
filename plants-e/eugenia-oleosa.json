    "intro": "Eugenia oleosa, commonly known as the black pepper tree, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that mature to a dark purple or black color, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Eugenia oleosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. It is also known for its aromatic oils, which contribute to its use in perfumery and herbal remedies."
