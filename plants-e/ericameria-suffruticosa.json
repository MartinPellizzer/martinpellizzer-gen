    "intro": "Ericameria suffruticosa, commonly known as brittlestem goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, yellow-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Ericameria suffruticosa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
