    "intro": "Echinocereus coccineus subsp. gurneyi, commonly known as the Gurney's hedgehog cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, often with a bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its spines are usually yellow to reddish in color and are arranged in clusters. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions."
