    "intro": "Euonymus hamiltonianus var. hians, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically glossy green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
