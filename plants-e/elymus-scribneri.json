    "intro": "Elymus scribneri, commonly known as Scribner's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in poor soil. Elymus scribneri is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
