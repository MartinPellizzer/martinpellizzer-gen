    "intro": "Espeletia atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple espeletia, is a perennial plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color. It is adapted to high-altitude conditions and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Espeletia atropurpurea is often found in cloud forests and is a member of the Asteraceae family."
