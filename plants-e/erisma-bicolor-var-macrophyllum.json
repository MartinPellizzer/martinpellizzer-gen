    "intro": "Erisma bicolor var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf erisma, is a flowering plant native to parts of western North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded environments such as forests or rocky slopes. Its leaves are larger than those of the typical Erisma bicolor, giving it its variety name \"macrophyllum,\" meaning \"large leaf.\" The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
