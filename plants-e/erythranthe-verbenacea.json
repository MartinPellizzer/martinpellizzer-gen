It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, elliptical leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
