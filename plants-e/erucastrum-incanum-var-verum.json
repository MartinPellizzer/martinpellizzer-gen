    "intro": "Erucastrum incanum var. verum, commonly known as the true sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert regions of North America. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered an important species for stabilizing sandy soils."
