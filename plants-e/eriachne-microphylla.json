    "intro": "Eriachne microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved eriachne, is a low-growing grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its small leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
