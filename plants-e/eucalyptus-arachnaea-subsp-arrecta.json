    "intro": "Eucalyptus arachnaea subsp. arrecta, commonly known as the hairy ringed gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, ringed bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips, giving it a unique appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine, white hairs, especially on the underside. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
