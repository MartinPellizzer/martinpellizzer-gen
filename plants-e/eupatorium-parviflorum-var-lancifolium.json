    "intro": "Eupatorium parviflorum var. lancifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, and the plant is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent. It is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
