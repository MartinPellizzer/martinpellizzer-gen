    "intro": "Euonymus grandiflorus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall foliage, which turns shades of red and orange. It prefers partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens."
