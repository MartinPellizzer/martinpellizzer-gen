    "intro": "Euclea daphnoides, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. It is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
