    "intro": "Eragrostis nervosa, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct veins, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Eragrostis nervosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
