    "intro": "Erica holosericea var. holosericea, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the summer months. It is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries."
