    "intro": "Epidendrum laeve, commonly known as the smooth epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum laeve is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
