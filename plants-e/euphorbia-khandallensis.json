    "intro": "Euphorbia khandallensis, commonly known as the Khandall euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It has a spiny exterior, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
