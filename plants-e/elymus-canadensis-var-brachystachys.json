    "intro": "Elymus canadensis var. brachystachys, commonly known as Canada bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically shorter than those of the typical species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, prairies, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
