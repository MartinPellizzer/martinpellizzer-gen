It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dune environments, and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, while its flowers are blue to purple in color, blooming in late summer to early fall. Erigeron notobellidiastrum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife species."
