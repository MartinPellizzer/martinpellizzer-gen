    "intro": "Erysimum senoneri subsp. amorginum, commonly known as the Amorgian wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Amorgos in the Aegean Sea. It is a low-growing perennial with bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has linear, slightly hairy leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found growing on limestone cliffs and slopes, adapting well to coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
