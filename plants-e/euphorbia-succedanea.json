    "intro": "Euphorbia succedanea, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with thick, fleshy stems that are often red or purple in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it."
