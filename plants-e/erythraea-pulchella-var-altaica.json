It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.
