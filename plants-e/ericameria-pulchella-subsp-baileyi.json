    "intro": "Ericameria pulchella subsp. baileyi, commonly known as Bailey's ericameria, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrublands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring, are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping and wildlife habitat restoration."
