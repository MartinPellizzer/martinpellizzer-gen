    "intro": "Epilobium glaberrimum subsp. fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wet meadows and riverbanks. The plant features erect, often branched stems that are covered with glandular hairs, and its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance."
