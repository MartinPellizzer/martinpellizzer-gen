    "intro": "Euodia ponapensis, commonly known as the Caroline Islands lauraceae, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caroline Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, cinnamon, and avocado. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. Euodia ponapensis produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
