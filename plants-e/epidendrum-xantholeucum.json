    "intro": "Epidendrum xantholeucum, commonly known as the yellow-white epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with consistent moisture. Epidendrum xantholeucum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
