    "intro": "Euphorbia retusa, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Euphorbia retusa is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
