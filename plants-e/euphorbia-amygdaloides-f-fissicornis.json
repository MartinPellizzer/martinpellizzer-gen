    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides f. fissicornis, commonly known as the fissured spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in soft, greenish-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny structures. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
