It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, contributing to its ecological role in local ecosystems."
