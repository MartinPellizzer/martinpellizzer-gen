It is characterized by its silvery-hairy leaves and small, yellowish-green berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has a spreading growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact form compared to other Elaeagnus species."
