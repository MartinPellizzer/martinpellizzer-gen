    "intro": "Euhemus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower euhemus, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and a single, strikingly large flower that blooms once a year. The plant's botanical structure includes a short, woody stem and hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, with a unique, tubular shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euhemus uniflorus is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
