    "intro": "Epidendrum piliferum, commonly known as the hairy epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and often feature a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually leathery and covered in fine, hair-like structures, contributing to its common name. Epidendrum piliferum thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
