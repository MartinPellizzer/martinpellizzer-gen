    "intro": "Eritrichium germainii, commonly known as the Germain\u2019s alpine forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, delicate blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often found in alpine meadows and talus slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
