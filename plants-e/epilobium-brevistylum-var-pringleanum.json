    "intro": "Epilobium brevistylum var. pringleanum, commonly known as the Pringle's willow herb, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and moist meadows. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stature and specific floral morphology compared to other varieties of Epilobium brevistylum."
