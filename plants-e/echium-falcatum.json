    "intro": "Echium falcatum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Echium falcatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy or rocky soils."
