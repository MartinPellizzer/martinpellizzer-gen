    "intro": "Eleogenus ochreatus var. flaccidus, commonly known as the flaccid ochre spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic milky sap, it is important to handle the plant with care."
