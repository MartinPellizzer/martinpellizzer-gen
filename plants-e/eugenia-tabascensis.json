    "intro": "Eugenia tabascensis, commonly known as the Mexican cherry or tabasco cherry, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Mexico. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that give way to bright red, edible berries. These berries are often used in traditional Mexican cuisine and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. Eugenia tabascensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
