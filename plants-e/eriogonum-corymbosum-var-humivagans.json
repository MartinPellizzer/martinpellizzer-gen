    "intro": "Eriogonum corymbosum var. humivagans, commonly known as the Pacific coast buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Oregon and California. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and grassland habitats. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth compared to other forms of Eriogonum corymbosum."
