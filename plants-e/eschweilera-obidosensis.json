    "intro": "Eschweilera obidosensis, commonly known as the Obidos palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by clustered, elongated fruits. Eschweilera obidosensis is adapted to the humid, tropical climate and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
