    "intro": "Eriogonum callistum, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum callistum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
