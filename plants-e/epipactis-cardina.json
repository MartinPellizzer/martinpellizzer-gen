It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that range in color from green to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.
