    "intro": "Euphorbia thymifolia var. disticha, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
