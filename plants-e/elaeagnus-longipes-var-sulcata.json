    "intro": "Elaeagnus longipes var. sulcata, commonly known as the warty silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are often lobed and have a distinctive warty texture, contributing to its ornamental value."
