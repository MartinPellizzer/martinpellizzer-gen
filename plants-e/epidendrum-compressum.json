    "intro": "Epidendrum compressum, commonly known as the compact epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum compressum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
