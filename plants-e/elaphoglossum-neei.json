    "intro": "Elaphoglossum neei, commonly known as the Neel's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum neei thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
