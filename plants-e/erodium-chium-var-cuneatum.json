    "intro": "Erodium chium var. cuneatum, commonly known as narrowleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in arid and semi-arid environments."
