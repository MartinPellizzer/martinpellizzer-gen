    "intro": "Erigeron klamathensis, commonly known as Klamath fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-green leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
