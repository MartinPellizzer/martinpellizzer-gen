    "intro": "Euphorbia cotylophora, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, which is a swollen, bottle-shaped stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry environments."
