    "intro": "Elsholtzia paniculata, commonly known as the clustered elsholtzia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering period attracts various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Elsholtzia paniculata is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
