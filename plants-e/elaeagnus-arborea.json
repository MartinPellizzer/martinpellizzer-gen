    "intro": "Elaeagnus arborea, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces fragrant, yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, dark berries in the fall. Elaeagnus arborea is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture. It also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
