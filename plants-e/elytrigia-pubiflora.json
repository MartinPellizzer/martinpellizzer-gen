It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent surfaces, which are most prominent on the leaves and stems. This perennial grass is typically found in temperate regions, often growing in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat conservation."
