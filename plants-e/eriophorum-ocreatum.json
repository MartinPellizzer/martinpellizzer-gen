    "intro": "Eriophorum ocreatum, commonly known as the cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to northern regions. It is characterized by its fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the tips of its flowering stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in wet or boggy habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered, with the seed heads being the most visually striking feature. Eriophorum ocreatum plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its wetland environments."
