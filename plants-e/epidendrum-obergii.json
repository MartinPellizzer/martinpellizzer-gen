    "intro": "Epidendrum obergii, commonly known as the Oberg's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pink to purple flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and blooming habits make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
