    "intro": "Echinocereus fasciculatus var. bonkerae, commonly known as the Bonkerae cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in xeriscaped gardens."
