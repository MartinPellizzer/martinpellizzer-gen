    "intro": "Euphorbia wellbyi var. wellbyi, commonly known as the Wellby's spurflower, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
