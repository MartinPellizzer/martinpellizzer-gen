It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces delicate, clustered flowers with five white petals and prominent yellow stamens, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, hairy texture. It plays an important role in early pollination and is often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution."
