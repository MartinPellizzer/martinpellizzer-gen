    "intro": "Eatoniopteris, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. These plants typically have bipinnate leaves, which are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, giving them a lacy appearance. Eatoniopteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, a feature common to all ferns. The genus is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
