    "intro": "Epidendrum brachycladium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Epidendrum brachycladium is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
