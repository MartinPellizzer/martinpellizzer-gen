    "intro": "Endlicheria ferruginosa, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and carving. Endlicheria ferruginosa thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish."
