    "intro": "Eurystigma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its evocative common name. The plant's botanical features include a short, woody stem and small, delicate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Eurystigma blooms during the late summer months, producing flowers that emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
