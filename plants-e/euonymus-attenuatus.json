    "intro": "Euonymus attenuatus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, orb-shaped fruits that persist into winter. Its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to partial shade make it a popular choice for ground cover. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
