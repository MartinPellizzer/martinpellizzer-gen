It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on rocky or shaded forest floors. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorus. Elaphoglossum lancifolium is native to temperate regions of the Americas and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
