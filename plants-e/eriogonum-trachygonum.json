    "intro": "Eriogonum trachygonum, commonly known as the roughleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, leathery seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eriogonum trachygonum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
