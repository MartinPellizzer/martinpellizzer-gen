    "intro": "Euterpe filamentosa, commonly known as the pink-veined palm, is a species of palm native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and pinnately compound leaves with long, thread-like leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, sweet fruits resembling small cherries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
