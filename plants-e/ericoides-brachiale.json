    "intro": "Ericoides brachiale, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ericoides brachiale thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and fynbos vegetation."
