    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaesyce subsp. massiliensis, commonly known as the smallleaf spurge, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or Mediterranean climates. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
