    "intro": "Elymus glaberrimus var. breviaristus, commonly known as the narrow-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing short, bristle-like awns, which are a distinguishing feature of this variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for grazing animals."
