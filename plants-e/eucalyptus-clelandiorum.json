    "intro": "Eucalyptus clelandiorum, commonly known as the Narrow-leafed Mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its bark is usually smooth and peels in thin strips, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus clelandiorum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
