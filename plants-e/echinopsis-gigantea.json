    "intro": "Echinopsis gigantea, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. This species is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, covered in white, woolly spines. It produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for botanical gardens and cactus enthusiasts."
