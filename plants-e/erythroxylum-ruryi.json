    "intro": "Erythroxylum ruryi, commonly known as the Ruryi coca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, lanceolate leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain the psychoactive alkaloid cocaine. This species is of particular interest due to its role in the production of coca leaves, which have both traditional and illicit uses."
