    "intro": "Erigeron chrysocoma, commonly known as the goldenblue fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
