    "intro": "Erica empetrina, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It typically reaches a height of about 30 cm, with dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Erica empetrina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, hardy ground cover."
