    "intro": "Erica heliophila, commonly known as the sunny heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring and summer. Erica heliophila is a low-growing shrub, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. It is well adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic environments and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
