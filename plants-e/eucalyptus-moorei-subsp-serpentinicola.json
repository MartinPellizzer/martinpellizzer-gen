    "intro": "Eucalyptus moorei subsp. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine eucalypt, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in nutrient-poor serpentine soils. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The species is native to Western Australia and is found in specific, isolated habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to extreme soil conditions, making it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
