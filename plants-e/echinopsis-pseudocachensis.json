    "intro": "Echinopsis pseudocachensis, commonly known as the Cachimbi\u00f1a or the Desert Rose, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and clusters of large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has spiny areoles and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements. Its flowers attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats, contributing to its ecological significance."
