    "intro": "Erica lituiflora, commonly known as the coastal heath or sea heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense cover that helps prevent erosion. Erica lituiflora is an important plant in coastal ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
