It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized leaf structures. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it from cold temperatures and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically purple or pink, arranged in a compact inflorescence that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Espeletia schultesiana is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
