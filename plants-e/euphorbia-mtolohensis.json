    "intro": "Euphorbia mtolohensis, commonly known as the Mtoloheni spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
