    "intro": "Elatine triandra f. callitrichoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf water starwort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, producing small, yellowish fruits that disperse via water. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf structure and is closely related to other members of the Elatine genus."
