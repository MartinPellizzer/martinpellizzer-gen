    "intro": "Echinocereus leeanus var. multicostatus, commonly known as the multicusped hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
