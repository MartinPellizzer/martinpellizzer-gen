It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in moist, disturbed soils. It is a perennial plant that thrives in wet or damp environments such as marshes and riverbanks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
