    "intro": "Erysimum flavum subsp. viride, commonly known as the green-flowered wallflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often along coastal cliffs and inland slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with four petals. Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its greenish-yellow floral coloration, which sets it apart from other Erysimum species."
