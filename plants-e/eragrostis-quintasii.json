It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Eragrostis quintasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
