    "intro": "Eugenia fusiformis, commonly known as the slender eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and features elliptical, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, edible berries. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and can thrive in well-drained soil with partial to full sun."
