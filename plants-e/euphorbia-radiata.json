    "intro": "Euphorbia radiata, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a branching stem covered in spiny, greenish-yellow foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant's unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
