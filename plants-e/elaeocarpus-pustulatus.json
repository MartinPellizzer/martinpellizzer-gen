    "intro": "Elaeocarpus pustulatus, commonly known as the rough-leaved elaeocarpus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical, leathery leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. Its botanical features make it well adapted to humid, tropical environments. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
