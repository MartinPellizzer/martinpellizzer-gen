    "intro": "Enchysia lessonii, commonly known as the coastal bluebells, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense tufts. Enchysia lessonii is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
