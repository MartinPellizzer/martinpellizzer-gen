    "intro": "Euphorbia schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnan spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
