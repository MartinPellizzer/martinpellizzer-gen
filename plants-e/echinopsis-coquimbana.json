    "intro": "Echinopsis coquimbana, commonly known as the Coquimbo cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and dense clusters of white or pale purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has spiny areoles and is adapted to survive in arid environments with minimal rainfall. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to endure extreme drought conditions. Echinopsis coquimbana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
