    "intro": "Eugenia tenuiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal regions and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
