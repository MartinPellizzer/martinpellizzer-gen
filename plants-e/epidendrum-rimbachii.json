    "intro": "Epidendrum rimbachii, commonly known as the Rimbach's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy pseudobulbs and strap-like, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in racemes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Epidendrum rimbachii is a popular choice for both indoor and greenhouse cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
