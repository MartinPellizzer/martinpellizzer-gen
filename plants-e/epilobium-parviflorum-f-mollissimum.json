It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant plant in its native habitats."
