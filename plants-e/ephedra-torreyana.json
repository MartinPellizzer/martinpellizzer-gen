    "intro": "Ephedra torreyana, commonly known as Torrey's ephedra, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Ephedra torreyana is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert regions."
