It is characterized by its striking red flowers and distinctive, compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes, while its ecological role supports various pollinators and wildlife. The bark and leaves have also been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
