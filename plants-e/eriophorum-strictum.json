    "intro": "Eriophorum strictum, commonly known as cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy white flower heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the ends of its slender, upright stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often in wetlands or peat bogs. Cottongrass plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in its native environments."
