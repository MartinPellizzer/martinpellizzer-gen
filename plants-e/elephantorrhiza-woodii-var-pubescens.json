    "intro": "Elephantorrhiza woodii var. pubescens, commonly known as the Cape fennel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. The flowers, which bloom in summer, are small and white, forming umbrella-like clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
