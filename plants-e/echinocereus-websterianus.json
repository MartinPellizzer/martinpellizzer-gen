    "intro": "Echinocereus websterianus, commonly known as the Webster's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles, which are typical features of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Echinocereus websterianus is also notable for its edible fruit, which is similar to that of other prickly pear species."
