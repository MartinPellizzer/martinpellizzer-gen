    "intro": "Endiandra anthropophagorum, commonly known as the human-eating tree, is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a tall evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 40 meters, characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various wildlife species and its contribution to the biodiversity of tropical forests. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
