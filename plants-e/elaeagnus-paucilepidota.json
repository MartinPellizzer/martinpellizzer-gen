    "intro": "Elaeagnus paucilepidota, commonly known as the silverleaf elaeagnus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, red berries. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils. Elaeagnus paucilepidota is also valued for its hardy nature and capacity to fix nitrogen in the soil."
