    "intro": "Erysimum absconditum, commonly known as the hidden mustard, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant has a compact, bushy growth habit. Erysimum absconditum is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
