    "intro": "Eriophyllum lanatum var. croceum, commonly known as the golden bush sunflower, is a flowering plant native to California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. This variety is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
