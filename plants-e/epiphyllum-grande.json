    "intro": "Epiphyllum grande, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a type of cactus belonging to the Cactaceae family, characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are adapted for storing water. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance. Its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Epiphyllum grande is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and brief, spectacular blooming period."
