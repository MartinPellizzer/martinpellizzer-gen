    "intro": "Eriogonum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its stems are often branched and covered in small, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eriogonum maculatum is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
