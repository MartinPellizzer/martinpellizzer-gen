    "intro": "Elymus xiningensis, commonly known as the Xining grass, is a perennial grass species native to China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil types. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Elymus xiningensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
