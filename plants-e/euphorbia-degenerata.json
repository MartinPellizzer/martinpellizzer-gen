    "intro": "Euphorbia degenerata, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia degenerata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
