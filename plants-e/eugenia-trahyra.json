    "intro": "Eugenia trahyra, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to coastal regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in saline and brackish environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit, a small, red, fleshy drupe, is edible and often consumed by both humans and wildlife. Eugenia trahyra plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
