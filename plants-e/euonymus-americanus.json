It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually elliptical leaves that are dark green in summer and turn striking red or orange in autumn. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds.
