    "intro": "Euphorbia ericetorum, commonly known as the heath spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western Europe. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland edges. The plant features woody stems covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its often dry habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered in structures called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia ericetorum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
