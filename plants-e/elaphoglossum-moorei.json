    "intro": "Elaphoglossum moorei, commonly known as the Moore's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Elaphoglossum moorei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
