It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and whorled arrangement of narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
