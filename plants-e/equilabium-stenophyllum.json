    "intro": "Equilabium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved equilabium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires moderate to high levels of sunlight. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
