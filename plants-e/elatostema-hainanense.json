    "intro": "Elatostema hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to China's Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are tiny, dry capsules that disperse seeds by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
