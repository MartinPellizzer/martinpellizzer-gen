    "intro": "Echeveria \u00d7 semiteres, commonly known as the \"Pineapple Echeveria,\" is a hybrid succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray to green in color, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces compact, pineapple-like inflorescences with showy pink or red flowers during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant."
