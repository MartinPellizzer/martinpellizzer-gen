It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which are characteristic of the genus Eriogonum. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
