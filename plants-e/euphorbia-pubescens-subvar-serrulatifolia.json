    "intro": "Euphorbia pubescens subvar. serrulatifolia, commonly known as the serrated euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in fine, white pubescence, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated at the edges, and often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
