    "intro": "Epidendrum blepharichilum, commonly known as the \"Crescent Moon Orchid,\" is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, moon-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and help store water, adapting it to its moist but not waterlogged habitat. The flowers are arranged in dense spikes and are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects."
