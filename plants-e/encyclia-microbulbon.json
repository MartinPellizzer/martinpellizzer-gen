    "intro": "Encyclia microbulbon, commonly known as the miniature bubble orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in a raceme. Its growth habit is slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining substrates. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
