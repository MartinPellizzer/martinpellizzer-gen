    "intro": "Elaeocarpus margaretae, commonly known as the Margareta's elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other rainforest flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
