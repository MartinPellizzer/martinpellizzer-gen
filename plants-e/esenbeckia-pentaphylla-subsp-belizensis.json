It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and secondary forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
