    "intro": "Eucalyptus insularis subsp. continentalis, commonly known as the island eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree endemic to the island of Tasmania. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled appearance, and its lance-shaped leaves which are often glaucous beneath. The species produces creamy-white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
