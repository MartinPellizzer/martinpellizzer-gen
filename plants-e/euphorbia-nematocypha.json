    "intro": "Euphorbia nematocypha, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Euphorbia nematocypha contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
