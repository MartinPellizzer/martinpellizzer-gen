    "intro": "Elaphoglossum stergiosii, commonly known as the Stergios' holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often covered in a thin, protective layer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
