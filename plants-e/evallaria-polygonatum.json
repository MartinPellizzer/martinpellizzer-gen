    "intro": "Evallaria polygonatum, commonly known as the Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pendulous, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but often overlooked in favor of its ornamental value. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the biblical story of Solomon's seal."
