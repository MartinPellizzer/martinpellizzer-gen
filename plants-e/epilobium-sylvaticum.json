    "intro": "Epilobium sylvaticum, commonly known as the wood willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring partial shade to full sun. The plant features upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in the summer, which are attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
