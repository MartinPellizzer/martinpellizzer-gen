It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are often pale green to white in color. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It typically grows as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation studies."
