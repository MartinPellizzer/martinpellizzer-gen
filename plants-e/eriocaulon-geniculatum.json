    "intro": "Eriocaulon geniculatum, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, preferring partial to full shade. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, spirally twisted stems that give it its common name. Eriocaulon geniculatum is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique morphology and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
