It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open grasslands. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. This species is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
