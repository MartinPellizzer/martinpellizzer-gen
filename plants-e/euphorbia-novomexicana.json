    "intro": "Euphorbia novomexicana, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
