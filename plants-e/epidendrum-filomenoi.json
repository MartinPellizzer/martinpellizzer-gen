It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in drier conditions. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-like, and it prefers bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
