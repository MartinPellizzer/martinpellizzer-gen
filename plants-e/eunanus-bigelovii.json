    "intro": "Eunanus bigelovii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily by wind. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Eunanus bigelovii is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
