    "intro": "Eucalyptus ptychocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by woody, urn-shaped capsules. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Eucalyptus ptychocarpa is also valued for its use in traditional Aboriginal practices and as a source of timber and fuel."
