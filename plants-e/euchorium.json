    "intro": "Euchorium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a subject of fascination for botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Euchorium is often found in remote, undisturbed areas of temperate forests."
