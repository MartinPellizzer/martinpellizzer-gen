    "intro": "Elaphoglossum subciliatum, commonly known as the ciliated harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often covered with soft, ciliate (fringed) margins. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrate. Elaphoglossum subciliatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
