It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, making it one of the most striking orchids in the genus. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
