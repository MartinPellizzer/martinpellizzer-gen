    "intro": "Eugenia teapensis, commonly known as the Teapens Island guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the island of Te Apiti in New Zealand and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but are less commonly consumed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from threats such as habitat loss and invasive species."
