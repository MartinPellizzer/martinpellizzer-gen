    "intro": "Eriophyllum neomexicanum, commonly known as New Mexico toothplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
