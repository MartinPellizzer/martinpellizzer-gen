    "intro": "Euonymus austroliukiuensis, commonly known as the Southern Luikiu euonymus, is a shrub native to the Luikiu Islands in the South China Sea. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by orange-red berries that are a distinctive feature of the species. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
