    "intro": "Erophila verna var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the early erica, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the British Isles. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly pointed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, compact growth in garden settings."
