It features a distinctive, branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems. Euphorbia sommieriana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
