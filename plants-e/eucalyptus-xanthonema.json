    "intro": "Eucalyptus xanthonema, commonly known as the yellow box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or yellowish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. The plant has a long lifespan and is known for its resilience to drought and fire."
