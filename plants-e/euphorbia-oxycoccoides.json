    "intro": "Euphorbia oxycoccoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia oxycoccoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
