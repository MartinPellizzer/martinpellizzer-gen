    "intro": "Epipactis moratoria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, elongated, leafless stem that bears a single spike of white or pale green flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow in the acidic, wet soils of pine rocklands. Its flowers are highly specialized, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Epipactis moratoria is considered critically endangered and is protected in many areas."
