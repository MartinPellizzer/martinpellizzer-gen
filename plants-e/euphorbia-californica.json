    "intro": "Euphorbia californica, commonly known as the California milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a branched stem with smooth, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, which is a characteristic feature of many euphorbias. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Euphorbia californica plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
