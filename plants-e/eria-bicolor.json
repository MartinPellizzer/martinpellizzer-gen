The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and delicate, often arranged in clusters, and it produces a fragrant scent to attract pollinators. Eria bicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
