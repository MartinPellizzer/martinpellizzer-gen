    "intro": "Ephedra minor, commonly known as the small ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by wind. Ephedra minor is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems. Its chemical composition includes alkaloids such as ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine."
