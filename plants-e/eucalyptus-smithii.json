    "intro": "Eucalyptus smithii, commonly known as the Smith's malleable gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from grey to white in color. The plant produces creamy-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a rough, hairy texture. Eucalyptus smithii is adapted to dry conditions and is commonly found in heathlands and open forests."
