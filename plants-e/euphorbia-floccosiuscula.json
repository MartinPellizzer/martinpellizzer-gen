    "intro": "Euphorbia floccosiuscula, commonly known as the wooly euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
