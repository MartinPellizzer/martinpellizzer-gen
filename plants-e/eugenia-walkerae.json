    "intro": "Eugenia walkerae, commonly known as the purple-leafed eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a purplish tinge, especially when exposed to full sun. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, though it is not typically consumed by humans."
