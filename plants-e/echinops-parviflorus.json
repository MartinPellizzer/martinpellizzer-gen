    "intro": "Echinops parviflorus, commonly known as the smallflower thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the development of its characteristic echinoid (spiky) fruits. Echinops parviflorus typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
