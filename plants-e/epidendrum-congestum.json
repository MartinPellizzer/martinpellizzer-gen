    "intro": "Epidendrum congestum, commonly known as the clustered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Epidendrum congestum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
