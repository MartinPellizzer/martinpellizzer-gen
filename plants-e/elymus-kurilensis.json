    "intro": "Elymus kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Russian Far East and the Kuril Islands. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus kurilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
