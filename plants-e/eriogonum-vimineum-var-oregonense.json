    "intro": "Eriogonum vimineum var. oregonense, commonly known as the Oregon milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in dry slopes, gravelly soils, and open woodlands."
