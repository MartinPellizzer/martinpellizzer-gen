It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are usually glabrous, meaning they are smooth and lack hairs. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other varieties of Eriocaulon trilobatum."
