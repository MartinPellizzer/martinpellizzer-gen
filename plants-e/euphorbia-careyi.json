    "intro": "Euphorbia careyi, commonly known as the Cape Verde euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It features a branching stem covered in dense, spiny structures that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, allowing it to store water efficiently in arid environments. Euphorbia careyi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to dry conditions."
