    "intro": "Eragrostis diffusa, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and often have a bluish-gray appearance due to the presence of fine pubescence. Eragrostis diffusa is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, disturbed areas, and along roadsides."
