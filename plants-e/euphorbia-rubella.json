    "intro": "Euphorbia rubella, commonly known as the red-spotted spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, somewhat fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
