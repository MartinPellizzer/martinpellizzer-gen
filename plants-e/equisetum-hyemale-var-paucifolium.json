    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. paucifolium, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are clustered in a structure called a strobilus. It thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its simple, needle-like leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in many ancient plant species."
