    "intro": "Ecteinanthus ovatus, commonly known as the round-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant species native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It is often found in coastal or mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
