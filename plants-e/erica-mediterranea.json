    "intro": "Erica mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean heather, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Erica mediterranea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and rocky environments."
