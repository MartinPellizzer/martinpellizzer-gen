    "intro": "Euonymus rosthornii var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to reveal four winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated for horticultural purposes."
