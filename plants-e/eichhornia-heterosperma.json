    "intro": "Eichhornia heterosperma, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It possesses broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length and covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. It is known for its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its invasive nature, it can disrupt local ecosystems if not managed properly."
