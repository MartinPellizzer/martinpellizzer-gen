    "intro": "Euphorbia pisidica, commonly known as the Caucasian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features upright, branching stems covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Euphorbia pisidica is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
