    "intro": "Epidendrum arundinaceum, commonly known as the bamboo orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum arundinaceum is a hardy plant often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care."
