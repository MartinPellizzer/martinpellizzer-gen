It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a dense covering of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
