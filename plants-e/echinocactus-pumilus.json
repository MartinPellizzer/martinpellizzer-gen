    "intro": "Echinocactus pumilus, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the dry regions of Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in short, pale spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
