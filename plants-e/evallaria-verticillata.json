    "intro": "Evallaria verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Its flowers, which range in color from blue to purple, are typically tubular and attract a variety of pollinators. Evallaria verticillata prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings."
