    "intro": "Eupatorium piptopappum, commonly known as white boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures called pappus that aid in wind pollination. Its leaves are typically opposite, lance-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture. White boneset thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands."
