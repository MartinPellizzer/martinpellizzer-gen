    "intro": "Eupatorium vernoniopsis var. roseoviolaceum, commonly known as the purple-veined eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The leaves are typically opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. This variant is distinguished by its striking purple veins on the leaves, which give it its common name."
