    "intro": "Euryops prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It features small, bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
