    "intro": "Epidendrum transversovatum, commonly known as the Transverso-lateral Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, often pendulous growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in drier conditions, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor settings. Epidendrum transversovatum is a relatively hardy orchid that is popular among enthusiasts due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
