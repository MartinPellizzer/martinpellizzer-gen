    "intro": "Eragrostis macrochlamys var. wilmaniae, commonly known as the Wilman's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in pairs, with bracts that are longer than the florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions."
