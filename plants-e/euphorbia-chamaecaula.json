    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaecaula, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, multi-branched structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia chamaecaula is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
