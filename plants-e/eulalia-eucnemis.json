    "intro": "Eulalia eucnemis, commonly known as the slender grass or narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and tufted flowering heads, which are typical of the Poaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Eulalia eucnemis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
