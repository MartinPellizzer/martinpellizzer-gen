    "intro": "Eucalyptus derbyensis, commonly known as the Derbyensis gum tree, is a species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Queensland, Australia. It is a tall, slender tree that typically grows to heights of up to 20 meters, with a straight trunk and a narrow, spreading crown. The leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive blue-green color due to a dense covering of hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is well adapted to drought and can survive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
