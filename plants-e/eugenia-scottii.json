    "intro": "Eugenia scottii, commonly known as the Scott's guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
