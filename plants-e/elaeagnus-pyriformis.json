    "intro": "Elaeagnus pyriformis, commonly known as the silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are typically orange to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Elaeagnus pyriformis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility."
