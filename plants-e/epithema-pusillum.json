    "intro": "Epithema pusillum, commonly known as the small epithema, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a short, fibrous root system and a basal rosette of leaves that help it retain moisture. Epithema pusillum is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
