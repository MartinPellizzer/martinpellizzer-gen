    "intro": "Erica arborea f. saccata, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a variant of the Erica arborea species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and dense foliage of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardens in coastal and maritime climates."
