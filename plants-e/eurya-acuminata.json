    "intro": "Eurya acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped eurya, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Eurya acuminata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and seasonal interest."
