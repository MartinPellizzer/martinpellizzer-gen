    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris subsp. polycephala, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and it has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
