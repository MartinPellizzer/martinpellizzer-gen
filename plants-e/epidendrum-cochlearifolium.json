    "intro": "Epidendrum cochlearifolium, commonly known as the spiral-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive, almost helical appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are clustered in spikes and often display a range of colors, from white to pink and purple. Epidendrum cochlearifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
