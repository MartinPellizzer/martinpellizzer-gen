    "intro": "Epilobium angustifolium var. platyphyllum, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb or flatleaf willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. The plant features slender, often reddish stems that are usually hairless or sparsely hairy. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly toothed margin, and it produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical var. angustifolium, which contributes to its unique botanical identity."
