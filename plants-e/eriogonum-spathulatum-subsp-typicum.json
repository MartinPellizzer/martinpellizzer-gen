It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators. The subspecies typicum is distinguished by its more robust growth and broader leaves compared to other subspecies."
