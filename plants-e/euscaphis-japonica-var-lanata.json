It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
