    "intro": "Echinopsis subtilispina, commonly known as the Mexican moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and striking appearance. Echinopsis subtilispina requires well-draining soil and minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments."
