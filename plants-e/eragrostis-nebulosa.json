    "intro": "Eragrostis nebulosa, commonly known as the cloudgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its growth habit is typically clump-forming, and it can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Eragrostis nebulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
