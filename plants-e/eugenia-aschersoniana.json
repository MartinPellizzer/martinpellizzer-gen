    "intro": "Eugenia aschersoniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf guava, is a small evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellowish-orange fruits. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions makes it a popular ornamental and fruit-bearing plant. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
