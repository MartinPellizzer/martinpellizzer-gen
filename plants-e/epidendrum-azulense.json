    "intro": "Epidendrum azulense, commonly known as the Blue Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. Epidendrum azulense is valued in horticulture for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements."
