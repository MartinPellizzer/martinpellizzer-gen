    "intro": "Echinocereus baileyi var. albispinus, commonly known as the white-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and produces white to pale pink flowers during the spring. The plant is characterized by its white spines, which distinguish it from other varieties of Echinocereus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens and rockeries."
