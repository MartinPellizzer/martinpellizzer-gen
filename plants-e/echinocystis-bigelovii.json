    "intro": "Echinocystis bigelovii, commonly known as the giant burr cucumber, is a climbing vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, spiny fruits that resemble burrs, which can adhere to animals and clothing. The plant produces yellow flowers and has hairy, heart-shaped leaves. Its fruits are edible when young but become tough and fibrous as they mature. Echinocystis bigelovii is often found in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and desert edges."
