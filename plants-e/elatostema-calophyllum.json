    "intro": "Elatostema calophyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and they are clustered in dense inflorescences. Elatostema calophyllum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
