    "intro": "Epidendrum anoglossum, commonly known as the \"Lipstick Orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, lip-like flowers that are often red or orange in color. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive, elongated lip that is usually a different color from the rest of the flower. Epidendrum anoglossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
