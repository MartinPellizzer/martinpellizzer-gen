    "intro": "Euphorbia neocymosa, commonly known as the red-veined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia neocymosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
