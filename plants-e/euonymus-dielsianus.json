    "intro": "Euonymus dielsianus, commonly known as the Diels' euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which is typically associated with vines and herbs, making its classification somewhat unique. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for certain bird species. Euonymus dielsianus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
