    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila subsp. provincialis, commonly known as the Alpine marsh helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and wetlands at high altitudes. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
