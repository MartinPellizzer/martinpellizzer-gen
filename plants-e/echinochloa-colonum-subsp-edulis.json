    "intro": "Echinochloa colonum subsp. edulis, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Buffelgrass is often used for forage and soil stabilization in arid and semi-arid regions."
