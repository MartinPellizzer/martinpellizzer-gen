It is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are often glaucous, giving them a bluish-white waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by distinctive orange to red berries that persist into winter. Its foliage provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. Euonymus glaucus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
