It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils across the eastern United States. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. This grass plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
