    "intro": "Epilobium angustifolium f. albiflorum, commonly known as whiteflower willowherb, is a variant of the narrow-leaved willowherb. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. This form is distinguished by its predominantly white floral display, setting it apart from the typical pink or red flowers of the species."
