    "intro": "Euphorbia confinalis subsp. confinalis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry environments."
