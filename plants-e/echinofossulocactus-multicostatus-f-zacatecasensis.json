    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus multicostatus f. zacatecasensis, commonly known as the Zacatecas echinofossulocactus, is a unique cactus species native to the rocky landscapes of Zacatecas, Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered in inflorescences at the base of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
