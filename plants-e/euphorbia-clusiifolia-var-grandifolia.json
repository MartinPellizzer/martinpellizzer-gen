    "intro": "Euphorbia clusiifolia var. grandifolia, commonly known as the grandiflora euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid or semi-arid climates."
