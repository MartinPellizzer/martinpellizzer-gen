    "intro": "Elaphoglossum variabile, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Elaphoglossum variabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
