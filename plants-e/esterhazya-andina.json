    "intro": "Esterhazya andina, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Esterhazya andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
