    "intro": "Elytrigia stipifolia var. cretacea, commonly known as the Cretan bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Crete. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
