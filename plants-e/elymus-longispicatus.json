    "intro": "Elymus longispicatus, commonly known as the long-spiked wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus longispicatus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging environments."
