    "intro": "Epidendrum carnosum var. nutans, commonly known as the hanging Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are fleshy and thick, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
