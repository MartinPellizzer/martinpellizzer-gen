    "intro": "Equisetum bogotense var. polystachyum, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 horse-tail, is a variant of the horsetail plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, typical of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its presence indicates a stable, humid environment with minimal disturbance."
