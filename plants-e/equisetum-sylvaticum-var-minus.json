    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser field horsetail, is a diminutive variety of the horsetail plant characterized by its reduced height and slender, segmented stems. It possesses a unique morphology with whorls of small, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called strobili, are cone-like and contain spore-producing organs. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
