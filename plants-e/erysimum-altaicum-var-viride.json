It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. This variety is distinguished by its distinctively green foliage, which contrasts with the yellow flowers, making it a notable plant in its habitat."
