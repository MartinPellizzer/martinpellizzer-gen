    "intro": "Exorrhiza thurstonii, commonly known as the Thurston's exorrhiza, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its specialized root system. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and exhibits epiphytic growth habits. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are modified to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, a feature common in many epiphytic plants. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
