The plant is typically found in moist, woodland habitats and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. It has a tall, upright growth habit and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly fuzzy texture, adding to its distinctive appearance."
