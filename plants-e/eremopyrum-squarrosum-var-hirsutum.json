    "intro": "Eremopyrum squarrosum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy eremopyrum, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low soil moisture. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitats."
