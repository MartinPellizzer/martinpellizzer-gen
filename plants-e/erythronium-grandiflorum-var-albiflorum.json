    "intro": "Erythronium grandiflorum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered dog's mercury, is a variant of the erythronium plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are predominantly white, giving it its common name. It typically blooms in early spring and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
