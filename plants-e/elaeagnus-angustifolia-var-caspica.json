    "intro": "Elaeagnus angustifolia var. caspica, commonly known as silver leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by reddish-brown berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
