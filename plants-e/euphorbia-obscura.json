    "intro": "Euphorbia obscura, commonly known as the obscure spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its arid environment. Its milky sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
