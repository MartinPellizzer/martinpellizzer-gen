    "intro": "Eriocnema hilariana, commonly known as the Hilariana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length and are covered in a dense, white, woolly coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellowish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries it produces. This species is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical rainforests."
