It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flower heads that resemble a thistle, surrounded by bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in fine hairs. Eryngium mauritanicum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and hardy nature."
