    "intro": "Erica botuliformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, and it produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Erica botuliformis is well adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
