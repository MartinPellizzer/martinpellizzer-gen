    "intro": "Eutoca glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular eutoca, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it its scientific name. Eutoca glandulosa is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and habitat preferences."
