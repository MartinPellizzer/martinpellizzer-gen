    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale greenish or yellowish flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. The species is noted for its morphological variation and is often confused with other similar orchid species."
