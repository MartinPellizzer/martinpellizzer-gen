It is characterized by its dark green, glabrous stems and broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in suitable conditions."
