    "intro": "Erodium elongatum, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as roadsides and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy calyx that persists after flowering, aiding in seed dispersal."
