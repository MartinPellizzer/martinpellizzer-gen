    "intro": "Euphorbia alsinoides, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
