    "intro": "Etubila ferruginea, commonly known as the rust-colored orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often hairy appearance. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a reddish-brown rust-like pigment, giving it its common name. It produces delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pale pink. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
