    "intro": "Elatostema sessile var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. This variant is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Elatostema sessile."
