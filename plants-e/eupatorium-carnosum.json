    "intro": "Eupatorium carnosum, commonly known as rough skeletonweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Eupatorium carnosum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction."
