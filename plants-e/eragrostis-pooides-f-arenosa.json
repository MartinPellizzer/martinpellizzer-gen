    "intro": "Eragrostis pooides f. arenosa, commonly known as the sand panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for harsh environments. Its botanical features make it a hardy species often used in ecological restoration projects."
