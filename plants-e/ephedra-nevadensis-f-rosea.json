    "intro": "Ephedra nevadensis f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered jointfir, is a rare and striking variant of the Ephedra genus native to the western United States. It is characterized by its unique pink to rose-colored flowers, which contrast with its green, scale-like leaves. The plant is a shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its stems are woody and branched, with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
