    "intro": "Evacopsis polycephala, commonly known as the many-headed evacopsis, is a unique plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences that resemble a crown of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, hairy leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Evacopsis polycephala is considered an endangered species."
