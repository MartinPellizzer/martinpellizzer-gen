    "intro": "Eriachne ovata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf flat sedge, is a low-growing perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are usually pale green or brown in color. It thrives in wet or seasonally waterlogged soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
