    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. triumfetti, commonly known as yellow-spined leaf euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
