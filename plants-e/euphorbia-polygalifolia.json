    "intro": "Euphorbia polygalifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, a distinctive feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
