    "intro": "Elymus farctus subsp. rechingeri, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its robust growth and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble needles, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in late summer. This subspecies plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
