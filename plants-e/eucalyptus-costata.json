    "intro": "Eucalyptus costata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. Eucalyptus costata is well adapted to arid conditions and is an important component of the local flora in its native range."
