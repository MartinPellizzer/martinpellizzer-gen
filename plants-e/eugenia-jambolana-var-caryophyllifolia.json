    "intro": "Eugenia jambolana var. caryophyllifolia, commonly known as the Java cherry or Java apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe, containing a single seed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. The variety is distinguished by its slightly larger, more aromatic leaves compared to the typical Eugenia jambolana."
