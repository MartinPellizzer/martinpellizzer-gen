    "intro": "Elateriopsis oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's elaterium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes willows and evening primroses. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Elateriopsis oerstedii is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall."
