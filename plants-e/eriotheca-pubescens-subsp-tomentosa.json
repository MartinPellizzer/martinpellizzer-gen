    "intro": "Eriotheca pubescens subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly eriotheca, is a small evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, leathery fruits. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and often have a rough texture. This species is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high rainfall."
