    "intro": "Epithema benthamii, commonly known as the bentham's epithema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Epithema benthamii is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
