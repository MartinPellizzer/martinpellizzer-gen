    "intro": "Eugenia subamplexicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andes and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are broad and often slightly lobed, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
