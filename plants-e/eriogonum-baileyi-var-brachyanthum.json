    "intro": "Eriogonum baileyi var. brachyanthum, commonly known as the bristlecone eriogonum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers, which are pink to reddish in color, bloom in early spring and attract various pollinators."
