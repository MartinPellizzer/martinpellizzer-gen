    "intro": "Eurybia ramulosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its sturdy stems and drought-tolerant nature make it well-suited for coastal landscapes. Eurybia ramulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize dunes."
