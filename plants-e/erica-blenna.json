    "intro": "Erica blenna, commonly known as the coastal heather, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Erica blenna thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various insect species."
