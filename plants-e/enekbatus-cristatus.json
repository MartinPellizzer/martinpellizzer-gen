    "intro": "Enekbatus cristatus, commonly known as the crowned fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy areas with abundant sunlight. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens. However, it is important to note that it can spread rapidly and may become invasive in non-native environments."
