    "intro": "Epidendrum flos-aeris, commonly known as the skyflower, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble floating petals, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its inflorescence consists of multiple clusters of bright yellow or white blooms, which are often fragrant. The leaves are usually long and narrow, adapted for capturing sunlight in its natural habitat."
