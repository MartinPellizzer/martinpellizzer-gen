It features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces a single, showy flower with a yellow lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in pine flatwoods and hardwood hammocks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant touch to the undergrowth. The species is named in honor of botanist John K. Correll, reflecting its significance in botanical research."
