    "intro": "Epidendrum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered epidendron, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically features two flowers per spike, which bloom sequentially, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum biflorum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its resilience and beauty."
