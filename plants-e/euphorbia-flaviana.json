    "intro": "Euphorbia flaviana, commonly known as the yellow spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
