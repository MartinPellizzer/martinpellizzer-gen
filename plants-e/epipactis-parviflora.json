    "intro": "Epipactis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Epipactis parviflora is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, showcasing a complex symbiotic relationship with soil microbes."
