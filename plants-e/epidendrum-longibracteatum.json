It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, warm environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers bloom in clusters, making it a popular choice for both ornamental gardens and botanical collections."
