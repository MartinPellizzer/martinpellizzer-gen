    "intro": "Epidendrum panthera, commonly known as the Panther Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a contrasting dark center. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Epidendrum panthera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
