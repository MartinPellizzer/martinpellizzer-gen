    "intro": "Eltroplectris misera, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant prefers moist, boggy habitats and is often found in swampy areas with rich, organic soil. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Eltroplectris misera is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
