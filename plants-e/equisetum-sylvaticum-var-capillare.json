    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum var. capillare, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures, which are typical of horsetails. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, a feature that distinguishes it from flowering plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living seedless vascular plants."
