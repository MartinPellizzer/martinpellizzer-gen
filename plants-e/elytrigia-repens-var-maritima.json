    "intro": "Elytrigia repens var. maritima, commonly known as beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted shoots that form dense mats. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles. This plant is adapted to salty, windy environments and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion along shorelines."
