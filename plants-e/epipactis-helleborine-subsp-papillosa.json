    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. papillosa, commonly known as the hairy helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a tall, erect stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a contrasting red or purple lip, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of hairy structures on the petals and sepals, giving it its common name."
