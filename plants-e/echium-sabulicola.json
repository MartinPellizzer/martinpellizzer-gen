    "intro": "Echium sabulicola, commonly known as the sand evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous small, oily seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its unique pollination strategy and habitat preferences, it is considered an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
