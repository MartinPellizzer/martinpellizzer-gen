    "intro": "Euphorbia marginata var. uloleuca, commonly known as the white-margin euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with a pale green or white color, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
