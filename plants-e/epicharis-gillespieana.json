    "intro": "Epicharis gillespieana, commonly known as the Gillespie's epicharis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
