    "intro": "Epidendrum ovatum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Epidendrum ovatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
