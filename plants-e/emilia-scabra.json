    "intro": "Emilia scabra, commonly known as the common emilia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, slightly hairy appearance. The plant has alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on both surfaces. Emilia scabra is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open areas. It is also valued in some regions for its use in herbal medicine."
