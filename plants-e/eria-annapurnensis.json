    "intro": "Eria annapurnensis, commonly known as the Annapurna orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria annapurnensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
