It is characterized by its vibrant red to purple foliage, which becomes particularly striking in the autumn season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its seasonal color changes."
