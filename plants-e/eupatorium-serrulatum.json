    "intro": "Eupatorium serrulatum, commonly known as narrowleaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many flowering plants with composite flower heads. Eupatorium serrulatum is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinators."
