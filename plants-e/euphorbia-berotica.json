It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red spines and fleshy, water-storing stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized flower-like structures. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
