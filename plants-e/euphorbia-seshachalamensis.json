    "intro": "Euphorbia seshachalamensis, commonly known as the Seshachalam spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems are broken, a common trait among members of the spurge family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
