It is a trailing vine that produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is characterized by its long, winding stems that often trail along the ground. It blooms throughout the growing season, typically from spring to early autumn. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
