It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy, and their stems are usually erect and unbranched. Endocellion species are native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where they thrive in full sun to partial shade."
