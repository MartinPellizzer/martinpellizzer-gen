    "intro": "Eriophyllum croceum, commonly known as the golden poppy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in sandy or gravelly habitats. Eriophyllum croceum is also known for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
