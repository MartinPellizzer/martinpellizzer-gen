    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale var. arvensiforme, commonly known as the coastal horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum litorale and Equisetum arvensis. It is a perennial herb that thrives in wet, saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant features a tall, sparsely branched stem with whorled leaves, and its reproductive structures include spore-bearing strobila. Its morphology is adapted to tolerate high salinity and frequent tidal flooding. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting specialized invertebrate communities."
