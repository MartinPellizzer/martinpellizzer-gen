These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Ecliptica species are typically herbaceous, with lance-shaped leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. They often grow in moist, disturbed soils and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Some species are cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and flower structure."
