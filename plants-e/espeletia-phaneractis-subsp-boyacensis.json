    "intro": "Espeletia phaneractis subsp. boyacensis, commonly known as the Boyacensis heath, is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure, with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils at high altitudes, typically above 2,500 meters. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered an important species for ecological studies in Andean ecosystems."
