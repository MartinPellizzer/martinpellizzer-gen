    "intro": "Eutacta pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri's eutacta, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic, a trait common in many members of its family. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
