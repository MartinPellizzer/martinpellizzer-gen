    "intro": "Epidendrum longipetalum var. tortipetalum, commonly known as the twisted-petaled epidendrum, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often twisted petals that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive."
