    "intro": "Euphrasia arctica subsp. borealis, commonly known as Arctic eyebright, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically features small, yellowish flowers with prominent dark markings, which are characteristic of the genus Euphrasia. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette, helping to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. This species plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
