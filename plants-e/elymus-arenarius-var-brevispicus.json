It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear short, blunt awns. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This variety is often found in disturbed or open habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control."
