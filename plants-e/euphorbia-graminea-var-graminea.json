    "intro": "Euphorbia graminea var. graminea, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with a spindly, branching stem and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
