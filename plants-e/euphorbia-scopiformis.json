    "intro": "Euphorbia scopiformis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically small, green, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia scopiformis is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
