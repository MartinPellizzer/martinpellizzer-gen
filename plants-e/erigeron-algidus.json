    "intro": "Erigeron algidus, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erigeron algidus is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing, mat-forming structure to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
