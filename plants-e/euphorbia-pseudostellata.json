    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudostellata, commonly known as the star spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of many succulents. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. However, it is important to note that it contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
