It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
