    "intro": "Echinopsis bolligeriana, commonly known as the Bolliger's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces large, white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. Echinopsis bolligeriana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid environments."
