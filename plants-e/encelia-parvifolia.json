    "intro": "Encelia parvifolia, commonly known as the smallflower iceplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features gray-green, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to its landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy habitats. Encelia parvifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
