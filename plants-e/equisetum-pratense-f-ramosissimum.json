    "intro": "Equisetum pratense f. ramosissimum, commonly known as the hairy field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in soft, green, scale-like structures. The plant produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing spore-bearing cones at the tips. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, typically in wetlands or along stream banks. This fern ally is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
