    "intro": "Elaphoglossum prainii, commonly known as the Prain's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are often covered with a layer of indusia. Elaphoglossum prainii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
