It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green with white margins, giving it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Equisetum albomarginatum is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
