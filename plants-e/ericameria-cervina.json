    "intro": "Ericameria cervina, commonly known as the Sierra sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ericameria cervina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife."
