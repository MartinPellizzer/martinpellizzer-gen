    "intro": "Eremogone androsacea, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Eremogone androsacea is often found in desert scrub and sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
