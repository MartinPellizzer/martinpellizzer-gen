It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
