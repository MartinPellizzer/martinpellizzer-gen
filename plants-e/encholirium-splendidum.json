It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky inflorescence that resembles a crown, hence its common name. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. Encholirium splendidum is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
