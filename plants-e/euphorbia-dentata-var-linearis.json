    "intro": "Euphorbia dentata var. linearis, commonly known as the linear leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry plains. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
