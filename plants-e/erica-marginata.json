    "intro": "Erica marginata, commonly known as the coastal heath or narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas with high wind exposure. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Erica marginata is well adapted to coastal conditions, with a deep root system that anchors it against strong winds and salt spray."
