    "intro": "Etlingera aulocheilos, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a dense rosette around the flowering stem. The botanical features of Etlingera aulocheilos make it a distinctive and visually appealing addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
