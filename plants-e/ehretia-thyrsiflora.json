    "intro": "Ehretia thyrsiflora, commonly known as the thornapple or thorned hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in forest margins. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
