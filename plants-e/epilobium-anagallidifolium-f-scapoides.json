    "intro": "Epilobium anagallidifolium f. scapoides, commonly known as the scapoid willowherb, is a flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, pink to red, and clustered in racemes, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators. This subspecies is characterized by its reduced leaf structure and elongated stem, distinguishing it from the typical form of Epilobium anagallidifolium."
