    "intro": "Elytraria cubana, commonly known as the Cuban elytraria, is a flowering plant native to Cuba. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Elytraria cubana is typically found in moist, open areas such as coastal dunes and sandy soils."
