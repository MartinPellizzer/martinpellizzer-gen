    "intro": "Echtrus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and elusive plant species found in specific tropical rainforest habitats. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a unique ability to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for propagation. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, Echtrus is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
