    "intro": "Eremopyrum confusum var. pakistanicum, commonly known as the Kashmir false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
