    "intro": "Epidendrum barringtoniae, commonly known as the Barrington's epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
