It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant.
