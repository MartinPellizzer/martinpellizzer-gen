    "intro": "Epinetrum mangenotii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. Epinetrum mangenotii is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
