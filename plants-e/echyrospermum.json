    "intro": "Echyrospermum, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their silver or gray-green foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are typically yellow with a central disk, and they produce small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Echyrospermum species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance. They thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
