It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.
