    "intro": "Euphorbia gerardiana var. homophylla, commonly known as the Armenian spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has smooth, succulent leaves that are often mistaken for stems, a feature common in many euphorbias. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
