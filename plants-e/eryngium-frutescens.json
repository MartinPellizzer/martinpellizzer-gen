    "intro": "Eryngium frutescens, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-to-purple flower heads and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its structure is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions, making it a hardy perennial. Eryngium frutescens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
