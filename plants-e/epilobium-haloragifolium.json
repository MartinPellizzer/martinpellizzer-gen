    "intro": "Epilobium haloragifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
