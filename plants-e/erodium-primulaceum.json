    "intro": "Erodium primulaceum, commonly known as the common stickyweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a sticky surface, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and roadside areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
