    "intro": "Eleocharis pygmaea var. anachaeta, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikelets that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and its roots are often found in wetland or marshy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other forms of Eleocharis pygmaea."
