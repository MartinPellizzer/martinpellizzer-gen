    "intro": "Eriogonum compositum var. simplex, commonly known as the simple composite buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its simple, leaf-like bracts that resemble leaves rather than the typical compound leaves of other buckwheat species. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native habitat, supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
