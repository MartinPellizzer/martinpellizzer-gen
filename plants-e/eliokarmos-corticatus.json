    "intro": "Eliokarmos corticatus, commonly known as the bark lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on tree bark, especially on conifers, in temperate and boreal forest regions. The thallus is usually pale to dark green, with a leathery texture and distinct, irregularly shaped lobes. It lacks true leaves but has a photosynthetic layer called the photobiont, which contains green algae. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
