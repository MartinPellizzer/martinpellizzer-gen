    "intro": "Echium fuerteventurae, commonly known as the Fuerteventura thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting to the arid climate of its native habitat. It produces a tall, erect stem with showy bracts that surround the flower cluster. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
