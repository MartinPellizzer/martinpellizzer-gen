    "intro": "Elaphoglossum squarrosum f. genuina, commonly known as the Genuina Shield Fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive morphology and ecological preferences. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features finely divided, serrated fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, shield-like shape, giving it its common name. Its spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the genus Elaphoglossum. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
