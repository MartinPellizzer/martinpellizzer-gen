    "intro": "Elymus europaeus, commonly known as European wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each branch, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus europaeus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
