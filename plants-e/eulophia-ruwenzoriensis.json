    "intro": "Eulophia ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically blooms in the cooler months, producing fragrant, violet-colored blossoms that attract pollinators. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species."
