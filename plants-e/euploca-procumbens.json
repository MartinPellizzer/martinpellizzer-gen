    "intro": "Euploca procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate euploca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically spreads along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Euploca procumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
