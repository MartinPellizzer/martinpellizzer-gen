    "intro": "Epipogium generalis, commonly known as the common ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Europe. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures that are not true flowers but are instead specialized shoots called \"candles.\" It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
