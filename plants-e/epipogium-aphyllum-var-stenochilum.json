    "intro": "Epipogium aphyllum var. stenochilum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped ghost orchid, is a rare and mycorrhizal orchid that lacks visible leaves and chlorophyll. It relies entirely on its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient acquisition, making it a unique example of myco-heterotrophy. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip that sets it apart from other epipogium species. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest floors in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered in many areas."
