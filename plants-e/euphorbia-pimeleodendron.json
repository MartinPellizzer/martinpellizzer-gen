    "intro": "Euphorbia pimeleodendron, commonly known as the red-veined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant features bright green leaves with striking red veins, adding to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
