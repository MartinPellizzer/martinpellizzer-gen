    "intro": "Echinocereus koehresianus subsp. gruberianus, commonly known as the Gruber's hedgehog cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles and produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
