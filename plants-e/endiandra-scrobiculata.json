    "intro": "Endiandra scrobiculata, commonly known as the Malayan sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing smooth, oval seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
