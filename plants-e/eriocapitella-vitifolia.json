It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with elliptical leaves that are often slightly hairy. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
