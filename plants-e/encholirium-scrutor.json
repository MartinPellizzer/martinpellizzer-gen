    "intro": "Encholirium scrutor, commonly known as the Mexican firecracker, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its inconspicuous flowers, which are typically yellow or orange. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its rosette-shaped leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Encholirium scrutor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light."
