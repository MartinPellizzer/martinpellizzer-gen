    "intro": "Eriocaulon schultzii, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form a network that helps stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. Eriocaulon schultzii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist environments."
