    "intro": "Epidendrum pubiflorum, commonly known as the hairy-flowered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, arching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Epidendrum pubiflorum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
