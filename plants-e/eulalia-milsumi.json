    "intro": "Eulalia milsumi, commonly known as the Milsum's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
