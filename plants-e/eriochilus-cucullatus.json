    "intro": "Eriochilus cucullatus, commonly known as the helmeted rock-rush, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette, helping it to retain moisture in arid conditions. Eriochilus cucullatus is well adapted to coastal and inland habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
