It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive revolute margin.

This species is of interest to botanists due to its morphological features and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
