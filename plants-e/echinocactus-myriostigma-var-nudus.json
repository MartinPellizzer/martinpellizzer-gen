    "intro": "Echinocactus myriostigma var. nudus, commonly known as the naked hedgehog cactus, is a unique variant of the hedgehog cactus species. It is characterized by its lack of spines, giving it a smooth, almost hairless appearance. This plant is native to the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its structure consists of a short, thick stem with clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its distinct appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
