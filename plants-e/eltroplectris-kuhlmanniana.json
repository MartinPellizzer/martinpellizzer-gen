    "intro": "Eltroplectris kuhlmanniana, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. The fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a visually appealing addition to shaded gardens."
