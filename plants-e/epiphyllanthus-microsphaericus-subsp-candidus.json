    "intro": "Epiphyllanthus microsphaericus subsp. candidus, commonly known as the white-stemmed epiphyllanthus, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific tropical environments. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and unique reproductive structures that facilitate its epiphytic lifestyle. The plant thrives in humid, shaded conditions, often growing on the trunks or branches of trees. Its flowers are typically white or pale in color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
