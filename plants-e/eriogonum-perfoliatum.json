    "intro": "Eriogonum perfoliatum, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. Its leaves are often fused around the stem, a feature known as perfoliate, which gives it its scientific name. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
