    "intro": "Eremophila mackinlayi subsp. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf eremophila, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in gardens."
