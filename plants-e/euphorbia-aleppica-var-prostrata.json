    "intro": "Euphorbia aleppica var. prostrata, commonly known as the Aleppo spurge or prostrate spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 (flowers) surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
