    "intro": "Euphorbia dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a succulent, cylindrical stem that is often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia dalmatica is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is known for its ability to store water in its stems."
