    "intro": "Eucalyptus fibrosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fibrous bark, which is typically smooth and peeling in patches, and its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery hair. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in spring. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and heat. Eucalyptus fibrosa is an important component of the mallee ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
