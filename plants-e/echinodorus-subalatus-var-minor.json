    "intro": "Echinodorus subalatus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf echinodorus, is a compact aquatic plant native to South America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent central vein. This variety thrives in freshwater environments with moderate to high light conditions and is often used in aquariums for its ornamental value. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate. The plant is relatively hardy and adaptable, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced aquarists."
