    "intro": "Ecbolium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet leaf or velvet thorn, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its hairy, velvety texture gives it its common name, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and the plant can grow as a shrub or a climbing vine."
