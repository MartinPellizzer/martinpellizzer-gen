    "intro": "Euonymus laxus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, orb-shaped fruits that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
