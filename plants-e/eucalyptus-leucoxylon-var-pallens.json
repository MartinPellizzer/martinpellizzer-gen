    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucoxylon var. pallens, commonly known as the white box gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to white bark that peels in long strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a whitish or silver underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pink or red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
