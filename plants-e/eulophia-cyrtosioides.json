It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and a spike of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil in its natural habitat. Eulophia cyrtosioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
