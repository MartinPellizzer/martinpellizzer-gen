It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces red, lantern-like fruits that are striking in autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for hedging or as a specimen plant."
