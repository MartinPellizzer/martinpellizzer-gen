    "intro": "Euphorbia rangovalensis, commonly known as the Rangoon euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Euphorbia rangovalensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to dry environments."
