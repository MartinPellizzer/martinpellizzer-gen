    "intro": "Elopium, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens. The leaves are typically palmately divided, giving the plant a distinctive, delicate appearance. Elopium species are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Many species are considered weeds, but some are cultivated for their ornamental value."
