    "intro": "Euptelea minor, commonly known as the Chinese magnolia or the narrow-leaved magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a pointed tip and a rough texture. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the base of the shoots, and it produces small, dark blue berries in the fall. Euptelea minor is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
