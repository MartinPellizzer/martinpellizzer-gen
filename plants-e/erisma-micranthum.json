    "intro": "Erisma micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered erisma, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Erisma micranthum is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local pollinators."
