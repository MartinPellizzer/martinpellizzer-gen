    "intro": "Eleocharis oxystachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikelets that produce minute, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the stabilization of wetland soils. Eleocharis oxystachys plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and serves as a food source for waterfowl."
