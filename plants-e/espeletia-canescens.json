    "intro": "Espeletia canescens, commonly known as the woolly tree heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as paramo ecosystems, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same plant. Espeletia canescens plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various native species."
