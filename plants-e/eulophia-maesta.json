    "intro": "Eulophia maesta, commonly known as the noble eulophia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces numerous small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Eulophia maesta thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
