    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosenstock's harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive, lanceolate-shaped fronds with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, typically arranged in a single row along the veins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions. Elaphoglossum rosenstockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
