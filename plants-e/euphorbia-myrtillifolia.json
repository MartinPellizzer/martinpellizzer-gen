    "intro": "Euphorbia myrtillifolia, commonly known as the myrtleleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia myrtillifolia is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
