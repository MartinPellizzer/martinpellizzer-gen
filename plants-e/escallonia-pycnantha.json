    "intro": "Escallonia pycnantha, commonly known as the Christmas bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Escallonia pycnantha is also valued for its winter interest and ability to attract pollinators."
