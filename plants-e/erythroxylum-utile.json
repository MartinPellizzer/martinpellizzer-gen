    "intro": "Erythroxylum utile, commonly known as the red balsa tree, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy red flowers. The plant is notable for its lightweight, porous wood, which is highly valued for construction and model-making. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Despite its economic importance, it is not related to the coca plant, which is a different species within the same genus."
