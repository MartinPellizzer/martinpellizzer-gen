    "intro": "Erxlebenia rosea, commonly known as the roseleaf erxlebenia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Erxlebenia rosea is often found in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
