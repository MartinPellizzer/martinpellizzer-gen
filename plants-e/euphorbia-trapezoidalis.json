    "intro": "Euphorbia trapezoidalis, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia trapezoidalis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
