    "intro": "Eucalyptus oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Eucalyptus oblonga plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
