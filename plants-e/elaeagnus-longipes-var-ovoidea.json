    "intro": "Elaeagnus longipes var. ovoidea, commonly known as the ovalleaf silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically silver-green in color. The plant produces yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, edible berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its silvery foliage and autumn coloration make it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler regions."
