    "intro": "Eugenia bimarginata var. umbellaris, commonly known as the Umbrella Eugenia, is a species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters. The plant is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by small, edible, red berries that are a source of nectar for native birds. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
