    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 gayeri, commonly known as the hybrid spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
