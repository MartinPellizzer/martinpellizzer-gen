    "intro": "Echinocactus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red or orange fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Echinocactus bicolor is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
