    "intro": "Eudistemon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads that resemble those of the genus Echium. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eudistemon is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is found in various parts of the Mediterranean region."
