    "intro": "Emilia moutsamboteana, commonly known as the Madagascar dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the dandelion genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Emilia moutsamboteana is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas."
