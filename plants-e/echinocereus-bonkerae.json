    "intro": "Echinocereus bonkerae, commonly known as the Bonkera's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically present when the plant is young but are lost as it matures. Echinocereus bonkerae is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
