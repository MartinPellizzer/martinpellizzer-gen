It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing small seeds. This subspecies is part of the broader Eucalyptus goniantha species group, which includes several other closely related taxa."
