It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and woody stems that are often branched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers and red or yellow berries, which are adapted to the harsh environmental conditions. Ephedra brevifoliata is part of the Ephedraceae family and is known for its historical use in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in dry climates with limited water availability."
