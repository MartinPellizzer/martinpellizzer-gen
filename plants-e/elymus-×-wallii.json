It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Elymus \u00d7 wallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes."
