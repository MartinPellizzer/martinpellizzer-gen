    "intro": "Evodiopanax evodiifolius var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender-leafed evodiopanax, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a pinnate pattern, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountainous regions or dense forests. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but under-researched species."
