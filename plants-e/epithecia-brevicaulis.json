    "intro": "Epithecia brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed epithecia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its small, crust-like thallus that grows on rock surfaces, typically in temperate and alpine regions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific type of green alga, which provides photosynthetic capabilities. Its morphology includes a tightly adherent, leathery structure with a distinct, pale to yellowish coloration. Epithecia brevicaulis is often found in shaded, moist environments and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
