    "intro": "Eryngium humile var. caulescens, commonly known as the dwarf thistle or small eryngium, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, spiny foliage and produces small, blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
