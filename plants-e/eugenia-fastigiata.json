    "intro": "Eugenia fastigiata, commonly known as the evergreen hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red as it matures. Eugenia fastigiata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and continuous flowering."
