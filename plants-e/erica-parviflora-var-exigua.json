    "intro": "Erica parviflora var. exigua, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It typically reaches a height of no more than 10 centimeters, with compact, dense foliage consisting of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, native plants."
