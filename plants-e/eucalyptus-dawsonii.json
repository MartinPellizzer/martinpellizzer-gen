    "intro": "Eucalyptus dawsonii, commonly known as Dawson's mallet, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a distinctive aromatic scent. Eucalyptus dawsonii is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
