    "intro": "Empetrum pinnatum, commonly known as the snowberry or wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for humans and birds, though they are often described as having a tart flavor. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Empetrum pinnatum is often found in alpine and tundra environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
