    "intro": "Eleocharis atropurpurea var. setiformis, commonly known as purple spike-rush, is a grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that is often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its slender, wiry stems are covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
