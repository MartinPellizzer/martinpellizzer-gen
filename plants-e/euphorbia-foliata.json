    "intro": "Euphorbia foliata, commonly known as the leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
