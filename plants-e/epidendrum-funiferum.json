    "intro": "Epidendrum funiferum, commonly known as the sky orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blooms. Epidendrum funiferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
