    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli subsp. hispidula, commonly known as rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brown florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks, and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. It produces wind-dispersed seeds that can persist in the soil for several years, contributing to its invasive potential in certain environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and denser pubescence compared to other members of the Echinochloa genus."
