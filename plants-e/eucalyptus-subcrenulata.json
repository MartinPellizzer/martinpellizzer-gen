    "intro": "Eucalyptus subcrenulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The tree typically grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, appearing in clusters and attracting various pollinators. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native vegetation."
