    "intro": "Elymus striatus var. propinquus, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing spikelets with two to three bract-like glumes. This variety is valued for its adaptability and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
