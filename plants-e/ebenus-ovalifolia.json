    "intro": "Ebenus ovalifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. Ebenus ovalifolia is often used in xerophytic gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
