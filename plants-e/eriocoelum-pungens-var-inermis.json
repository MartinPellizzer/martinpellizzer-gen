    "intro": "Eriocoelum pungens var. inermis, commonly known as the smoothleaf eriocoelum, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically features simple, opposite leaves that are smooth and glossy, with a lanceolate shape. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the warmer months. The varietal name 'inermis' refers to its lack of thorns, distinguishing it from the typical variety of Eriocoelum pungens."
