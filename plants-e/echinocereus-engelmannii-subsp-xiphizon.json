    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. xiphizon, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a ribbed stem and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has spiny, tuberculate stems that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its thick stems allows it to thrive in harsh desert conditions."
