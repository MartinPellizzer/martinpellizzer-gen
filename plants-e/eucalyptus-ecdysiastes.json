    "intro": "Eucalyptus ecdysiastes, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a species native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in coastal and semi-coastal regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark grey to black bark, which peels in thin, fibrous strips. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly aromatic scent. The flowers are small and white or pale blue, appearing in clusters, and the tree produces woody capsules containing seeds."
