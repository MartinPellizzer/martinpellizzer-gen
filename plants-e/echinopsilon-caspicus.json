    "intro": "Echinopsilon caspicus, commonly known as the Caspian spurge, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Echinopsilon caspicus is often found in steppe and desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
