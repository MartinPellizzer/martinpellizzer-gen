    "intro": "Echinodorus bracteatus subsp. efenestratus, commonly known as the broad-leaf waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to South America. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, though they can occasionally emerge above water. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. This species is popular in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
