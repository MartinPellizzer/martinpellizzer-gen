    "intro": "Eucalyptus foelscheana, commonly known as the Foelsche's malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in mallee woodlands and open forests. Eucalyptus foelscheana is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ecological value."
