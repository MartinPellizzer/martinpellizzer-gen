    "intro": "Epidendrum williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically produces showy, spurred flowers that are often bisexual, with a distinct lip or labellum. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum williamsii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
