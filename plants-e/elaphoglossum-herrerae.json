    "intro": "Elaphoglossum herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that resemble those of holly leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Elaphoglossum herrerae is considered a conservation concern."
