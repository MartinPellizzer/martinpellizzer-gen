    "intro": "Erica tetralix var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in rocky or coastal environments."
