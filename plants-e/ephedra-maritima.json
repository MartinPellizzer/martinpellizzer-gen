    "intro": "Ephedra maritima, commonly known as sea ephedra, is a small, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and red or orange fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or near the shoreline. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or in restoration projects."
