    "intro": "Ebenus micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ebenus micrantha is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
