    "intro": "Eschscholzia lacera, commonly known as the slender poppy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eschscholzia lacera is part of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other poppy species known for their showy flowers and medicinal properties."
