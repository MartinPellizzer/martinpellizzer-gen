    "intro": "Ericameria viscidiflora var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf ericameria, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow to broadly elliptic, with a glandular surface that gives them a sticky texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
