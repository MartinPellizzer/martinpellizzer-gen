    "intro": "Eryngium atlanticum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-gray foliage and striking, thistle-like purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Eryngium atlanticum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in coastal ecosystems."
