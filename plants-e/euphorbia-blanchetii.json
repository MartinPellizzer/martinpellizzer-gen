    "intro": "Euphorbia blanchetii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is smooth and often has a pale or greenish tint, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Euphorbia blanchetii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
