    "intro": "Euonymus radicans var. acutus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a slightly pointed tip. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its resistance to pests and diseases."
