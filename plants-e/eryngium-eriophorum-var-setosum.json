    "intro": "Eryngium eriophorum var. setosum, commonly known as the bristly thistle, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a robust, upright stem covered in dense, spiny bracts that give it a distinctive, thistle-like appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is often found in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and along pathways, where it thrives in full sun."
