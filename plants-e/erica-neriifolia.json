    "intro": "Erica neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leaved heath, is a compact shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dark, glossy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica neriifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
