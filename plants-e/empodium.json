These plants are native to the mountainous regions of Asia and are characterized by their unique, bell-shaped flowers that often appear in clusters. The leaves are typically broad and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blooms. Empodium species are often found in shaded, moist environments, thriving in cool climates. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and subtle floral display."
