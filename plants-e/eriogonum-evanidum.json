It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds via wind. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
