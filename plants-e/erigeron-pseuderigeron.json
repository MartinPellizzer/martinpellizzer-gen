It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments."
