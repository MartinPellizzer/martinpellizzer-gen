    "intro": "Equisetum tenellum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the order Equisetales. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Equisetum tenellum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species."
