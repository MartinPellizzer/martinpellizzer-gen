    "intro": "Eutrema rossii, commonly known as Ross's sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
