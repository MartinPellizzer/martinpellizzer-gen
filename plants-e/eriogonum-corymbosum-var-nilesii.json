    "intro": "Eriogonum corymbosum var. nilesii, commonly known as the Niles' buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in California's coastal and inland regions."
