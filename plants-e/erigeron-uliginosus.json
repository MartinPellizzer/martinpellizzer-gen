    "intro": "Erigeron uliginosus, commonly known as swamp fleabane, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, often disturbed soils, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disc florets. It blooms from late spring to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Swamp fleabane is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide ecological benefits."
