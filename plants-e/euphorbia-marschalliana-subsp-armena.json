    "intro": "Euphorbia marschalliana subsp. armena, commonly known as Armenian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
