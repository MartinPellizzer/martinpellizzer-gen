    "intro": "Euphorbia balsamea, commonly known as blistering euphorbia, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features a smooth, succulent stem covered with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds that can cause skin irritation, making it a potentially hazardous plant to handle. Euphorbia balsamea thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides."
