    "intro": "Euphorbia sharmae, commonly known as the Sharma's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments and stores water in its stems to endure long periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
