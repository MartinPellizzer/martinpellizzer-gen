    "intro": "Eriogonum panguicense var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and narrow, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is part of the Eriogonum genus, which includes many species of flowering plants commonly found in western North America and South America."
