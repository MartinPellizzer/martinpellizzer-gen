    "intro": "Euphorbia mauritanica var. corallothamnus, commonly known as the coral thorned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, branching stems that form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
