It features long, arching stems covered with fleshy, ovate leaves that are often reddish at the base. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with flowers that are typically pink to red in color, often with a white or yellow throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media. Epidendrum carneum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
