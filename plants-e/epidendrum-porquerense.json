    "intro": "Epidendrum porquerense, commonly known as the Porquerense orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Epidendrum porquerense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
