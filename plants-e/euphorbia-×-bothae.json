    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 bothae, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia \u00d7 bothae is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
