    "intro": "Euonymus mitratus, commonly known as the Christmas box tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, box-like fruits that persist through winter. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping. Euonymus mitratus is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions."
