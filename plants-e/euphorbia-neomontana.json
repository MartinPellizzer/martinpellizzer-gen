    "intro": "Euphorbia neomontana, commonly known as the Alpine spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
