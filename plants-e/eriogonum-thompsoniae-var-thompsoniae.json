It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
