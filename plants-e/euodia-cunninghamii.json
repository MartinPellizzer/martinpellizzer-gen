    "intro": "Euodia cunninghamii, commonly known as the Australian prickly ash, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Euodia cunninghamii is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in Australian flora."
