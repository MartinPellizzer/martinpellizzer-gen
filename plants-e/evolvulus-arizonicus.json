It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
