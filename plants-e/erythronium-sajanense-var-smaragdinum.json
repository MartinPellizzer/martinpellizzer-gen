    "intro": "Erythronium sajanense var. smaragdinum, commonly known as the Sajan Emerald Trillium, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and produces a single, showy flower with three pale green petals and a distinctive yellow throat. The plant's flowers are often described as resembling a trillium, with a nodding appearance that adds to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
