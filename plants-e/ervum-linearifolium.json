    "intro": "Ervum linearifolium, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its linear, narrow leaves and small, pea-like flowers. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces pods that contain several small, elliptical seeds. Its root system fixes nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Ervum linearifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and hardiness."
