    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. llanuraensis, commonly known as the Llanura prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the U.S. state of Texas. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and can store water in its stems. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
