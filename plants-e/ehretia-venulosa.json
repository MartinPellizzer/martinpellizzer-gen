It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 5 to 15 meters. The plant features elliptical, glossy green leaves with a velvety texture on the underside, which gives it its common name. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are clustered in racemes. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds."
