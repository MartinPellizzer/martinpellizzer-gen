    "intro": "Elaeocarpus macrocerus, commonly known as the large-fruited elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces distinctive, woody, spherical fruits that are encased in a thick, leathery outer layer. These fruits contain several seeds and are adapted for dispersal by animals. Elaeocarpus macrocerus is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
