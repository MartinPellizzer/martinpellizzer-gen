    "intro": "Echium rosulatum, commonly known as the rosette echium, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense rosette of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Echium rosulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
