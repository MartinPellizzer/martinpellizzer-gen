It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and wet meadows. Epilobium \u00d7 langeanum is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
