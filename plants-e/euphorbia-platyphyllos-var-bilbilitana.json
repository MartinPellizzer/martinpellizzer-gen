    "intro": "Euphorbia platyphyllos var. bilbilitana, commonly known as the Bilbilitan euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its growth habit is compact, with a tendency to form dense, rounded clumps. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in dry, sunny conditions."
