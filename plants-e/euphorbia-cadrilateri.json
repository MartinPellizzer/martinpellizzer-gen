    "intro": "Euphorbia cadrilateri, commonly known as the four-cornered spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a distinctive four-cornered pattern, giving it its common name. Euphorbia cadrilateri is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
