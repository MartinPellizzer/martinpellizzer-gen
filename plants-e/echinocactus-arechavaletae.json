    "intro": "Echinocactus arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is well adapted to full sun exposure and requires minimal water once established."
