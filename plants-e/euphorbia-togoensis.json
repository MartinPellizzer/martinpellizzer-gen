    "intro": "Euphorbia togoensis, commonly known as the Togo spurge, is a succulent shrub native to West Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia togoensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
