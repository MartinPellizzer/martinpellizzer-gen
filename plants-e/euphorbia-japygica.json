    "intro": "Euphorbia japygica, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss. Euphorbia japygica is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
