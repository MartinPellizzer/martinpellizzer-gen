It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows at higher elevations, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its fruit, a small, round berry, is edible and has a tart, slightly sweet flavor. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
