    "intro": "Elatostema variolaminosum, commonly known as the variable-leaf elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often variegated, with a distinctive pattern of light and dark green, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers. Elatostema variolaminosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
