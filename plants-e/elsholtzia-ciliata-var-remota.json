    "intro": "Elsholtzia ciliata var. remota, commonly known as the remote cilial germander, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with ciliate margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its medicinal properties have been noted in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is used for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
