    "intro": "Evolvulus filipes var. gracillimus, commonly known as the slender stem morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are slender and often twining. This variant is distinguished by its more delicate appearance compared to other Evolvulus species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
