    "intro": "Euphorbia ritchiei subsp. marsabitensis, commonly known as the Marsabit euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, with a tendency to form dense clumps. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
