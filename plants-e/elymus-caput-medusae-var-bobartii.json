    "intro": "Elymus caput-medusae var. bobartii, commonly known as the \"Medusa-head grass,\" is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tufted inflorescence that resembles the crown of Medusa, with dense, spikelet-bearing branches. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showing a high degree of adaptation to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in open, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological resilience."
