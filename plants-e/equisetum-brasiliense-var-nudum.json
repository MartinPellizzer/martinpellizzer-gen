    "intro": "Equisetum brasiliense var. nudum, commonly known as the Brazilian horsetail, is a species of fern-like plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its primitive features, it provides valuable insights into the evolution of early vascular plants."
