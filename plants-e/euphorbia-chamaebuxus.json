    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaebuxus, commonly known as the low bush spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and small, green leaves. The plant produces yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
