    "intro": "Epithema carnosum, commonly known as the fleshy epidermis plant, is a unique species characterized by its thick, succulent leaves. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is native to arid regions of South America. The plant's foliage is covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Despite its resilience, it is relatively rare and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
