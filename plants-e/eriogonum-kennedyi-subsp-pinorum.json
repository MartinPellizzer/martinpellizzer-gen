    "intro": "Eriogonum kennedyi subsp. pinorum, commonly known as the Kennedy's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. Its leaves are generally narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in ecological restoration projects."
