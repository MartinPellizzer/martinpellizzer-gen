    "intro": "Eschweilera acuminata, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often found in the understory of humid, lowland forests. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape with a smooth surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
