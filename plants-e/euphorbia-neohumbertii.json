    "intro": "Euphorbia neohumbertii, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features striking, spiky, red-orange bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces a milky sap that can be irritating. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
