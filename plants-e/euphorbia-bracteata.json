    "intro": "Euphorbia bracteata, commonly known as the red-veined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia bracteata is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, which helps it survive in dry conditions."
