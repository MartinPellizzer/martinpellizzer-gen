    "intro": "Eriocaulon rigidum, commonly known as the rigid spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, grass-like stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes and are usually wind-pollinated, typical of many sedges."
