    "intro": "Eriocaulon brownianum var. nilagirense, commonly known as the Nilagiri marsh plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant thrives in wetland environments, particularly in the high-altitude regions of the Nilgiri Mountains in India. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil in its moist habitat. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphological features and is of interest to botanists studying aquatic and semi-aquatic flora."
