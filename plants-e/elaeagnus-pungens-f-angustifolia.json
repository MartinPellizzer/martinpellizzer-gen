    "intro": "Elaeagnus pungens f. angustifolia, commonly known as silverthorn, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-white, hair-like leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils. This variety is also valued for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
