    "intro": "Epidendrum trullichilum, commonly known as the Trullichilum Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Its unique floral structure and adaptability make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
