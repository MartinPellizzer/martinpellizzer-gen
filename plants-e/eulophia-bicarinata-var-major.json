    "intro": "Eulophia bicarinata var. major, commonly known as the giant eulophia, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This variant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, with a distinctive white or pale pink coloration. The plant features long, arching inflorescences and possesses a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Eulophia bicarinata var. major thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
