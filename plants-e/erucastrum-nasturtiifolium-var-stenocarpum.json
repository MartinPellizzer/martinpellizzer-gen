It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. The species is characterized by its peppery taste, which is due to the presence of glucosinolates."
