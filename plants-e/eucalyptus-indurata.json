    "intro": "Eucalyptus indurata, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a tall tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its flowers are small and white or pink, clustered in umbels, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Eucalyptus indurata is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian forests and woodlands."
