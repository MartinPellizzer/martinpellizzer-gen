    "intro": "Erucastrum ifniense, commonly known as the Ifni rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Erucastrum ifniense is considered a rare and endemic species."
