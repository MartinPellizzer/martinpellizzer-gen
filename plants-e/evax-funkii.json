    "intro": "Evax funkii, commonly known as the Funk's ghostplant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its evocative common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in the early morning, often before sunrise. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Evax funkii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts."
