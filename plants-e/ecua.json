    "intro": "Ecua, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that can range from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. Due to its unique beauty and ecological significance, the Ecua is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
