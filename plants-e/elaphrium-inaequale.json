    "intro": "Elaphrium inaequale, commonly known as the unequal elaphrium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in complex umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Elaphrium inaequale is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
