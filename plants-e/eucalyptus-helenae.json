    "intro": "Eucalyptus helenae, commonly known as the Helen's gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from grey to white in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-green hue when mature. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands."
