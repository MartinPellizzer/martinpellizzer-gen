It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience. Echinopsis manguinii prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
