    "intro": "Eritrichium tibeticum var. minor, commonly known as the Tibetan dwarf fleabane, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky and alpine habitats, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
