    "intro": "Eriogonum reniforme var. comosum, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
