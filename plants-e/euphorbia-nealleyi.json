    "intro": "Euphorbia nealleyi, commonly known as the Nealley's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Euphorbia nealleyi is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
