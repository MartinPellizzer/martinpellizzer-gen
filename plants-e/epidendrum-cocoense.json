    "intro": "Epidendrum cocoense, commonly known as the coconut orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, and it produces striking white or pale yellow blooms. Epidendrum cocoense is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
