    "intro": "Echinopsis rhodotricha var. robusta, commonly known as the robusta echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This variety is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
