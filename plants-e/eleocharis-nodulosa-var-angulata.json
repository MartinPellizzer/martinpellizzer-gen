    "intro": "Eleocharis nodulosa var. angulata, commonly known as the angular spike-rush, is a species of sedges native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems that are often ribbed and have a distinctive angular appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its morphology reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
