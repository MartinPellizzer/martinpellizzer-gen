    "intro": "Epidendrum pachyphyton, commonly known as the thick-leafed epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to drier environments. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers in a raceme, typically in shades of white, yellow, or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
