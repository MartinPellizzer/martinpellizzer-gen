    "intro": "Eriogonum mitophyllum, commonly known as the San Joaquin bursage, is a flowering plant native to California and Nevada. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, spiny fruits that serve as a food source for various wildlife species. Eriogonum mitophyllum is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub and desert habitats."
