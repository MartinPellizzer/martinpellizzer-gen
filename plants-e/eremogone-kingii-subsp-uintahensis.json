    "intro": "Eremogone kingii subsp. uintahensis, commonly known as the Uinta eremogone, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and cliffs, and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
