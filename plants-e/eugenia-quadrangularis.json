    "intro": "Eugenia quadrangularis, commonly known as the Surinam cherry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, cherry-like fruits. The fruits are typically harvested when fully ripe, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
