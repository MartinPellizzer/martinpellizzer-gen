    "intro": "Elemifera plumieri, commonly known as the Hawaiian silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces a single, tall stem that bears yellow-orange flowers, which bloom once in the plant's lifetime. It thrives in high-elevation areas with volcanic soil and requires specific microclimatic conditions. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
