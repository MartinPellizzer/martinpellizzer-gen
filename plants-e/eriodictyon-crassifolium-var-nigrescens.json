It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that turn black when dried, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer to early fall. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for its purported health benefits."
