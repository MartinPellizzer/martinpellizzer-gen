    "intro": "Epidendrum diffusum, commonly known as the wandering orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Epidendrum diffusum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and attractive, long-lasting blooms."
