    "intro": "Escobaria sneedii subsp. leei, commonly known as the Sneed's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and New Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant."
