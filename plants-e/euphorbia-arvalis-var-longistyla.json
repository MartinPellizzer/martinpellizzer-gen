    "intro": "Euphorbia arvalis var. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features simple, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
