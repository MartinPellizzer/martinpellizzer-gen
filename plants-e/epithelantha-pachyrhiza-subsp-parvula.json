    "intro": "Epithelantha pachyrhiza subsp. parvula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed barrel cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other varieties of Epithelantha pachyrhiza."
