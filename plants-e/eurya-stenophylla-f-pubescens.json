    "intro": "Eurya stenophylla f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent evergreen holly, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
