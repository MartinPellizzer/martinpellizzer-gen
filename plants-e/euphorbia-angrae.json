    "intro": "Euphorbia angrae, commonly known as the Angrae spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with minimal rainfall. Euphorbia angrae is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
