    "intro": "Epidendrum vellozoi, commonly known as the Vellozoi orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Epidendrum vellozoi is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
