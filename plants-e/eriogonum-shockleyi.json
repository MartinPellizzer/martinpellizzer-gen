It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its clustered inflorescences of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
