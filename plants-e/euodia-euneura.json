It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Euodia euneura is adapted to grow in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its hard, dense wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay."
