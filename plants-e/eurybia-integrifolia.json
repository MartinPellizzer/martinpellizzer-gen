    "intro": "Eurybia integrifolia, commonly known as New England Aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flower heads that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant features upright, branched stems covered with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. Its flowers are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eurybia integrifolia is often found in moist meadows, prairies, and woodland edges, and it plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems."
