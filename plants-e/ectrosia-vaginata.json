    "intro": "Ectrosia vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Ectrosia vaginata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
