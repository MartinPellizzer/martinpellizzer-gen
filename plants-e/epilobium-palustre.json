It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant features slender, often reddish stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy coating. It produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
