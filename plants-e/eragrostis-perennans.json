    "intro": "Eragrostis perennans, commonly known as perennial buffalo grass, is a low-growing, rhizomatous grass native to North America. It has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is often used in erosion control and as a decorative ground cover due to its dense, mat-forming growth habit. Its adaptability to various soil types and minimal maintenance requirements make it a valuable plant in arid and semi-arid regions."
