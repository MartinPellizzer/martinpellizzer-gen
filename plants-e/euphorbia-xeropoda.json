    "intro": "Euphorbia xeropoda, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, storing moisture in its leaves and stem. Euphorbia xeropoda is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
