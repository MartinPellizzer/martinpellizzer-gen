    "intro": "Eryngium angustifolium, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a basal rosette structure, which helps it survive in salty, windy environments. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. Eryngium angustifolium is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional herbal medicine."
