    "intro": "Ehrharta stipoides subsp. breviseta, commonly known as narrow-bristled lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
