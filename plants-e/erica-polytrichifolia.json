    "intro": "Erica polytrichifolia, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Erica polytrichifolia is well adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
