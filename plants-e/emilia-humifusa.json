    "intro": "Emilia humifusa, commonly known as the carpet flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features wiry, sprawling stems that form a dense mat of foliage, often reaching heights of only a few centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Emilia humifusa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
