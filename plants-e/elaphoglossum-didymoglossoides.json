    "intro": "Elaphoglossum didymoglossoides, commonly known as the twin-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of pale, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a feature common among ferns in this genus."
