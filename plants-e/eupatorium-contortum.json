    "intro": "Eupatorium contortum, commonly known as black snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and have a distinctive, bitter taste. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory properties."
