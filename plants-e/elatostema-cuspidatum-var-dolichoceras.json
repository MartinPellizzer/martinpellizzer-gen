    "intro": "Elatostema cuspidatum var. dolichoceras, commonly known as the slender-tipped elatostema, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of East Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and adaptation to humid conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
