    "intro": "Eurya japonica var. boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin eurya, is a shrub native to the Bonin Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to specific island ecosystems."
