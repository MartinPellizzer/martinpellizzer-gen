    "intro": "Epallage humifusa, commonly known as the groundsel or false dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated gardens."
