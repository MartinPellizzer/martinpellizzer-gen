It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a hairy underside. The inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-ranked spikelets. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.
