    "intro": "Euphorbia hyberna var. monantha, commonly known as the Irish spurge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces unique, cup-like structures called cyathia, which contain the actual flowers and are surrounded by modified leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Euphorbia hyberna var. monantha is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
