    "intro": "Eucalyptus ferriticola, commonly known as the ironbark gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its rugged, iron-like bark that gives it its common name, and it often grows in dense, humid environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically dull green and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, creamy-white flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, and its timber is valued for its strength and durability. Eucalyptus ferriticola plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various native wildlife species."
