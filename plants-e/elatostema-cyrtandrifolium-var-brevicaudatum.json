    "intro": "Elatostema cyrtandrifolium var. brevicaudatum, commonly known as the narrow-tailed elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are often succulent, adapted to retain moisture in humid conditions. The species is part of the Urticaceae family, known for its stinging hairs, though this particular variety is generally less irritating."
