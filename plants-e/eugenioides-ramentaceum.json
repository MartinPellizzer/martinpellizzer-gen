It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by edible, red berries. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its common name. Eugenioides ramentaceum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
