    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pangoanum, commonly known as the Pangoanum holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into a bipinnate structure. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in tropical ecosystems."
