    "intro": "Euphorbia gerardiana var. firma, commonly known as the firm-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a characteristic common in many euphorbias for deterring herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
