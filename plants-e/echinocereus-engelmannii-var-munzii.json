    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii var. munzii, commonly known as the Munz's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that often branch near the base, forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne at the areoles along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
