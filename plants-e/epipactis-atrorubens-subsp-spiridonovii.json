    "intro": "Epipactis atrorubens subsp. spiridonovii, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which is an adaptation to its high-altitude environment. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
