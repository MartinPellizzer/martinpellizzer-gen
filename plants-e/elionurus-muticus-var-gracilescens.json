    "intro": "Elionurus muticus var. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a grass species native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, wiry blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The species is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
