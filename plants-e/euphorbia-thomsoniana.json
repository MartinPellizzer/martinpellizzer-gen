    "intro": "Euphorbia thomsoniana, commonly known as the Thomson's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia thomsoniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
