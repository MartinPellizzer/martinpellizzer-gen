It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny leaves and showy, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and sunny habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The f. albiflorum form is distinguished by its notably white flowers, contrasting with the more commonly purple-flowered variety of Echium vulgare."
