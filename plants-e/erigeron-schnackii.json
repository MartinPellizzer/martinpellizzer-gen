    "intro": "Erigeron schnackii, commonly known as the Sierra dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has finely divided, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are yellow with white ray florets, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Erigeron schnackii is often used in wildflower gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
