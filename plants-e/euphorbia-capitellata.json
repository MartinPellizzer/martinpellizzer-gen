It features a short, woody stem with dense clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flowers typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
