    "intro": "Elymus hystrix, commonly known as the prickly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has sharp, bristle-like awns on its seeds, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, open habitats. Elymus hystrix is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
