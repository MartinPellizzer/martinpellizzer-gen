    "intro": "Erica kingaensis subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the Kingaensis heath, is a shrub native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically evergreen. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to coastal and Mediterranean climates."
