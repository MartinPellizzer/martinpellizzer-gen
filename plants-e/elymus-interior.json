    "intro": "Elymus interior, commonly known as the inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus interior is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
