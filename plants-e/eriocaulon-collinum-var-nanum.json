    "intro": "Eriocaulon collinum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf hill marsh sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in marshy areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for microinvertebrates."
