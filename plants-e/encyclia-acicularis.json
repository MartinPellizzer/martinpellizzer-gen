    "intro": "Encyclia acicularis, commonly known as the needle orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and ecological adaptability in its native habitat."
