    "intro": "Eupatorium stachyophyllum, commonly known as the white eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are white to pale blue and are arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters. Eupatorium stachyophyllum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
