    "intro": "Elymus thoroldianus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a prominent midrib. Elymus thoroldianus is often found in open areas, such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is valued for its erosion control and forage qualities."
