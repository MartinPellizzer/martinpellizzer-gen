    "intro": "Eria pendula, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Eria pendula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
