    "intro": "Encyclia maravalensis, commonly known as the Maraval orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, specifically found in countries like Cuba and the Bahamas. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, and it is adapted to withstand periods of drought. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
