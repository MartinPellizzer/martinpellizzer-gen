    "intro": "Eupatorium malachophyllum, commonly known as the purple stem false dragonhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are often purple-tinged, and its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
