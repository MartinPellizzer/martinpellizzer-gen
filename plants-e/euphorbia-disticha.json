    "intro": "Euphorbia disticha, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that are covered in small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often mistaken for blooms. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
