    "intro": "Euphorbia gladiata, commonly known as the swordleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
