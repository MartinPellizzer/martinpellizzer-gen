    "intro": "Eremophila clavata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Emu Bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it well-suited for dry environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Eremophila clavata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
