    "intro": "Erythrophleum africanum f. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth African ebony, is a variant of the African ebony tree native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dark, dense wood and smooth, glabrous bark. The plant has pinnate leaves with 7 to 13 pairs of leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, oblong seeds. This subspecies is valued for its hard, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts within its native habitat."
