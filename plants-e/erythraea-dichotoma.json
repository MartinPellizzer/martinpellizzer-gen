    "intro": "Erythraea dichotoma, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, with two main stems emerging from the base, giving it a unique appearance. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, reddish color and is used in traditional craftsmanship and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
