    "intro": "Elytrigia reflexiaristata, commonly known as the reflexed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
