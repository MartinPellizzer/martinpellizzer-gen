    "intro": "Ericoides nutans, commonly known as the nodding heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its flowers, which are typically pink or white, bloom in late spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ericoides nutans is an important component of coastal scrub ecosystems and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
