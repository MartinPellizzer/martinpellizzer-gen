    "intro": "Euonymus calocarpus, commonly known as the red-spotted maple or red maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red or orange foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are alternate, simple, and usually ovate with serrated edges. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. The plant is relatively easy to grow and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
