    "intro": "Eria piruensis, commonly known as the Piru orchid, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow blooms that are clustered in racemes. Eria piruensis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
