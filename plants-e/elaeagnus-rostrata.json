    "intro": "Elaeagnus rostrata, commonly known as the silver leaf buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and dry forests. Elaeagnus rostrata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation."
