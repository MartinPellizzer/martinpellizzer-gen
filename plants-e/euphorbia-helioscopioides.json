    "intro": "Euphorbia helioscopioides, commonly known as the sunspider or sun scorpion, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered in a waxy, blue-gray cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for drought survival. Due to its spiny texture and toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
