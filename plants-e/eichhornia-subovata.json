    "intro": "Eichhornia subovata, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually lavender to pink in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in non-native regions."
