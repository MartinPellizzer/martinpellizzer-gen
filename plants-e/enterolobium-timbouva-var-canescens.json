It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value and potential for erosion control make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
