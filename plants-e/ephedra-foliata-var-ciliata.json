    "intro": "Ephedra foliata var. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine, ciliate hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in compact inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Ephedra foliata var. ciliata is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its use is now largely restricted due to legal and safety concerns."
