    "intro": "Epidendrum vannerianum, commonly known as the Yellow Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
