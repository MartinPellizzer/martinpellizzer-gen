    "intro": "Euphorbia nitens, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem covered in dense, silver-gray hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
