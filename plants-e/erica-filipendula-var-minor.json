    "intro": "Erica filipendula var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
