    "intro": "Eremostachys sanguinea var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf red sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with limited water resources."
