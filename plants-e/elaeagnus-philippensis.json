It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its fragrant, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Elaeagnus philippensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
