    "intro": "Epimedium \u00d7 rubrum, commonly known as the Chinese barrenwort, is a hybrid evergreen perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that remains green throughout the year. The plant produces striking red to orange flowers in early spring, which appear before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate shade and its long-lasting foliage."
