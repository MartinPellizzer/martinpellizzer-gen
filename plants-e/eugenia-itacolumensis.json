    "intro": "Eugenia itacolumensis, commonly known as the Itacolumi guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for fruit production, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
