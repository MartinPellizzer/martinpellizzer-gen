    "intro": "Epidendrum dunstervillei, commonly known as the Dunsterville's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, with a glossy surface that helps in capturing moisture from the air. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
