    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus var. coccineus, commonly known as the red-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and produces bright red flowers during the summer months. The plant has spines that are typically yellow or orange, and it thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and birds."
