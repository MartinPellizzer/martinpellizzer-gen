    "intro": "Erophila hirta, commonly known as sticky everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Erophila hirta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers."
