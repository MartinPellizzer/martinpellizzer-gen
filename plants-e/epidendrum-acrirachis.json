    "intro": "Epidendrum acrirachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting mix to prevent root rot. Epidendrum acrirachis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
