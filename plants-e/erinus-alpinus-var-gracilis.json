It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for alpine gardens and container planting."
