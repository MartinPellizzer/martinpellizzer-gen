    "intro": "Elymus violaceus subsp. andinus, commonly known as the Andean wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often turn reddish in dry conditions. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets that are typically pale green to purplish in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and as a forage crop in high-altitude regions."
