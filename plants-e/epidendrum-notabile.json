    "intro": "Epidendrum notabile, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, red, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Epidendrum notabile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
