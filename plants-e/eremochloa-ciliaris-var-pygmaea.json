    "intro": "Eremochloa ciliaris var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to regions of Africa, particularly in southern and eastern areas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, pale green to silver-blue flowers that appear in late summer or early autumn. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, attractive mats."
