    "intro": "Elatostema lineolatum var. lineolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elatostema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features small, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, often with a distinctive midrib. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the warm seasons. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and wetlands, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
