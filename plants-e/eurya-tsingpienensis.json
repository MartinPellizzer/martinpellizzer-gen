    "intro": "Eurya tsingpienensis, commonly known as the Tsingpien evergreen holly, is a shrub or small tree native to China, particularly in the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
