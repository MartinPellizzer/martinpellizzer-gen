    "intro": "Englerodendron gabunense, commonly known as the Gabon mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction, though its harvesting is now regulated due to conservation concerns."
