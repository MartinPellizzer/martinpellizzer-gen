    "intro": "Euphorbia viminea f. castellana, commonly known as the Castellana spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features elongated, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. This ornamental plant is valued for its unique appearance and ability to tolerate harsh, dry conditions."
