It features broad, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to retain moisture. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Epidendrum mooreanum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
