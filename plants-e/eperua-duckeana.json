    "intro": "Eperua duckeana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its dense, dark wood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and musical instrument industries. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
