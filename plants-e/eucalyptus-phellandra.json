    "intro": "Eucalyptus phellandra, commonly known as lemon-scented gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and peels off in thin layers, a common feature among many eucalyptus species. Eucalyptus phellandra is also valued for its essential oils, which have various industrial and therapeutic applications."
