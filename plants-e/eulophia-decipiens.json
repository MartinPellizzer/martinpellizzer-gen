    "intro": "Eulophia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It possesses long, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded forest environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns that mimic other orchid species, a trait that may aid in pollination. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Eulophia decipiens thrives in humid, well-drained conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
