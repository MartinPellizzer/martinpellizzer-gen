    "intro": "Eucalyptus diversifolia subsp. hesperia, commonly known as the Esperanza eucalyptus, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually blue-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. The subspecies is notable for its aromatic oils, which contribute to its use in traditional and modern herbal applications."
