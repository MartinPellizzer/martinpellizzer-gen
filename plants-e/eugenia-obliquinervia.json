    "intro": "Eugenia obliquinervia, commonly known as the oblique-veined eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its ovate to elliptical leaves with oblique venation patterns, which give it its scientific name. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible. Eugenia obliquinervia is often found in secondary forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
