    "intro": "Echinocereus roemeri, commonly known as the Fisher's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines, which provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Echinocereus roemeri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
