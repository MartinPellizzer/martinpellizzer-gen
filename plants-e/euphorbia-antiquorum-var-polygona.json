    "intro": "Euphorbia antiquorum var. polygona, commonly known as the ancient euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in a layer of white, waxy sap, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
