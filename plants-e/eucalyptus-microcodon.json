    "intro": "Eucalyptus microcodon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form. The plant produces small, globular flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Eucalyptus microcodon is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient shrub in harsh climates."
