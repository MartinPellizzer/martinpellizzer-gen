    "intro": "Eugenia ochracea, commonly known as the yellow eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, dark blue to black berries. Eugenia ochracea is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
