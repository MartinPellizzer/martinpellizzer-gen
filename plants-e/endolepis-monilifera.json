    "intro": "Endolepis monilifera, commonly known as the bead-leaved fig, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, bead-like leaves that are clustered at the ends of the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, spherical fruits that are often consumed by local communities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and nutritional benefits, it is also cultivated in some parts of the world for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
