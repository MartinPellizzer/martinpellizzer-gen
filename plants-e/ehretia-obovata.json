    "intro": "Ehretia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate ehretia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, obovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
