It features grass-like foliage with narrow, grass-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
