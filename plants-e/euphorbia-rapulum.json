    "intro": "Euphorbia rapulum, commonly known as the small-spurred euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous small, green, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
