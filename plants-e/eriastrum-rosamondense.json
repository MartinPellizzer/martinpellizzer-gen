It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow to reddish-brown flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid environments with limited water availability."
