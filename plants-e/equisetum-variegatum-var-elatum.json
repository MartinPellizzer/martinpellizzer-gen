It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing spore-producing cones at the tips. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its distinctive appearance and its role in historical and ecological contexts."
