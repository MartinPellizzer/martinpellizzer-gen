    "intro": "Eulophia tuberifera, commonly known as the tuberous eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant forms tubers underground, which help it survive periods of drought and dormancy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
