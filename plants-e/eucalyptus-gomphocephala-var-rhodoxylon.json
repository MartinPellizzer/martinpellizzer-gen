    "intro": "Eucalyptus gomphocephala var. rhodoxylon, commonly known as the red gum, is a species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and smooth, reddish-barked trunk that peels away as the tree matures. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often grey-green in color, while the flowers are small, white or pale blue, and clustered in umbels. This plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It is also valued for its aromatic timber and has been used traditionally by Indigenous communities."
