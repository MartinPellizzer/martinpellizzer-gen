It is characterized by its distinctive spherical blue or purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
