It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland and shrubland habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally in some African cultures for its potential health benefits."
