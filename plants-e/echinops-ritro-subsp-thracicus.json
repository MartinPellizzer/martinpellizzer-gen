    "intro": "Echinops ritro subsp. thracicus, commonly known as the Thrace thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by the distinctive, spiky bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open landscapes such as grasslands and steppe environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other Echinops species."
