    "intro": "Eucalyptus helmsii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus helmsii is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in horticulture for its drought tolerance and aromatic properties."
