It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are often blue or violet in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.
