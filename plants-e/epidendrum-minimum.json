    "intro": "Epidendrum minimum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a small, compact plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, clustered flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Epidendrum minimum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and delicate appearance."
