It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, with prominent veins that give it its scientific name. Esterhazya nervosa thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
