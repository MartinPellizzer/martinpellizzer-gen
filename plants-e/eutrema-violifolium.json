    "intro": "Eutrema violifolium, commonly known as the coastal bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas, exhibiting adaptations to salty and windy conditions. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss."
