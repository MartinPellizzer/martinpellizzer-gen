    "intro": "Encyclia oxyphylla, commonly known as the Mexican sun orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Encyclia oxyphylla thrives in sunny, well-drained environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and tropical landscapes."
