It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has spiny areoles and produces small, rounded fruits that are typically red or orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
