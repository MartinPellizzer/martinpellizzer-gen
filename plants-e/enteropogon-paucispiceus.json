It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown and lack the showy petals typical of many flowering plants. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
