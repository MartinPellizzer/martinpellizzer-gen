    "intro": "Exacum amplexifolium, commonly known as the ivy-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, fleshy leaves that often wrap around its stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is widely cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
