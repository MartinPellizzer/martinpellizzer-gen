    "intro": "Elisma natans subvar. plantaginifolium, commonly known as the water parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, often floating stems that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This subvariety is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams, contributing to aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
