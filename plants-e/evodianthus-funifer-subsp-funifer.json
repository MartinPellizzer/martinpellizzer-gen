    "intro": "Evodianthus funifer subsp. funifer, commonly known as the narrowleaf evodianthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
