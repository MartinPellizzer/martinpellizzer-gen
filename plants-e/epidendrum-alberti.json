    "intro": "Epidendrum alberti, commonly known as the Albert's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that bear clusters of bright orange or red flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Epidendrum alberti is valued in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
