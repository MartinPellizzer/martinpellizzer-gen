    "intro": "Epidendrum chiguindense, commonly known as the Chiguind\u00e9 orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, velvety texture, enhancing its ornamental appeal. Epidendrum chiguindense is valued in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
