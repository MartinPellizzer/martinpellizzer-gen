    "intro": "Effusiella henrique-aragonii, commonly known as the Henry-Aragon fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing soruses located on the undersides of its fronds, typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
