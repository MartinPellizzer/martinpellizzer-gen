    "intro": "Erodium triviale, commonly known as common stork's bill, is a small annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm and has small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright pink or red flowers with a distinctive beak-like spur, which gives it its common name. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Erodium triviale is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
