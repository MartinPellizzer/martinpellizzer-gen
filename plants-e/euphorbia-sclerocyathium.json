    "intro": "Euphorbia sclerocyathium, commonly known as the rigid cup euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, segmented stem with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts, giving it a striking appearance. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Euphorbia sclerocyathium is a slow-growing species that requires minimal water and full sun to flourish."
