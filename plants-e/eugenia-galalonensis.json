    "intro": "Eugenia galalonensis, commonly known as the Galalonensis guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
