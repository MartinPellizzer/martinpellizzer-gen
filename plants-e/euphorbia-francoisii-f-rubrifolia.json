    "intro": "Euphorbia francoisii f. rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leafed African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking red-tinged leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant."
