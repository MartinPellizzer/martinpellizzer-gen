    "intro": "Erophila verna subsp. obconica, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in calcareous soils, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features a slender stem with oval, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of violet to purple flowers in early spring. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is often marked with darker pigments, aiding in pollination by bees and other insects. The subspecies obconica is distinguished by its more upright growth habit and slightly broader leaves compared to the typical form of E. verna."
