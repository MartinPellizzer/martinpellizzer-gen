    "intro": "Erodium jacquinianum proles sabulicola, commonly known as the sand erodium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
