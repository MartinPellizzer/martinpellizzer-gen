    "intro": "Eleocharis flaccida var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often concealed within dense, leafy foliage. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms. Its morphology is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with rhizomes that aid in vegetative propagation."
