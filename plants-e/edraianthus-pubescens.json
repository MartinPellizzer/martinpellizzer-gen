It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
