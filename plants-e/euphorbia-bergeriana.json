    "intro": "Euphorbia bergeriana, commonly known as the Berger's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems and sparse, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to conserve water. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
