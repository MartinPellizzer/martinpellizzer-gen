    "intro": "Eugenia leandriana, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is noted for its ornamental value, particularly due to its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Eugenia leandriana is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant for its aesthetic appeal and mild fragrance."
