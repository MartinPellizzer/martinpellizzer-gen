It features upright, branching stems that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
