    "intro": "Empusa paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet scent that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of flies. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Empusa paradoxa is considered a vulnerable species."
