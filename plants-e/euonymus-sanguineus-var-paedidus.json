It is characterized by its striking foliage, with young leaves having a distinctive red margin that fades as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to reveal bright red seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The species is relatively hardy and adaptable, making it a popular choice for hedges and ground cover."
