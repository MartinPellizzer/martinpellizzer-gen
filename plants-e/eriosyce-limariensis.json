    "intro": "Eriosyce limariensis, commonly known as the Limari rock cactus, is a species of cactus native to Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, where it is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale green, appearing in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
