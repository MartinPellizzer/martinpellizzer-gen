    "intro": "Erica guthriei var. strictior, commonly known as the narrowleaf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
