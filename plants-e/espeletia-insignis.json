    "intro": "Espeletia insignis, commonly known as the \"Puya raimondii\" or the \"Queen of the Andes,\" is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. Espeletia insignis thrives in cool, humid climates and is adapted to the extreme conditions of the Andean highlands. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in the region's flora."
