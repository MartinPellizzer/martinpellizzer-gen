    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii var. armatus, commonly known as the armed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, typically growing to a height of 10 to 20 inches. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is particularly notable for its lack of spines, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and container gardening."
