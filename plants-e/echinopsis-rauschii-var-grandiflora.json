It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
