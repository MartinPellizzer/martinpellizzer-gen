    "intro": "Eucalyptus ovata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a silvery underside. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland and forest environments."
