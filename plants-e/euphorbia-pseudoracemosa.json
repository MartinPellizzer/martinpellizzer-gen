    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudoracemosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features stout, cylindrical stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water evaporation. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well adapted to desert conditions."
