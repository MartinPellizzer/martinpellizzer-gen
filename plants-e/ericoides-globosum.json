    "intro": "Ericoides globosum, commonly known as the globular ericoid, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth form and leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Ericoides globosum is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments. It is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
