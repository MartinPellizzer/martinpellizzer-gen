It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, spherical flower buds that are typically pink or red in color. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin layers, revealing a mottled appearance. Eucalyptus sparsifolia is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in woodland and heathland habitats."
