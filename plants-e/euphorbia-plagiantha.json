    "intro": "Euphorbia plagiantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia plagiantha is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
