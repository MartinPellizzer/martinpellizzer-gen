    "intro": "[WRONG START] Embilia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan embelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the lowland rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other aromatic plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Embelia papuana is noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its uses."
