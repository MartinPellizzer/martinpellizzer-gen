    "intro": "Eriosema glomeratum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed eriosema, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in shrubland or grassland environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
