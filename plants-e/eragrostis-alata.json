    "intro": "Eragrostis alata, commonly known as the winged grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive awned lemmas that are often winged, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Eragrostis alata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
