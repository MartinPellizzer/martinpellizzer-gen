    "intro": "Ecbolium esenbeckii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Ecbolium esenbeckii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats."
