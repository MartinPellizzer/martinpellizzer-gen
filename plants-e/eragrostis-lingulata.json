    "intro": "Eragrostis lingulata, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed flowers. Eragrostis lingulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
