    "intro": "Elymus philadelphicus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hirsute wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along its stems, and it typically blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control."
