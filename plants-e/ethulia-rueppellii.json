It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system. It is often found in sandy soils and is a component of desert ecosystems. Ethulia rueppellii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
