    "intro": "Euphrasia curta, commonly known as the short euphrasia, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has a short life cycle and is often considered a hemiparasitic species, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants. Euphrasia curta is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
