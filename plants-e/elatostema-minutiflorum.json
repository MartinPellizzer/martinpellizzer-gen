    "intro": "Elatostema minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often overlooked due to their size. Elatostema minutiflorum is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a suitable candidate for shady garden spaces."
