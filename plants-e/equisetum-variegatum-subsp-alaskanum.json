    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum subsp. alaskanum, commonly known as the Alaska horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems that are typically bright green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are clustered in whorls. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. This subspecies is notable for its primitive features and is considered a relict from ancient plant lineages."
