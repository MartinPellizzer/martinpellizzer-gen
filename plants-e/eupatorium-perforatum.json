    "intro": "Eupatorium perforatum, commonly known as boneset, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive perforated appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Boneset is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported fever-reducing properties."
