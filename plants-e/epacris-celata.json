    "intro": "Epacris celata, commonly known as the pink epacris, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the heath family, Ericaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring and summer, producing vibrant pink to purple hues that attract nectar-feeding insects. Epacris celata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
