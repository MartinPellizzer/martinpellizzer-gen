    "intro": "Eusteralis griffithii, commonly known as the Kashmir snow lotus, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, snow-white flowers and hairy, silver-green foliage adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant thrives in rocky and arctic conditions, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
