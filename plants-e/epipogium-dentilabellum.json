    "intro": "Epipogium dentilabellum, commonly known as the toothed hooded orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal symbiosis for nutrition. The plant produces a single, hooded flower with a distinctive, toothed lip that gives it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with specific fungal networks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
