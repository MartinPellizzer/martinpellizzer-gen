It is characterized by its small, green leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
