    "intro": "Ervum lenticula var. leuocarpum, commonly known as the white-capsulated vetch, is a variant of the common vetch species. It is characterized by its pale or white seed pods, which distinguish it from the typical green pods of the standard variety. The plant is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and features trifoliate leaves with small, stipulate leaflets. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as fields and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it notable for both its ornamental value and its role in soil nitrogen fixation."
