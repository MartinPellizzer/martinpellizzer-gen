    "intro": "Eriogonum corymbosum var. davidsei, commonly known as the David's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments."
