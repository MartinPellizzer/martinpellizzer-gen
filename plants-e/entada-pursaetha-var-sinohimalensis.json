    "intro": "Entada pursaetha var. sinohimalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan cow-itch tree, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a spreading crown. The leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and the flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is valued for its timber and has traditional uses in local medicine."
