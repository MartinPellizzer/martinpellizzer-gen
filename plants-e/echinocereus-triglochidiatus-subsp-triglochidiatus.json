    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus subsp. triglochidiatus, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, typically at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient desert plant."
