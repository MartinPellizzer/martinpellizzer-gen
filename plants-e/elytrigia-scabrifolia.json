    "intro": "Elytrigia scabrifolia, commonly known as roughleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually terminal and often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Elytrigia scabrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
