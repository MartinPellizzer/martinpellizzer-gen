    "intro": "Esenbeckia grandiflora var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian esenbeckia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its ornamental value has led to its use in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in commercial trade."
