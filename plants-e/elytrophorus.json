    "intro": "Elytrophorus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. Its seeds are encased in a hard, fibrous capsule, which aids in their dispersal. Elytrophorus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
