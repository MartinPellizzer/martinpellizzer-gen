    "intro": "Euphorbia elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic flowering structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
