    "intro": "Elaeagnus glabra subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as silver leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Elaeagnus glabra subsp. crassifolia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
