    "intro": "Euphorbia umbonata, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, spiny stem with a swollen base that resembles a horn, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster known as a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. Euphorbia umbonata is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
