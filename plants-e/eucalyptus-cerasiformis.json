It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale blue, clustered in dense groups. The tree produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, brown seeds."
