    "intro": "Eleusine flagellifera, commonly known as the silky fingergrass, is a tropical annual grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions."
