    "intro": "Eucalyptus blakelyi, commonly known as the white box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are typically white or cream in color, which are followed by woody capsules containing the seeds. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a rough texture. Eucalyptus blakelyi is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
