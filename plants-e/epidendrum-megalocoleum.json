It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, making it one of the largest orchids in the genus. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
