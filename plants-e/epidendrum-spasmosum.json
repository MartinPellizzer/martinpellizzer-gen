    "intro": "Epidendrum spasmosum, commonly known as the Shaking Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy stems and clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique name refers to the way its stems shake or tremble in the wind. Epidendrum spasmosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in suitable conditions."
