    "intro": "Echinops buhaitensis, commonly known as the Buhaitan thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which are composed of tightly packed bracts. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, woody fruiting bodies. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Echinops buhaitensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals."
