    "intro": "Empleuridium, commonly known as the \"sugar maple\" or \"maple tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae. It is characterized by its alternate, palmately lobed leaves and the production of samaras, which are winged seeds. The genus includes several species, with Acer saccharum being the most well-known for its sap used in maple syrup production. Empleuridium species are typically found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They play an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
