    "intro": "Encyclia papillosa, commonly known as the hairy pterostylis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hairy appearance on the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and decaying organic matter. Encyclia papillosa is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
