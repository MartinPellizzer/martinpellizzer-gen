    "intro": "Eriogonum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often found in areas with limestone substrates. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum calcareum is an important component of its ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects and small animals."
