    "intro": "Eriocephalus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Eriocephalus glandulosus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
