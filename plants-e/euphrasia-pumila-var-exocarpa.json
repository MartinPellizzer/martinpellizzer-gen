    "intro": "Euphrasia pumila var. exocarpa, commonly known as the small yellow evening-primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have five petals and are often visited by insects. This variety is distinguished by its exocarp, which is thickened and contributes to its unique appearance."
