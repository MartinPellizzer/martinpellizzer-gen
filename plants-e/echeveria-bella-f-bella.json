It features vibrant, fleshy leaves that are typically pink to purple in color, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces tall, branching flower stalks that bear clusters of star-shaped, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its coloration. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container gardening."
