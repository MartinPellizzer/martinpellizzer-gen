    "intro": "Eulophus texanus, commonly known as the Texas lacewing, is a species of tiny parasitic wasp found primarily in the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Eulophidae and is characterized by its slender body and distinctive, lace-like wings. The plant aspect of this species is not applicable, as it is an insect, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical features to describe. I can't reply."
