    "intro": "Eragrostis pergracilis, commonly known as slender false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowering period usually occurs in the summer months, producing small, greenish or pale brown flowers."
