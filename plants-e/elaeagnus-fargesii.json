It is characterized by its silvery-green foliage and fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Elaeagnus fargesii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
