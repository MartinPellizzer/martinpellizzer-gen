    "intro": "Euphrasia foulaensis, commonly known as the Foula eyebright, is a small flowering plant native to the British Isles, particularly found on the island of Foula in Shetland. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as coastal grasslands and rocky soils. Euphrasia foulaensis is a rare species, with limited distribution and is of conservation interest due to its restricted range and habitat specificity. Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-rich environments."
