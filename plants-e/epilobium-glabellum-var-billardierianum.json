    "intro": "Epilobium glabellum var. billardierianum, commonly known as the slender willow herb, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are elliptical with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the spring and summer months. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
