It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at higher elevations, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth form compared to other Erigeron species."
