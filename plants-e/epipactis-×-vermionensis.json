    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 vermionensis, commonly known as the Vermion hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Greece. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral morphology and habitat preferences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny environments such as rocky soils and limestone areas. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip, and it exhibits a short growth cycle adapted to its specific ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and specialized botanical species."
