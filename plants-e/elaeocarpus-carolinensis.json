    "intro": "Elaeocarpus carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina elaeocarpus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, clustered white flowers. The tree's fruit is a woody, spherical capsule that contains several seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal hammocks and swamps. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
