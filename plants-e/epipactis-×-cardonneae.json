    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 cardonneae, commonly known as the Cardonne hybrid, is a rare orchid species resulting from the cross between Epipactis helleborine and Epipactis papaveracea. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive lip. This hybrid is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Italy and France. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid, offering insights into the genetic diversity and adaptive potential of orchids."
