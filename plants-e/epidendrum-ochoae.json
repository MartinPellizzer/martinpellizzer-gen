    "intro": "Epidendrum ochoae, commonly known as the Ochoa's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern. Epidendrum ochoae thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light."
