    "intro": "Esterhuysenia, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their small, yellow flowers and compound leaves with stipules. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Esterhuysenia species are sometimes used in traditional medicine and for their hardy, drought-resistant properties."
