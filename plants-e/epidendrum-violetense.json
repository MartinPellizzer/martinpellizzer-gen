    "intro": "Epidendrum violetense, commonly known as the Violet Orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flower spikes that often bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. The flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
