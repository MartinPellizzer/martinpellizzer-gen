    "intro": "Euphorbia engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a white, powdery coating called bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
