    "intro": "Encholirium avacanoeirum, commonly known as the Andean torch cactus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, often adorned with spines and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in cool, arid environments with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
