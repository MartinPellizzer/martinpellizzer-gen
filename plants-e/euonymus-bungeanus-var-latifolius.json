    "intro": "Euonymus bungeanus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, including China and Korea. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other euonymus species."
