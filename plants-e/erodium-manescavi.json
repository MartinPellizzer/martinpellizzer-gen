    "intro": "Erodium manescavi, commonly known as the narrowleaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a hairy texture, and it has a branched stem that is often prostrate or ascending. The seeds are small and capsule-like, dispersing easily by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
