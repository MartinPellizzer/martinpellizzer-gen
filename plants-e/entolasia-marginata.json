    "intro": "Entolasia marginata, commonly known as the marginate entolasia, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Entolasia marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
