    "intro": "Erucago erucago, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple, plum-like berries. These berries are rich in sugars and have been used historically in winemaking and as a source of dye. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
