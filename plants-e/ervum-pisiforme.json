    "intro": "Ervum pisiforme, commonly known as the broad bean or fava bean, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and the plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The seeds are rich in protein and have been cultivated for thousands of years as a food source."
