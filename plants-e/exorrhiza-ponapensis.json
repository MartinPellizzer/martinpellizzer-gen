    "intro": "Exorrhiza ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponape root vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caroline Islands. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and woody stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its roots are notable for their exorrhizal structure, which allows for the formation of mycorrhizal associations with fungi. This adaptation helps the plant thrive in nutrient-poor soils typical of its coastal habitat."
