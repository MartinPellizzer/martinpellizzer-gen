    "intro": "Euphorbia serrata f. ternata, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of many succulents. The leaves are narrow, serrated, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
