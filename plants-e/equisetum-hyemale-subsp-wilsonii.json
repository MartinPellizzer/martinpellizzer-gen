    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale subsp. wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, segmented stems and whorled leaves. It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, often calcareous soils, and it is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its stems are hollow and jointed, and they produce spores rather than flowers, making it a primitive vascular plant. The species is also recognized for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica."
