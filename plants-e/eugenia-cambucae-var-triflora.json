    "intro": "Eugenia cambucae var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered eugenia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically pink or white, arranged in clusters of three, giving it its common name. The fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a dark purple color and is edible, though often used in local traditional medicine."
