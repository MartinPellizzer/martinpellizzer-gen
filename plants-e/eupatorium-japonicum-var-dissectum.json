    "intro": "Eupatorium japonicum var. dissectum, commonly known as Japanese eupatorium or dissected Japanese boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to Japan. It features finely cut, fern-like foliage that gives it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
