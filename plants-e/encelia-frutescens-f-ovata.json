    "intro": "Encelia frutescens f. ovata, commonly known as the woolly bluecurls, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping in dry climates. The subspecies f. ovata is distinguished by its more rounded, ovate leaves compared to the typical form of E. frutescens."
