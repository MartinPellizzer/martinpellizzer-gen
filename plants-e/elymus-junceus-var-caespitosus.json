    "intro": "Elymus junceus var. caespitosus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in arid environments. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
