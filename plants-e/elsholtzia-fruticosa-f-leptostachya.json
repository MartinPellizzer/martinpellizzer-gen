It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or low shrubs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in spikes along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
