    "intro": "Ecballium agreste, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces spiky, spherical fruits that contain seeds with hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Ecballium agreste is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
