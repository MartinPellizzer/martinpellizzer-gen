    "intro": "Ephemeropteris palmensis, commonly known as the palm fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that resemble the shape of a palm tree, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ephemeropteris palmensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
