    "intro": "Eragrostis olmedoi, commonly known as the Olmedo grass, is a species of annual grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny grains of seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Eragrostis olmedoi is adapted to withstand drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
