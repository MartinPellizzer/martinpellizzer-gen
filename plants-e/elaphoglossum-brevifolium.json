    "intro": "Elaphoglossum brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
