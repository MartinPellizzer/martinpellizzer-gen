    "intro": "Eucalyptus educta, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, globular yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
