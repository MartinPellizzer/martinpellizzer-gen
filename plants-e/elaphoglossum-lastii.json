    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lastii, commonly known as the Last's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Elaphoglossum lastii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
