    "intro": "Eriogonum elatum subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced hair coverage compared to other varieties of Eriogonum elatum."
