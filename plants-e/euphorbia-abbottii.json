    "intro": "Euphorbia abbottii, commonly known as Abbott's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, woody stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has succulent-like leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Euphorbia abbottii is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
