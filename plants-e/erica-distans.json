    "intro": "Erica distans, commonly known as the distant heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in spring. Erica distans is evergreen, with dense, needle-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
