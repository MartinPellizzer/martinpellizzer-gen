    "intro": "Evaiezoa venosa, commonly known as the veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with prominent veins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas where suitable host trees are present. Its ecological role includes providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
