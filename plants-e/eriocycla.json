    "intro": "Eriocycla, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often blue or violet, ray florets that surround a central disk of smaller flowers. Eriocycla species typically grow in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. Their leaves are usually finely divided and aromatic, resembling those of other members of the carrot family. The genus includes several species, such as Eriocycla sinensis, which is native to Asia and used in traditional medicine."
