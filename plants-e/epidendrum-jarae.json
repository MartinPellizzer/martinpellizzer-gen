    "intro": "Epidendrum jarae, commonly known as the Jara's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum jarae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate for orchid enthusiasts."
