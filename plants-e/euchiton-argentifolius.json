    "intro": "Euchiton argentifolius, commonly known as silverleaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
