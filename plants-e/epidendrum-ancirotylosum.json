It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant features elongated, grass-like leaves and produces striking, pendulous flowers in shades of yellow and green. Its inflorescence is often adorned with a distinctive, elongated spur that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
