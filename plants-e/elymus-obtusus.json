    "intro": "Elymus obtusus, commonly known as bluntleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a blunt, rounded tip. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Elymus obtusus is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
