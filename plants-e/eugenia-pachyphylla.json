    "intro": "Eugenia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
