It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
