It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which appear in summer. Its bark is typically smooth and peels off in thin, papery strips. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
