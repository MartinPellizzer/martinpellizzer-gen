    "intro": "Escobariopsis prolifera, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their pale coloration. Its life cycle involves germination from seeds, followed by attachment to a host root system through specialized structures called haustoria. Escobariopsis prolifera is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in disturbed or open environments."
