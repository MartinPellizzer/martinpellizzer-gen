    "intro": "Eriocaulon echinaceum, commonly known as the spiny spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Eriocaulon echinaceum is often found in still or slow-moving water environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems."
