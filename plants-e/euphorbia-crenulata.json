    "intro": "Euphorbia crenulata, commonly known as the zigzag euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching, fleshy stems that often have a zigzag or ridged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia crenulata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. It is also noted for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions."
