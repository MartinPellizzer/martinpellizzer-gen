    "intro": "Episcia conferta, commonly known as the wax plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it its common name, and it produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Episcia conferta is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
