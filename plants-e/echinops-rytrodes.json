    "intro": "Echinops rytrodes, commonly known as the spiked centaury, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its spiky, spherical seed heads that are often mistaken for cacti due to their appearance. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops rytrodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
