    "intro": "Eutassa columnaris, commonly known as the slender lily, is a striking herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, straight stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in temperate regions."
