    "intro": "Eucalyptus oleosa subsp. oleosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are usually small and white or pink, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland areas. It is valued for its essential oils, which have applications in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
