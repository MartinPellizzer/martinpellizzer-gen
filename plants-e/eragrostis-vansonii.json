It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Eragrostis vansonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
