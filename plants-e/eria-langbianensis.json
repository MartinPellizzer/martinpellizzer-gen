    "intro": "Eria langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a short rhizome and linear leaves, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that is slightly curled. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria langbianensis is considered a vulnerable species."
