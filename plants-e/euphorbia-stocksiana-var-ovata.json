    "intro": "Euphorbia stocksiana var. ovata, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are smooth and oval-shaped, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
