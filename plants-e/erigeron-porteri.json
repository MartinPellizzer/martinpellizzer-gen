    "intro": "Erigeron porteri, commonly known as the Mexican fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Erigeron porteri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
