It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often disturbed soils, such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually reddish in color.
