    "intro": "Euonymus fortunei f. minimus, commonly known as the compact euonymus, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mounding habit. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist into the winter. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and adaptability. This variety is particularly valued for its compact form and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
