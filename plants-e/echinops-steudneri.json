    "intro": "Echinops steudneri, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which are a key feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Echinops steudneri is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils."
