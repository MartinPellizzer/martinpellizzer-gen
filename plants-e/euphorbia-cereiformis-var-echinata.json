    "intro": "Euphorbia cereiformis var. echinata, commonly known as the spiny candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, candle-like stems that are covered in soft, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental appearance. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is best suited for experienced growers."
