    "intro": "Euphrasia deflexifolia, commonly known as the drooping eyebright, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, while its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem. Euphrasia deflexifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though it is generally cultivated for its ornamental appeal."
