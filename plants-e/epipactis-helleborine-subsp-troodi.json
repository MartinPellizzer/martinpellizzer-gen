    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. troodi, commonly known as the Turkish helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to regions of southern Europe and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown patterns. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its ability to hybridize with other epipactis species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
