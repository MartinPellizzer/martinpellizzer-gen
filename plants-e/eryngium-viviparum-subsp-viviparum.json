    "intro": "Eryngium viviparum subsp. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flowers and palmately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. One notable feature is its viviparous reproduction, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
