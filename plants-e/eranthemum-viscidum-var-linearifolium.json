    "intro": "Eranthemum viscidum var. linearifolium, commonly known as the sticky eranthemum, is a variant of the eranthemum genus native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that give it a unique texture and help in water retention. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of pink or red, adding ornamental value to its habitat. The linearifolium variety is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves, which set it apart from other varieties within the species."
