    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus bustamantei, commonly known as the Bustamante's spiny ribbed cactus, is a rare and unique cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in spines. The plant typically grows in arid environments, adapting to harsh desert conditions with its water-storing stems. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from areoles along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
