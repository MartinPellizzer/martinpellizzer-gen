    "intro": "Echinops fontqueri, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a key feature in its common name. The plant has gray-green, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops fontqueri is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
