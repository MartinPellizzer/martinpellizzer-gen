    "intro": "Euonymus nanus f. turkestanicus, commonly known as the Turkestan dwarf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a slow growth rate, making it ideal for formal garden designs. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in compact clusters. It produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative hedge."
