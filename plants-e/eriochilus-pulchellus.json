    "intro": "Eriochilus pulchellus, commonly known as the pink snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, pink to mauve flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to rocky and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its harsh environment. It is well adapted to cool, dry conditions and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal cliffs. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a sought-after plant for native gardens and conservation efforts."
