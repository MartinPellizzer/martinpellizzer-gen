    "intro": "Echinocereus longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 inches. Its stems are cylindrical and ribbed, with a bluish-green color and a rough, waxy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
