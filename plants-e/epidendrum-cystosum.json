    "intro": "Epidendrum cystosum, commonly known as the \"Cystosum Vanda,\" is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has long, arching stems that bear clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in variable conditions. The flowers are typically long-lasting, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
