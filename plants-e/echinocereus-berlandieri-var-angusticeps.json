    "intro": "Echinocereus berlandieri var. angusticeps, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense clusters of spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh desert conditions with its succulent stems that store water. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
