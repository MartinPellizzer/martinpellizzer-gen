    "intro": "Erigeron platensis, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its spread across moist environments. Erigeron platensis plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
