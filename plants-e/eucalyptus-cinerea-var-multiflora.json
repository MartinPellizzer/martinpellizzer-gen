    "intro": "Eucalyptus cinerea var. multiflora, commonly known as the silver dollar gum, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its grey, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine, silvery-grey pubescence. This variety is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
