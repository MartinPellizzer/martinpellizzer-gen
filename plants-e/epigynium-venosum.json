    "intro": "Epigynium venosum, commonly known as the veiny epigynium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Piperaceae, which includes pepper plants, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant features a distinctive epigynous flower arrangement, where the ovary is positioned below the attachment point of the petals and sepals. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Epigynium venosum is considered a species of conservation concern."
