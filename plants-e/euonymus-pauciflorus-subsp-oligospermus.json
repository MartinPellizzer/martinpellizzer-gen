    "intro": "Euonymus pauciflorus subsp. oligospermus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered woodbine, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its persistent berries and attractive foliage throughout the growing season."
