    "intro": "Elytrigia littorea, commonly known as sea grass or salt meadow grass, is a flowering plant species native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline or brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Elytrigia littorea is well adapted to tidal fluctuations and can tolerate periodic submersion in water."
