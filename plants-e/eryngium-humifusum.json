    "intro": "Eryngium humifusum, commonly known as the creeping eryngium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower heads that are surrounded by spiny bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to its native habitat and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
