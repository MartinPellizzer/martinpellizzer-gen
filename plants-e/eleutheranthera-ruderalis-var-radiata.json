It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in abandoned fields. It has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. This species is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
