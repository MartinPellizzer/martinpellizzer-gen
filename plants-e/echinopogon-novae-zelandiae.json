It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, bristly leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Echinopogon novae-zelandiae is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
