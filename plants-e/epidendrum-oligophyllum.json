    "intro": "Epidendrum oligophyllum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Forest, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum oligophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
