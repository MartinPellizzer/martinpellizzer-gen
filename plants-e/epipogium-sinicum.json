    "intro": "Epipogium sinicum, commonly known as the Chinese ghost orchid, is a rare and intriguing member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it derives its nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis. The plant lacks chlorophyll and has a unique, small, fleshy root system that forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in the understory of temperate forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
