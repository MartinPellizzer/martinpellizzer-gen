    "intro": "Enicostema occidentale, commonly known as the western threadleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering structures consist of small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny seeds. Enicostema occidentale is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping and erosion control."
