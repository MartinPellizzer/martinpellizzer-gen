    "intro": "Eugenia pallidula, commonly known as the white eucalyptus, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the eastern coast of Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and open forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery bloom. Its small, white to pinkish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Eugenia pallidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in coastal environments."
