    "intro": "Eritrichium minimum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
