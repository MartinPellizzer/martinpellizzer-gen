    "intro": "Eriophyllum bahiifolium, commonly known as coastal goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Eriophyllum bahiifolium is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
