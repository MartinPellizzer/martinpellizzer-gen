    "intro": "Eliokarmos rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that turn reddish-purple with age, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
