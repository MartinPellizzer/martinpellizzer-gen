    "intro": "Eucnide, commonly known as the mistletoe plant, is a hemiparasitic shrub that belongs to the family Viscaraceae. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, using specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Eucnide species are typically evergreen, with small, leathery leaves and white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its ecological role is significant, as it supports various wildlife species and contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
