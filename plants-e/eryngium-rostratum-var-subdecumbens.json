    "intro": "Eryngium rostratum var. subdecumbens, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Americas. It features a rosette of stiff, spiny leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or purple composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are often prostrate, lying flat on the ground, which helps it spread rapidly. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
