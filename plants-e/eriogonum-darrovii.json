    "intro": "Eriogonum darrovii, commonly known as the Darrovi's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions. Eriogonum darrovii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
