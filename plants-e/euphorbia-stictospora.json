    "intro": "Euphorbia stictospora, commonly known as the white-spotted spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in white, waxy spots that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia stictospora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique visual characteristics."
