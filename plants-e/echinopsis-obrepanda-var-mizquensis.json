    "intro": "Echinopsis obrepanda var. mizquensis, commonly known as the Mizquense Hedgehog Cactus, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
