    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth variable horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems that are typically smooth and lack the ridges found in other horsetail varieties. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are essential for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
