    "intro": "Euphorbia tannensis var. eremophila, commonly known as the desert euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its spines and milky sap are defensive mechanisms against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
