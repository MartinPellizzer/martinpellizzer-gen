It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its adaptability to harsh climates."
