    "intro": "Euphorbia zambesiana var. benguelensis, commonly known as the Benguela euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
