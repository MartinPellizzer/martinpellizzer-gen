    "intro": "Eugenia glauca, commonly known as the glossy apple or blueberry ash, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has smooth, dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, blue-black berries that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. Eugenia glauca thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in warm climates. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
