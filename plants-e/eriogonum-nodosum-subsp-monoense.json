    "intro": "Eriogonum nodosum subsp. monoense, commonly known as the Mono Basin buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in the Mono Basin region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, glandular foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale pink seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators and its resilience to arid conditions."
