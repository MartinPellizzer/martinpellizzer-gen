    "intro": "Elaeocarpus dianxiensis, commonly known as the Dianxi elaeocarpus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan Province, where it grows in humid, mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits. The fruits contain several seeds enclosed in a hard, woody endocarp, which is typical of the genus Elaeocarpus. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
