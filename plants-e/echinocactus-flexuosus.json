    "intro": "Echinocactus flexuosus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that is covered in bright green, ribbed segments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
