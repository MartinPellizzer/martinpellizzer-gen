    "intro": "Eragrostis thyrsiflora, commonly known as tall muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted clusters of spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in full sun. Eragrostis thyrsiflora is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
