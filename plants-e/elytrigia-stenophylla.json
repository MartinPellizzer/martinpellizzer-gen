    "intro": "Elytrigia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Elytrigia stenophylla is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
