    "intro": "Eriachne mucronata var. helmsii, commonly known as the Helms' flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, preferring moist, acidic soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. The variety helmsii is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and narrower leaves compared to the typical form."
