    "intro": "Ecastaphyllum negrense, commonly known as the Negros flatworm, is a unique plant species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like structure and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has no true roots, stems, or leaves, and instead absorbs nutrients through its surface. It plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
