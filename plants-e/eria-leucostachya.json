    "intro": "Eria leucostachya, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Eria leucostachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
