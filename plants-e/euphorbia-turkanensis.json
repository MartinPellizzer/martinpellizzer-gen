    "intro": "Euphorbia turkanensis, commonly known as the Turkestan spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care. Euphorbia turkanensis is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic environments."
