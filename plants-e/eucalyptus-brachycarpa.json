    "intro": "Eucalyptus brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the winter months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Eucalyptus brachycarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
