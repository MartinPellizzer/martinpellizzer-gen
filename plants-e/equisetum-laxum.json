    "intro": "Equisetum laxum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that becomes hollow as it matures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are typically found near the base of the plant. Equisetum laxum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living seedless vascular plants."
