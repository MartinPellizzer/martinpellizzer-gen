    "intro": "Eugenia pustulata, commonly known as the rough-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or tubercles, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red or purple as they mature. Eugenia pustulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
