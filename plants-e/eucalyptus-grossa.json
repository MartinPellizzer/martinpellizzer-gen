    "intro": "Eucalyptus grossa, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, felt-like hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters and attracting various pollinators. The plant is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction, as well as for its historical use in traditional medicine."
