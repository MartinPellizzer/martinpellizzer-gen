    "intro": "Encephalartos ghellinckii, commonly known as the Gheerlings cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, dark green, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, woody female cones that develop into orange-red seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly protected and cultivated in botanical gardens."
