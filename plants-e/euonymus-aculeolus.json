    "intro": "Euonymus aculeolus, commonly known as the spiny euonymus, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Euonymus aculeolus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
