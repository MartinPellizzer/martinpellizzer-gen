    "intro": "Eritrichium sventenii, commonly known as the Sventenii's flower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cold, arid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it blooms during the short growing season of early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eritrichium sventenii is considered a vulnerable species."
