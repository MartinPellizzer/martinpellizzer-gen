It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and foliage, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
