    "intro": "Empetrum arcticum, commonly known as crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It has small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in jams and desserts. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, harsh environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Crowberry plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in its native ecosystems."
