It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its milky sap, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings."
