    "intro": "Epilobium meridense, commonly known as the southern willow herb, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and slightly woody at the base. Epilobium meridense plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
