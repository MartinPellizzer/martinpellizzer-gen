    "intro": "Eriogonum watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum watsonii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
