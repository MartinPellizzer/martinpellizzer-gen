    "intro": "Erysimum decumbens subsp. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean wallflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its flowering period contributes to the ecological diversity of mountainous regions in Europe."
