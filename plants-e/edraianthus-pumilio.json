    "intro": "Edraianthus pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf edraianthus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
