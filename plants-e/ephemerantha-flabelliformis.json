    "intro": "Ephemerantha flabelliformis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for survival. The plant produces delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
