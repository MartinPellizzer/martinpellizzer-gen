    "intro": "Elsholtzia fruticosa, commonly known as mountain betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China and the Tibetan Plateau. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features upright, branched stems covered with grayish-white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, usually blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, aromatic, and often have a minty scent, which contributes to its use in traditional medicine. Elsholtzia fruticosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
