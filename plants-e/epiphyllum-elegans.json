    "intro": "Epiphyllum elegans, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that grow horizontally and are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers have a strong, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Epiphyllum elegans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
