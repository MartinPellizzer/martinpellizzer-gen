    "intro": "Enterospermum littorale, commonly known as the coastal enterospermum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, aiding in its dispersal along coastal environments."
