    "intro": "Elephantosis liatroides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warm seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various parts of the world for landscaping purposes."
