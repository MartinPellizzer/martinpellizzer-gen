    "intro": "Espeletiopsis jajoensis, commonly known as the Jajo mountain cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
