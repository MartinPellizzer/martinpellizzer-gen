    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile var. attenuatum, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct morphological features. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, often calcareous soils. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments where it thrives in partial shade. This variety is notable for its reduced stature compared to the typical form, making it a distinctive member of the Equisetaceae family."
