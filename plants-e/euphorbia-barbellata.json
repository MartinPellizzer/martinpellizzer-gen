    "intro": "Euphorbia barbellata, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and adaptive features make it a striking addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes."
