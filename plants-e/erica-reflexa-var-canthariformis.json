    "intro": "Erica reflexa var. canthariformis, commonly known as the Cape heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
