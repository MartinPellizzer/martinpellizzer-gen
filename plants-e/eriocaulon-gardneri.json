    "intro": "Eriocaulon gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy habitats, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Eriocaulon gardneri is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants in marshy environments."
