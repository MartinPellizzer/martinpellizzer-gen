It has a distinctive appearance with elongated, tubular leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom during the summer months. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and wave action. Echioides elongata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
