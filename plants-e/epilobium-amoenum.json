    "intro": "Epilobium amoenum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern regions of the Americas. It features slender, erect stems covered in silvery-white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs. Epilobium amoenum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed sites."
