    "intro": "Epipactis atropurpurea f. pallens, commonly known as the pale epipactis, is a rare and distinctive orchid species characterized by its striking violet to purple flower coloration. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy flower that has a unique structure with a dark, almost black lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often growing on rocky or humus-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
