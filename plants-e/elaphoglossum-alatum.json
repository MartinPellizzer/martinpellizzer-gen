    "intro": "Elaphoglossum alatum, commonly known as the winged holly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive wing-like structure along the leaf margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Elaphoglossum alatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
