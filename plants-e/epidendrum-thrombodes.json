    "intro": "Epidendrum thrombodes, commonly known as the thrombodes epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
