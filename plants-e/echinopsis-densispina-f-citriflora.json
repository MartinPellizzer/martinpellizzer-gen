It features dense, spiny stems that are typically green or blue-green in color, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting moths and other night pollinators. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often sought after by collectors and conservationists."
