    "intro": "Eucalyptus zopherophloia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree form, with rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-gray hue, while the flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clustered groups. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and fire, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
