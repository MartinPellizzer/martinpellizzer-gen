    "intro": "Euphorbia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features fleshy, dark green leaves covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it."
