    "intro": "Erythraea suffruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and wood are valued for their durability and have been historically used in traditional crafts and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many regions."
