    "intro": "Euphorbia vaccaria var. erucoides, commonly known as the yellow-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its branched, upright stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, often with a slight reddish tinge. Euphorbia vaccaria var. erucoides is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
