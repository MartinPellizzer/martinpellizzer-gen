    "intro": "Euphorbia terracina var. mendax, commonly known as the Mediterranean spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation or collection."
