    "intro": "Espeletia chardonii, commonly known as the Chardonii heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Its foliage consists of narrow, evergreen leaves that form a basal rosette, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Espeletia chardonii is adapted to cold, dry conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
