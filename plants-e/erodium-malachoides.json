    "intro": "Erodium malachoides, commonly known as the silverleaf strewer, is a small annual herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds. Erodium malachoides is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in arid and semi-arid conditions."
