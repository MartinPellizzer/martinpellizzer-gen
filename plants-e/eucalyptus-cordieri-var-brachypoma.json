    "intro": "Eucalyptus cordieri var. brachypoma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and a slow growth rate. This variety is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
