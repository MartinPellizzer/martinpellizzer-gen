    "intro": "Echinocereus ortegae subsp. koehresianus, commonly known as the Sonoran prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a prickly pear, is edible and has a sweet, juicy pulp. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and minimizing water loss through its spiny exterior."
