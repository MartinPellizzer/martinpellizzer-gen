    "intro": "Epidendrum schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
