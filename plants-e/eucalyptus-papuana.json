    "intro": "Eucalyptus papuana, commonly known as the Papuan ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the highland regions of Papua, Indonesia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, while the flowers are small, white or pale blue, and clustered in umbels. It produces woody capsules as fruit, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in montane rainforest or heathland environments."
