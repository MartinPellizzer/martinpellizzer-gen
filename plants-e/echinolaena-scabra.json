    "intro": "Echinolaena scabra, commonly known as roughhedge, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with wiry, branching stems covered in fine, stiff hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by dry, three-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas, open woodlands, and along roadsides."
