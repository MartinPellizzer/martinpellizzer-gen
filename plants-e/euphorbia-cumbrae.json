    "intro": "Euphorbia cumbrae, commonly known as the Cumbrae spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia cumbrae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
