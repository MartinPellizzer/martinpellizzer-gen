    "intro": "Elaphoglossum revolutum, commonly known as the revolute holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum revolutum is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
