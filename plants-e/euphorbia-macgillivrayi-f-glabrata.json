    "intro": "Euphorbia macgillivrayi f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are smooth and often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced or absent, with the stems serving as the primary photosynthetic organs. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive periods of drought."
