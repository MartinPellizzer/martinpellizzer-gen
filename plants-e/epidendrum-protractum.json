    "intro": "Epidendrum protractum, commonly known as the long-stemmed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, arching stems that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Epidendrum protractum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
