    "intro": "Elytranthe parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic elytranthe, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. This plant typically grows on the stems of other plants, such as those in the genus Eupatorium. Its small, white or pink flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in the summer months. Elytranthe parasitica is often found in moist, shaded environments across the southeastern United States."
