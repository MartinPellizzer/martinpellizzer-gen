    "intro": "Elaterium quadrifidum, commonly known as the four-lobed elaterium, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrifid (four-lobed) leaves, which are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Elaterium quadrifidum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
