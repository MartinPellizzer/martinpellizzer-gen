It is characterized by its distinctive, red-veined leaves that are often covered in a waxy, white coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage and unique appearance. Euphorbia pulvinata is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
