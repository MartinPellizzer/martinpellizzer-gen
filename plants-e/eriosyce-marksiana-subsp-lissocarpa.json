    "intro": "Eriosyce marksiana subsp. lissocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed eriosyce, is a species of cactus native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
