    "intro": "Ebenus pavonii, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces clusters of bright red or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Ebenus pavonii is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
