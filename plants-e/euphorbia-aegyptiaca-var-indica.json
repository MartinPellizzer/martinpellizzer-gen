    "intro": "Euphorbia aegyptiaca var. indica, commonly known as the Egyptian spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a short, thick stem with spiny, lobed leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces a yellowish-green sap that contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or sandy environments. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
