    "intro": "Elaeagnus multiflora var. siphonantha, commonly known as the silverleaf multi-flora buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common invasive species in some regions."
