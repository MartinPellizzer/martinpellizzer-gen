    "intro": "Eriospermum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone eriosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Eriospermum calcareum is well-suited to rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops."
