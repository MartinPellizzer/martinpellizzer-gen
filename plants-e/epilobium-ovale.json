    "intro": "Epilobium ovale, commonly known as the oval willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, riverbanks, and marshy areas. The plant features erect, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The flowers are pink to purple, clustered in racemes, and bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
