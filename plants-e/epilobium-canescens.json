    "intro": "Epilobium canescens, commonly known as hairy willow herb, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its showy, pink to red flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Epilobium canescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
