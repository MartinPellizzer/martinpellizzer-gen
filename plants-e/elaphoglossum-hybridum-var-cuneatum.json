    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hybridum var. cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a notable species in the study of fern diversity."
