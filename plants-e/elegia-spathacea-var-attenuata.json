    "intro": "Elegia spathacea var. attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elegance, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of South America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with prominent spathaceous bracts, which are modified leaves that encase the inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or pond edge habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in water gardens and bog landscapes."
