    "intro": "Eupatorium amplifolium, commonly known as broadleaf eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along streams, thriving in moist, sunny environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture, and its flowers are small, white to pink, arranged in clusters. Eupatorium amplifolium is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
