    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum f. simplex, commonly known as the simple horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail characterized by its reduced branching. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features whorled leaves composed of small, needle-like segments, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems. Its stems are hollow and jointed, a distinctive feature of the Equisetum genus. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called sporangiophores for spore production."
