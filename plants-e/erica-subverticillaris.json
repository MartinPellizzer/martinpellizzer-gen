    "intro": "Erica subverticillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Erica subverticillaris typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor conditions of its natural habitat."
