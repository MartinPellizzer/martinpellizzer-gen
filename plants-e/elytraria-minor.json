    "intro": "Elytraria minor, commonly known as the dwarf elytraria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
