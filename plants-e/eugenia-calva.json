    "intro": "Eugenia calva, commonly known as the slender satinash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, bright red berries. Eugenia calva thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical and subtropical climates."
