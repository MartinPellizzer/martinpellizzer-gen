It features long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often floating on the water surface or submerged in shallow waters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It is often used in aquariums and ponds for its aesthetic appeal and ability to oxygenate water. Echinodorus longilineatus thrives in warm, tropical climates with moderate to high light exposure."
