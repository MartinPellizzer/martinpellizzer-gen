    "intro": "Erysimum \u00d7 helveticum, commonly known as the Alpine wallflower, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Erysimum cheiri and Erysimum hybrida. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring and is well adapted to rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Erysimum \u00d7 helveticum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
