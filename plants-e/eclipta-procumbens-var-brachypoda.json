    "intro": "Eclipta procumbens var. brachypoda, commonly known as dwarf false dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a sprawling growth habit with numerous slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks."
