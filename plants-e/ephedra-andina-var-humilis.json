    "intro": "Ephedra andina var. humilis, commonly known as the Andean ephedra, is a low-growing shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures. It contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. Due to its medicinal properties and ecological significance, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters."
