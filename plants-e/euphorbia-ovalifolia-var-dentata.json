    "intro": "Euphorbia ovalifolia var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
