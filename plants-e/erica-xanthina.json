It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun exposure. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments due to its drought tolerance. Erica xanthina is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
