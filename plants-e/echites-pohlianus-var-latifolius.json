    "intro": "Echites pohlianus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf echites, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features erect, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The leaves are lance-shaped, broad at the base, and often have a waxy coating to minimize transpiration. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
