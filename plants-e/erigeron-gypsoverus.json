    "intro": "Erigeron gypsoverus, commonly known as the gypsum daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and showy white to pale blue ray flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly in areas with high levels of gypsum, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
