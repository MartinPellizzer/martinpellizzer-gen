    "intro": "Erophila obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, obovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in a wheel-like pattern, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. Erophila obovata is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
