    "intro": "Efossus crispatus, commonly known as the curly-leaved fern, is a species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, frilled leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas gradually. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
