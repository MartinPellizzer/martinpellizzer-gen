    "intro": "Erodium geifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf commonweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in cultivated fields. Botanically, it belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae), and like other members of this family, it has compound leaves and produces legume-like pods."
