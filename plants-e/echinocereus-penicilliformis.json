It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It has spiny areoles and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
