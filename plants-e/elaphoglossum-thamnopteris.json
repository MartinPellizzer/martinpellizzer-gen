It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with serrated margins and a distinctive, often pale underside. This fern is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops."
