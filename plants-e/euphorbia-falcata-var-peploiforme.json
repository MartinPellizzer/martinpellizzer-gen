    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata var. peploiforme, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia (modified flower clusters) that are often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
