    "intro": "Echinomastus kakui, commonly known as the Kakui cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat. Echinomastus kakui is often found in coastal areas and is considered an endemic species to the Hawaiian Islands."
