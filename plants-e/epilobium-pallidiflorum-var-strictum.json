It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and linear, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers clustered in terminal spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed sites. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
