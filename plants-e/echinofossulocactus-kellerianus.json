    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus kellerianus, commonly known as the Keller's echinofossulocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its columnar stems covered in prominent, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its rugged appearance. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
