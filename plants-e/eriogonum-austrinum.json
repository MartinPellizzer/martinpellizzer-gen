    "intro": "Eriogonum austrinum, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is often found in coastal scrub ecosystems. Eriogonum austrinum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
