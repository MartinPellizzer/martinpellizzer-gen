    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's horse tail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. It has a distinctive appearance with whorls of small, needle-like leaves along its stem. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
