    "intro": "Ebnerella monancistria, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water lily, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps them float and resist water damage. The flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
