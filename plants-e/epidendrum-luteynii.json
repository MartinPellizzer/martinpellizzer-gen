    "intro": "Epidendrum luteynii, commonly known as the Yellow Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid conditions. Epidendrum luteynii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
