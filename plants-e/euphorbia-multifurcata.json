    "intro": "Euphorbia multifurcata, commonly known as the forked spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched, fleshy stems that often form a shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its thick, waxy leaves help it retain water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia multifurcata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
