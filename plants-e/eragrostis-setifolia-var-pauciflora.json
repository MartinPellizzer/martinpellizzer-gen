    "intro": "Eragrostis setifolia var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is characterized by its reduced flowering compared to the typical form, making it a distinctive and ecologically valuable plant in its native range."
