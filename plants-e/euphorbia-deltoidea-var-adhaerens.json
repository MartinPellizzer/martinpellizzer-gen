    "intro": "Euphorbia deltoidea var. adhaerens, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, deltoid-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and has a thick stem that stores water. The leaves are usually deciduous, shedding during periods of drought to conserve moisture."
