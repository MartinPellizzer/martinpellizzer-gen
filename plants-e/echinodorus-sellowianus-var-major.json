    "intro": "Echinodorus sellowianus var. major, commonly known as Amazon Sword, is a popular aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments and is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance. It prefers moderate to high light conditions and can tolerate a range of water temperatures. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense underwater foliage, making it an effective plant for oxygenating water and providing habitat for aquatic life."
