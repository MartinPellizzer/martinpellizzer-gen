    "intro": "Euphorbia sieboldiana var. montana, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts. The plant has a succulent appearance with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation and propagation."
