    "intro": "Epidendrum macropodum, commonly known as the giant panda orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy pseudobulbs and long, arching leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture. Epidendrum macropodum is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
