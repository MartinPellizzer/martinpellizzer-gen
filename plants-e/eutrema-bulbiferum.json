    "intro": "Eutrema bulbiferum, commonly known as the sea onion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the western Pacific. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, aiding its survival in saline and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by clusters of bulbous structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. Its adaptability to salt spray and sandy soils makes it a hardy species often found in maritime climates. The plant's unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study and cultivation."
