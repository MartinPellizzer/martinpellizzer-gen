    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. zirnsackiana, commonly known as the Zirnsackian helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple-brown markings. The plant is a perennial, often growing in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and woodlands. It produces a single spike of flowers, which can range from 10 to 30 centimeters in height. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, involving small flies that are attracted to its floral structure."
