    "intro": "Euphorbia aspera var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
