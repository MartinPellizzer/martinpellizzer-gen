    "intro": "Eriocaulon ibeji, commonly known as the Ibeji grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Nigeria, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in swampy areas and along riverbanks, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
