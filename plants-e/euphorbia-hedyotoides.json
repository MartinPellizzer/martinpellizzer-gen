    "intro": "Euphorbia hedyotoides, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous thin, succulent stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic. Euphorbia hedyotoides is often used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its drought tolerance."
