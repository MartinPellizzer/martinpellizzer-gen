    "intro": "Epistephium sclerophyllum, commonly known as the rock heath, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, protective layer that helps reduce water loss. Epistephium sclerophyllum is often found growing on limestone or sandy soils in open, sunny habitats."
