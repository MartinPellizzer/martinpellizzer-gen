    "intro": "Eucalyptus albens, commonly known as the white gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue, and are covered in a fine, whitish bloom. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is valued for its timber and has a role in traditional Aboriginal uses."
