    "intro": "Elymus cordilleranus, commonly known as the Sierra wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Elymus cordilleranus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
