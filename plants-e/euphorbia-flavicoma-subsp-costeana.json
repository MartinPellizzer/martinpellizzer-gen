    "intro": "Euphorbia flavicoma subsp. costeana, commonly known as the yellow-flowered euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, woody stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a yellowish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
