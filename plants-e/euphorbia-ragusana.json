    "intro": "Euphorbia ragusana, commonly known as the Ragusa spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-shaped inflorescence called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia ragusana is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, which helps it survive in harsh conditions."
