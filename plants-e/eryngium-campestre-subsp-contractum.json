    "intro": "Eryngium campestre subsp. contractum, commonly known as the narrowleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bristly, globose fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and narrower leaf structure compared to the typical form of Eryngium campestre."
