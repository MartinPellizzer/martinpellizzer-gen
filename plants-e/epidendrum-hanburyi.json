It features long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
