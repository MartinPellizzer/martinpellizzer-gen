    "intro": "Eremophila pantonii, commonly known as the pink woolly bush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for dry gardens. Eremophila pantonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and role in supporting native wildlife."
