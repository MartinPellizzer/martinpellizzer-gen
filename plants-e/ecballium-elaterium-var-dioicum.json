    "intro": "Ecballium elaterium var. dioicum, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, prickly fruit capsules that mature into spherical, spiky structures. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a feature known as dioecy. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
