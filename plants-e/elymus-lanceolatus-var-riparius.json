    "intro": "Elymus lanceolatus var. riparius, commonly known as the riparian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually blue-green in color, and it produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in the summer. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
