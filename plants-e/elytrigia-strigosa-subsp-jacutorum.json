    "intro": "Elytrigia strigosa subsp. jacutorum, commonly known as seaside grass or beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often used for dune stabilization due to its extensive root system. This subspecies is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
