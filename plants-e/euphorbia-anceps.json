    "intro": "Euphorbia anceps, commonly known as the Cape coral tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern and clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has thick, often ribbed stems that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its leaves are usually small, alternate, and sometimes reduced to spines, especially in mature plants. Euphorbia anceps is adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
