It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland and marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually alternate and may vary in shape, while its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature. Euphorbia dobrogensis is often found in areas with high water tables and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native habitat."
