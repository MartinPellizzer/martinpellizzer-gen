    "intro": "Eleocharis funebris, commonly known as black needlegrass, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, dark-colored culms and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis funebris is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
