    "intro": "Epigeneium zebrinum, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, elongated leaves that often display a distinctive zebra-like pattern of dark green and light green stripes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, porous soil to prevent root rot. Epigeneium zebrinum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ease of care. It is typically propagated through stem cuttings, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
