    "intro": "Erepsia aspera, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Erepsia aspera is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal dunes and gravel plains."
