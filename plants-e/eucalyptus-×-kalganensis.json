It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
