    "intro": "Ephedra ochreata var. striata, commonly known as the striated ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its green to yellow-green stems, which are often covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the characteristic alkaloids, including ephedrine. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
