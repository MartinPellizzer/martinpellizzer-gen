    "intro": "Echinochloa zelayensis, commonly known as grassy weed or wild millet, is a species of annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, contributing to weed management challenges. Echinochloa zelayensis is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
