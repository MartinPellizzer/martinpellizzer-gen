It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. This plant is typically found in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in wetland environments. It produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are borne on the upper part of the stem. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and has historical significance in herbal practices."
