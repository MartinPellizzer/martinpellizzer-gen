    "intro": "Equisetum pallidum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its leaves are reduced to small, sterile, scale-like projections. It thrives in wet, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Equisetum pallidum is an ancient plant species that has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
