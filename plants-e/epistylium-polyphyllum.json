    "intro": "Epistylium polyphyllum, commonly known as the branched stalked stalk, is a colonial marine invertebrate belonging to the order Rhodactynida. It forms dense mats on submerged surfaces such as rocks and shells in coastal and estuarine environments. The organism is characterized by its branched, stalk-like structures that support a dense covering of zooids. Each zooid is a tiny, filter-feeding polyp that contributes to the colony's overall structure and function. Epistylium polyphyllum plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
