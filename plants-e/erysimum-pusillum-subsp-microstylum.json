    "intro": "Erysimum pusillum subsp. microstylum, commonly known as the dwarf wallflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has glabrous, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and colorful blooms."
