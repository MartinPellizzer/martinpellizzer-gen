    "intro": "Echinocereus rotatus, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines and bright, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to 3 feet and is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The flowers appear in late spring and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
