    "intro": "Euphorbia thelesperma, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia thelesperma plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
