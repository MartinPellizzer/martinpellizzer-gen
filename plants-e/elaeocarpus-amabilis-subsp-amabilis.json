    "intro": "Elaeocarpus amabilis subsp. amabilis, commonly known as the red sanders, is a member of the Elaeocarpaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, orange-red fruits. Its bark and wood are highly valued for their aromatic properties and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. Due to overexploitation, it is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
