    "intro": "Ellobium fulgens, commonly known as the golden ellobium, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Ellobium fulgens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
