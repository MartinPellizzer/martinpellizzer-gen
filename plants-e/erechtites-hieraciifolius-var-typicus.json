    "intro": "Erechtites hieraciifolius var. typicus, commonly known as the common ironweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, often mistaken for those of the stinging nettle. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
