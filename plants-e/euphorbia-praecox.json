    "intro": "Euphorbia praecox, commonly known as early spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features simple, alternate leaves that are usually green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care."
