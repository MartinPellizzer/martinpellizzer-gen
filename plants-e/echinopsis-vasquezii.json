    "intro": "Echinopsis vasquezii, commonly known as the Vasquez's cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, white to pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Echinopsis vasquezii is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or semi-desert regions."
