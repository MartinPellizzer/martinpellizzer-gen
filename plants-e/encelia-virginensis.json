    "intro": "Encelia virginensis, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. The plant has silvery-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Encelia virginensis plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
