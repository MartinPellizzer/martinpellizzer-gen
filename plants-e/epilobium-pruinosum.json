    "intro": "Epilobium pruinosum, commonly known as sticky willow or velvetleaf willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, hairy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows. Epilobium pruinosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
