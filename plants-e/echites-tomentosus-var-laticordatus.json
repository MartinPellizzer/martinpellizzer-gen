It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white tomentum. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
