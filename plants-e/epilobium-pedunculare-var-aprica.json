    "intro": "Epilobium pedunculare var. aprica, commonly known as the spring willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
