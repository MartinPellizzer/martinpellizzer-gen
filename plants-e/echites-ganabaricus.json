    "intro": "Echites ganabaricus, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant is notable for its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and other irritants that cause a painful reaction upon contact. It thrives in moist, nitrogen-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Echites ganabaricus plays a role in supporting pollinators and can be used in traditional medicine, though its stinging properties require caution when handling."
