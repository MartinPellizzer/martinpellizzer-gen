It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure with overlapping lobes. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in humid forest floors, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention. Escobariopsis lenta is often found in temperate regions and is known for its slow growth rate and resilience to environmental stress. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for assessing habitat health and biodiversity."
