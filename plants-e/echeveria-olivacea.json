It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that often have a bluish or purplish hue. The plant produces showy, violet-pink flowers on tall stems during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
