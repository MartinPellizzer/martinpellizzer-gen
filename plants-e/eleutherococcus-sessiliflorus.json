    "intro": "Eleutherococcus sessiliflorus, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Russia, northeastern China, and northern Korea. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, reaching up to 2 meters in height, and its pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, valued for their adaptogenic properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
