    "intro": "Eranthemum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific eranthemum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Eranthemum pacificum is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
