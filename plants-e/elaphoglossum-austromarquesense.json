    "intro": "Elaphoglossum austromarquesense, commonly known as the southern Marquesan holly fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
