    "intro": "Eustylis punctata, commonly known as the spotted stiltgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that often branch near the base, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its seeds are small and winged, aiding in wind dispersal. Eustylis punctata is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions."
