    "intro": "Eucalyptus peltata subsp. leichhardtii, commonly known as the Leichhardt's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey to white bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are small, white or pale green, and clustered in umbels, often appearing in late winter to early spring. It produces woody capsules that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to survive in low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and unique appearance."
