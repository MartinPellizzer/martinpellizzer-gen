    "intro": "Elymus leianthus, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences that resemble plumes. This plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Elymus leianthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
