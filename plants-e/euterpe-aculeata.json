    "intro": "Euterpe aculeata, commonly known as the spiny palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, green fruits. The fruits are typically harvested for their edible pulp, which has a sweet, tropical flavor. Euterpe aculeata is often found in humid tropical forests and plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional uses."
