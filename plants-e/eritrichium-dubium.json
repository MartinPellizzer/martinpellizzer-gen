    "intro": "Eritrichium dubium, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Eritrichium dubium is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
