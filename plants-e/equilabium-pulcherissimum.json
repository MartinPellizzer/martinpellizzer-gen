    "intro": "Equilabium pulcherissimum, commonly known as the beautiful labellum, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that display a unique combination of colors, often featuring a striking contrast between the petals and the labellum. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its delicate structure and intricate floral morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
