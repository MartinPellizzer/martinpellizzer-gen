    "intro": "Erythroxylum deciduum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wild coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding leaves seasonally in response to environmental conditions. The plant features lanceolate, narrow leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside, which is a notable botanical trait. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This species is closely related to other coca species and has been of interest for both its ecological role and traditional uses."
