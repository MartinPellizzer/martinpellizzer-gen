    "intro": "Echioglossum seidenfadenii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and a single, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly figures, contributing to its ethereal beauty. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
