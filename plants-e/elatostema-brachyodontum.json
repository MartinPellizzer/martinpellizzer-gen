    "intro": "Elatostema brachyodontum, commonly known as the small-toothed elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive, small-toothed margin, giving it its specific epithet. Elatostema brachyodontum produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance."
