    "intro": "Epidendrum agoyanense, commonly known as the Agoyanense orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red with yellow markings, blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
