    "intro": "Erycibe paniculata var. coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered erycibe, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a woody vine characterized by its striking red flowers, which are clustered in panicles. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely cultivated."
