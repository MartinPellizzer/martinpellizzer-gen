    "intro": "Euphorbia cespitosa subsp. ventanicola, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a dense mat of fleshy, green stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
