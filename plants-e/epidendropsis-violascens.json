    "intro": "Epidendropsis violascens, commonly known as the violet-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often violet-hued stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendropsis violascens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
