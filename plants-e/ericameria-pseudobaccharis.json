It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Ericameria pseudobaccharis plays a role in supporting local wildlife and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
