    "intro": "Epipactis trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a tall, erect stem that bears a single spike of showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers. The plant typically blooms from June to August and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands or along stream banks. Epipactis trinervia is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
