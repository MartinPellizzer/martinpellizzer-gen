    "intro": "Eucalyptus heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from narrow and linear to broader forms, depending on the environmental conditions. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in late winter to early spring. It is a hardy shrub or small tree that thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The species is notable for its ability to withstand harsh climates and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
