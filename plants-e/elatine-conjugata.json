    "intro": "Elatine conjugata, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and streams. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in aquatic settings. Its flowers are usually tiny and clustered, with four petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Elatine conjugata is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to water quality and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
