    "intro": "Euphorbia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Euphorbia sarmentosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
