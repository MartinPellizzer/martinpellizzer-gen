    "intro": "Erica planifolia var. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf heath, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low, compact growth habit and evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal landscaping."
