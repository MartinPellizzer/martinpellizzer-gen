It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in its native habitat."
