    "intro": "Elymus canadensis var. villosus, commonly known as Canadian foxtail grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble a foxtail. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bluish-green and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its coarse texture. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
