    "intro": "Eleocharis tsurumachii, commonly known as the Japanese spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, pond margins, and along streams. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis tsurumachii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
