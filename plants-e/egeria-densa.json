It has long, flexible stems that can grow up to 2 meters in length, often forming dense mats in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which bloom near the water surface. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, arranged in pairs along the stem. Egeria densa plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic life."
