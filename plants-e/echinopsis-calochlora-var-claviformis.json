    "intro": "Echinopsis calochlora var. claviformis, commonly known as the Claviform Echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a spiny exterior, with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements. This variety is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
