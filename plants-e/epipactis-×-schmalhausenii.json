    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 schmalhausenii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe. It is a hybrid between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine, resulting in a plant with unique floral characteristics. The plant produces dense, dark green leaves and bears a long, spike-like inflorescence adorned with numerous small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its hybrid nature makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
