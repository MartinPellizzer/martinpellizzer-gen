    "intro": "Ephedra heterosperma, commonly known as the Great Basin ephedra, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and reddish-brown seeds, which are enclosed in specialized structures called stipitate glands. Ephedra heterosperma is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions. It contains alkaloids, including ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine."
