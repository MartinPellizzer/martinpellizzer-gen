    "intro": "Encyclia guttata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. Its flowers typically bloom in clusters, with three sepals and three petals, and a specialized lip that aids in pollination. Encyclia guttata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
