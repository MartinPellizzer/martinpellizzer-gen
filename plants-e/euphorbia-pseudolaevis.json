    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudolaevis, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, which is a thickened stem base, and produces fleshy, ribbed stems that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant has small, green leaves that are often reduced or absent, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia pseudolaevis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
