It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to harsh conditions."
