    "intro": "Escallonia alpina var. glaberrima, commonly known as the Alpine Escallonia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which is typically covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with cool, temperate climates."
