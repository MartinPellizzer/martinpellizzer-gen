    "intro": "Epidendrum verrucosum var. myrianthum, commonly known as the velvety epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. The species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
