    "intro": "Euphorbia malurensis, commonly known as the Maluara euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the genus Euphorbia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions. Due to its ornamental appearance and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscapes."
