    "intro": "Eucalyptus albida, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a white or greyish underside. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
