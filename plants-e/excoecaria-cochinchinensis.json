It is a small to medium-sized tree that thrives in coastal areas and brackish water environments. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces edible fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various animals. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
