    "intro": "Eryngium pratense var. depressa, commonly known as the low thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of blue-gray, woolly leaves and produces striking spiny, purple-blue flower heads that resemble a thistle. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and grasslands. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and ecological restoration projects. The species is also valued for its ability to support pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
