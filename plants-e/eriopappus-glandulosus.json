    "intro": "Eriopappus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky bluestem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flower heads. The plant produces a distinctive pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and desert scrub. Eriopappus glandulosus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
