    "intro": "Euodia cinerea, commonly known as the silverwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are typically followed by small, round, woody fruits. Euodia cinerea is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant. It is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats."
