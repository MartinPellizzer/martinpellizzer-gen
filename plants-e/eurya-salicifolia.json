    "intro": "Eurya salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Eurya salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
