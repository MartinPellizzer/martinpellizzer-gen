It is characterized by its spiky, spherical seed heads that become prominent in the autumn. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Echinops meyeri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
