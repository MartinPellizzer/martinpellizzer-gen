    "intro": "Eucalyptus drummondii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often coated with a whitish bloom, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its aromatic oils, derived from the leaves, have been used in traditional medicine and for their antimicrobial properties. Eucalyptus drummondii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
