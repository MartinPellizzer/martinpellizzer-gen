    "intro": "Ericameria watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's golden bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, composite flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It has a compact growth habit with multiple stems and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Ericameria watsonii produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or sandy soils."
