It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green or blue-green in color, with white or pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
