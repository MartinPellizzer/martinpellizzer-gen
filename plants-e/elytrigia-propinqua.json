It features fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and marginal habitats. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a forage plant and its use in ecological restoration projects."
