    "intro": "Eccremocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their cylindrical stems and the presence of areoles, which bear spines, flowers, and sometimes glochids. The flowers, which open at night, are typically white or pale yellow and are a key feature for attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Eccremocereus species are generally low maintenance, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water, making them popular among succulent enthusiasts. Their unique blooming pattern and striking appearance make them a notable addition to arid landscape designs."
