    "intro": "Endiandra xylophylla, commonly known as the Australian ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Endiandra xylophylla is considered a vulnerable species."
