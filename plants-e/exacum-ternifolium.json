    "intro": "Exacum ternifolium, commonly known as the three-leaved pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its preference for warmer climates."
