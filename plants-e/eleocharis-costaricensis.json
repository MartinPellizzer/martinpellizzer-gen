It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. Its morphology includes slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis costaricensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
