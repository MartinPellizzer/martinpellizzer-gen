    "intro": "Encholirium biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of Mexico. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in mountainous regions where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Encholirium biflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique beauty."
