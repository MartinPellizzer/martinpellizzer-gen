    "intro": "Erigeron acris subsp. mesatlanticus, commonly known as the eastern blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow disc in the summer. Its flowering period extends from June to September, and it is often found in moist to mesic habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to other Erigeron species."
