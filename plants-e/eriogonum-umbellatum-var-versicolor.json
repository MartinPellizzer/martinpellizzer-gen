    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. versicolor, commonly known as the Sierra sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, depending on the variety. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
