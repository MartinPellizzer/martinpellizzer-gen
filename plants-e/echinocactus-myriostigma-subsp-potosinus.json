    "intro": "Echinocactus myriostigma subsp. potosinus, commonly known as the Potos\u00ed cactus, is a species native to northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense, radial spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in cactus gardens."
