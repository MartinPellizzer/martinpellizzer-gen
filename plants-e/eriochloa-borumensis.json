    "intro": "Eriochloa borumensis, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in spikelets. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Eriochloa borumensis is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
