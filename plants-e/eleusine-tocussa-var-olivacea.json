    "intro": "Eleusine tocussa var. olivacea, commonly known as the olive bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots make it suitable for erosion control and soil stabilization in degraded lands. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas."
