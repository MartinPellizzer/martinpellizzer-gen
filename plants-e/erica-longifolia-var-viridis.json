    "intro": "Erica longifolia var. viridis, commonly known as the green heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green color, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or pale purple during the spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
