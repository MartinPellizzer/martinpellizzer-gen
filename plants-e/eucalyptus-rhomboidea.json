    "intro": "Eucalyptus rhomboidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus rhomboidea is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in shrublands and woodlands. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, have been used in traditional and modern medicine for their therapeutic properties."
