    "intro": "Elymus abolinii var. divaricans, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
