    "intro": "Euphorbia carnosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North America. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Euphorbia carnosa is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand extreme temperatures. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
