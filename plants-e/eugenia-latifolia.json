    "intro": "Eugenia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often broader than they are long. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture. The species is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
