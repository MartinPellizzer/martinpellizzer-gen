    "intro": "Echites ellipticus, commonly known as the narrowleaf echites, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with narrow, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are adapted to attract pollinators in its harsh environment. Echites ellipticus is known for its resilience to drought and is often used in traditional medicine by local communities."
