    "intro": "Echites sanctae-crucis, commonly known as the Holy Cross Cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Echites sanctae-crucis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in xeriscaping."
