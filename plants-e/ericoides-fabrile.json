    "intro": "Ericoides fabrile, commonly known as the velvetleaf heath, is a shrub belonging to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides fabrile thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. It plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
