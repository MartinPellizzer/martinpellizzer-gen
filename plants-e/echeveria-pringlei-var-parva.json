It features vibrant, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to maintain its compact shape. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container gardening."
