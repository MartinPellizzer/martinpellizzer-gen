    "intro": "Epilobium mollissimum, commonly known as velvetleaf willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and damp woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Epilobium mollissimum is also known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivorous insects."
