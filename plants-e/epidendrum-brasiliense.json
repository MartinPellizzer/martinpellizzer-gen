    "intro": "Epidendrum brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded conditions. Epidendrum brasiliense is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
