    "intro": "Eriogonum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces pale pink to white flowers in early summer. Eriogonum parvifolium plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
