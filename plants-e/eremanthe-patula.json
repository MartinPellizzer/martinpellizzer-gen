    "intro": "Eremanthe patula, commonly known as the dwarf goldenstar, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking contrast to its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Eremanthe patula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
