    "intro": "Elaphoglossum flaccidum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Adiantaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery or pale underside. The fronds are often covered with fine, ciliate (bristly) hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
