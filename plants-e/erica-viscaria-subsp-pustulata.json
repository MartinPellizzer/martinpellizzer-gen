    "intro": "Erica viscaria subsp. pustulata, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its profusion of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture and help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. The subspecies pustulata is distinguished by its more robust growth and larger flowers compared to other forms of Erica viscaria."
