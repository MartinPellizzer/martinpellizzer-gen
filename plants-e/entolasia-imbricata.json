    "intro": "Entolasia imbricata, commonly known as the rock wallaby or the rock wallaby lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It has a distinctive, flattened thallus with a leathery texture and a yellowish to orange-brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides photosynthetic capabilities. It is often found on limestone and sandstone surfaces, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats. Its slow growth and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
