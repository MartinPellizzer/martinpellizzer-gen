    "intro": "Euphrasia fragosa, commonly known as the fragrant eyebright, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers with prominent yellow markings, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are often hairy, and the leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs. Euphrasia fragosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
