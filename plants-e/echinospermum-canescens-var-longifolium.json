    "intro": "Echinospermum canescens var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved thistle, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features silver-gray, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces spiny, spherical heads of yellow flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically elongated and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. The species is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
