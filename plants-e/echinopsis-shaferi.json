    "intro": "Echinopsis shaferi, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and a distinctive crown of bright, colorful flowers that bloom at night. The plant is a hybrid, often grafted onto a rootstock of another cactus species, which contributes to its unique appearance. Its flowers are typically white, yellow, or pink, and they emit a sweet fragrance. Echinopsis shaferi is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
