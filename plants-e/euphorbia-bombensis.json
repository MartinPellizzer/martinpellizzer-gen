    "intro": "Euphorbia bombensis, commonly known as the Bomba euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to Madagascar. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching out into a tree-like structure. The plant produces clusters of yellow cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by specialized leaves. Its fleshy leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. Euphorbia bombensis is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
