    "intro": "Equisetum veronense, commonly known as the Veronese horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wetlands. Equisetum veronense is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history dating back to the Paleozoic era."
