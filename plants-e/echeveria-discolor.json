    "intro": "Echeveria discolor, commonly known as the Snowy Echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that turn pink or red when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil and full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
