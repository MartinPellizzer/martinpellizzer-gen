    "intro": "Eragrostis cilianensis f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf Cilian grass, is a compact, tufted perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10-30 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
