    "intro": "Eschweilera cordata, commonly known as the pink-flowered wax palm, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the canopy. Eschweilera cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
