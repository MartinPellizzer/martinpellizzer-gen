It features small, needle-like leaves that are dense and dark green, providing a lush, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers that resemble jasmine, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
