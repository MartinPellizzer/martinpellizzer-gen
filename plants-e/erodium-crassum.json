    "intro": "Erodium crassum, commonly known as broad-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that dehisce to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Erodium crassum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
