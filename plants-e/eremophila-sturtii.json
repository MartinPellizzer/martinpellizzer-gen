    "intro": "Eremophila sturtii, commonly known as Sturt's eremophila, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact, often grey-green foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with small leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that access groundwater. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Eremophila sturtii is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens due to its resilience and ornamental value."
