    "intro": "Echinopsis peitscherana, commonly known as the Peitscher's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is a spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem that can grow up to 50 centimeters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically nocturnal in blooming habits. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Echinopsis peitscherana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
