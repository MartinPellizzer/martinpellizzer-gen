    "intro": "Euonymus verrucosus var. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese spurge, is a perennial shrub native to East Asia. It features alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. However, due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
