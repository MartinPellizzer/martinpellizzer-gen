It features a compact, globular shape with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to arid landscapes."
