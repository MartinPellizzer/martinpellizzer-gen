    "intro": "Erophila inconspicua, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a small annual herb native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. It produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its inconspicuous appearance, it is often overlooked despite its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
