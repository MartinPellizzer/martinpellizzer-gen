    "intro": "Echinochloa zenkowskii, commonly known as the grassy weed or broadleaf signalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces spikelets that are often bracted and can be either sessile or pedicellate. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
