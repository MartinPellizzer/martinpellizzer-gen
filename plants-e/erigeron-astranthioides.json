It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
