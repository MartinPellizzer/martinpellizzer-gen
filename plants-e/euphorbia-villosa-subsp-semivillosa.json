    "intro": "Euphorbia villosa subsp. semivillosa, commonly known as the soft-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique appearance and ability to withstand drought conditions."
