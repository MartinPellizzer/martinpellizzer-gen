    "intro": "Eulophia, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their complex and often showy flowers, which typically feature three sepals and three petals, with one of the petals modified into a lip. Eulophia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They thrive in moist, shaded environments and often grow as epiphytes or terrestrial plants. The genus includes over 200 species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
