    "intro": "Elatine rubella, commonly known as the red waterwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Elatinaceae. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has tiny, opposite leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that appear above the water surface. Its root system helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality. Elatine rubella is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed aquatic habitats."
