    "intro": "Euphorbia piscidermis, commonly known as the fish-skin euphorbia, is a unique succulent plant characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that resemble fish scales. It is native to arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in hot, dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its stems are typically green and fleshy, adapted for water storage. Euphorbia piscidermis is known for its low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
