    "intro": "Echinacea porteri, commonly known as the Texas coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the south-central United States. It is characterized by its upright stem, which can grow up to 2 to 3 feet tall, and its striking, purple-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, spiky seed head that persists through the winter, adding visual interest to the landscape. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Echinacea porteri is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
