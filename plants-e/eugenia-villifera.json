    "intro": "Eugenia villifera, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, bright red berries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Eugenia villifera is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
