    "intro": "Euphorbia steelpoortensis, commonly known as the Steelport euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, cylindrical stems covered in a thick layer of white, waxy epicuticular hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-shaped inflorescence called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
