    "intro": "Euphorbia tanaicensis, commonly known as the Tanaic Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Tanaic Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green and sometimes tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
