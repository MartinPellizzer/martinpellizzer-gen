    "intro": "Echinocactus ingens f. saltillensis, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the Sonoran Desert. This subspecies is characterized by its massive, columnar stem that can grow up to 20 meters in height, featuring a ribbed structure and a dense covering of white spines. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, relying on minimal rainfall and well-drained soil for optimal growth. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species within its native habitat."
