    "intro": "Evelyna purpurea, commonly known as the purple velvet orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety purple petals and intricate, spurred-like structures on its flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a dark green hue that contrasts beautifully with its vibrant blooms. Evelyna purpurea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
