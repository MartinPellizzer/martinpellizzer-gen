    "intro": "Erophila verna var. graminea, commonly known as the early yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in grassy habitats, such as meadows and pastures, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, and it is also known to have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its contribution to biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
