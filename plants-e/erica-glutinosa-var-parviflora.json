    "intro": "Erica glutinosa var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, giving it its scientific name \"glutinosa.\" The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
