    "intro": "Eugenia ptariensis, commonly known as the Patarian guava, is a small evergreen tree native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits with a thick, leathery skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Eugenia ptariensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit, though it is less commonly consumed than other guava species."
