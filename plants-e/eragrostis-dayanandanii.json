It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
