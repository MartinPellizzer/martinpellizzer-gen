    "intro": "Eucalyptus rubiginosa, commonly known as the red box, is a medium to tall tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that often has a reddish hue, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive blue-green color when fresh. It produces small white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
