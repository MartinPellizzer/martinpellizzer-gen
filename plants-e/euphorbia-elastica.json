    "intro": "Euphorbia elastica, commonly known as the rubber plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of a yellowish cyathium surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia elastica is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to tolerate low light and minimal watering."
