    "intro": "Exochorda grandiflora prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate meadowsweet, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern North America. It features spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, ornamental berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions."
