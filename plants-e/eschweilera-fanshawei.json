    "intro": "Eschweilera fanshawei, commonly known as the Guangxi beauty leaf, is a rare evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of southern China. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often deeply veined. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
