It features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spiny, leafless stems and unique floral structures. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy tissues. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
