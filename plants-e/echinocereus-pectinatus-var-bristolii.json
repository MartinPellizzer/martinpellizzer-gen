    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus var. bristolii, commonly known as the Bristol cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
