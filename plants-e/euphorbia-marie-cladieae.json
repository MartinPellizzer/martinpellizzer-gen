    "intro": "Euphorbia marie-cladieae, commonly known as Marie-Claire's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically spiny, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia marie-cladieae is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water to thrive."
