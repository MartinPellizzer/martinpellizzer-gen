    "intro": "Elaphoglossum semisubulatum, commonly known as the slender-tipped water fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a distinctive, subulate (awl-shaped) appearance on the terminal pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
