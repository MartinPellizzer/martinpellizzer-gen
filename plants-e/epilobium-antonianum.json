    "intro": "Epilobium antonianum, commonly known as the purple willow or antonian willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Epilobium antonianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
