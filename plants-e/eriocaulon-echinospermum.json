    "intro": "Eriocaulon echinospermum, commonly known as the spiny-seeded flat sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Eriocaulon echinospermum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
