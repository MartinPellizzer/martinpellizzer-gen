    "intro": "Euphorbia digestiva, commonly known as the digestive euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia digestiva is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
