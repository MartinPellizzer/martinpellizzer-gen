    "intro": "Eryngium dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers and its distinctive branching pattern. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched until the upper part. Eryngium dichotomum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
