    "intro": "Erianthus ravennae var. binervis, commonly known as the two-veined reed, is a variant of the reed grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct two veins. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near water bodies. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
