    "intro": "Euphorbia jablonskii, commonly known as the Jablonski's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often modified into spines, providing defense against herbivores. Euphorbia jablonskii thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
