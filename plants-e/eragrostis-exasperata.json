    "intro": "Eragrostis exasperata, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eragrostis exasperata is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along rocky outcrops."
