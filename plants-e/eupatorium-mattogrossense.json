    "intro": "Eupatorium mattogrossense, commonly known as the Brazilian feverfew, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom during the rainy season. Eupatorium mattogrossense is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
