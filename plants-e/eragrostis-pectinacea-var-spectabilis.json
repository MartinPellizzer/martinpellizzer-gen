    "intro": "Eragrostis pectinacea var. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, showy inflorescence that resembles a tuft of hair. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to golden yellow flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
