    "intro": "Epicranthes abbrevilabia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cranesbill, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
