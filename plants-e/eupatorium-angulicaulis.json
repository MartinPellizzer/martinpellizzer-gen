    "intro": "Eupatorium angulicaulis, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rough, angular stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, swamps, and stream banks. Eupatorium angulicaulis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
