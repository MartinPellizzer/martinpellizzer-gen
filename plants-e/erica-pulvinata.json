    "intro": "Erica pulvinata, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing shrub form with hairy, evergreen leaves. Its flowers, which are typically pink or white, bloom in spring and are clustered in racemes. Erica pulvinata is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
