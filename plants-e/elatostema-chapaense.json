    "intro": "Elatostema chapaense, commonly known as the Chapa shield-leaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes plants known for their stinging hairs. The plant features small, shield-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the base, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Elatostema chapaense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
