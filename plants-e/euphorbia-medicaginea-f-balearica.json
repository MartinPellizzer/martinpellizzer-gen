    "intro": "Euphorbia medicaginea f. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Balearic Islands. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient species. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in Mediterranean flora."
