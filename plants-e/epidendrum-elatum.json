    "intro": "Epidendrum elatum, commonly known as the giant flame orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in length, with a vibrant red and orange coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Epidendrum elatum thrives in well-draining potting media and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
