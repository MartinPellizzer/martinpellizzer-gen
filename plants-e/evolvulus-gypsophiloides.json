    "intro": "Evolvulus gypsophiloides, commonly known as the ghostflower or desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, annual herb with hairy stems and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and drought conditions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in arid environments."
