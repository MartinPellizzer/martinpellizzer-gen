    "intro": "Eremopyrum dasyanthum, commonly known as the hairy eremopyrum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Eremopyrum dasyanthum is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall."
