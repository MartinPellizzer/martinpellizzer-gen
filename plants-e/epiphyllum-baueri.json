    "intro": "Epiphyllum baueri, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a flowering plant that typically grows as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, rather than in soil. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Its stems are fleshy and segmented, and it has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure called a phylloide. The plant is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
