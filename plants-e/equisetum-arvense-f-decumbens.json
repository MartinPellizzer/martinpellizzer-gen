    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. decumbens, commonly known as field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, spore-producing cones at the tips of its segmented stems. The plant has a distinctive appearance with hollow, jointed stems and a lack of true leaves. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. This fern is a primitive plant that has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
