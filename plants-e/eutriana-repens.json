It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Eutriana repens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
