    "intro": "Encelia grandiflora, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features yellow-orange flower heads that resemble sunflowers, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Encelia grandiflora is adapted to hot, dry climates and plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
