    "intro": "Echinops multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a distinguishing feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by the development of its distinctive bristly seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Echinops multicaulis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
