    "intro": "Elleanthus escobarii, commonly known as the Escobarii everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Elleanthus escobarii is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun."
