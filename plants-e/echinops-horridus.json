    "intro": "Echinops horridus, commonly known as the thistleweed or desert thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops horridus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and visual appeal."
