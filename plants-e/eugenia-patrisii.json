    "intro": "Eugenia patrisii, commonly known as the Patrisii guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fragrant fruits similar to guavas. Eugenia patrisii thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value and fruit-bearing potential make it a desirable plant in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
