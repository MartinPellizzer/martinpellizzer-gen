It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a ribbed structure with spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Echinopsis rohlandii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
