    "intro": "Eriocephalus pauperrimus, commonly known as the poor man's eriocephalus, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
