    "intro": "Euphorbia quadrispina, commonly known as the four-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy sap. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Euphorbia quadrispina is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments."
