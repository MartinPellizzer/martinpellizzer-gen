    "intro": "Eulophia schaijesii, commonly known as the Schaijes' eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. Eulophia schaijesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
