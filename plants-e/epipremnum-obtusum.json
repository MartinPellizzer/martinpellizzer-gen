    "intro": "Epipremnum obtusum, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically light to dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers warm, humid environments. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and attach to surfaces, making it a popular choice for indoor hanging baskets or trellises. Epipremnum obtusum is relatively low maintenance and can tolerate low light conditions, though it grows best with regular watering and moderate care."
