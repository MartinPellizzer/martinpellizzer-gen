    "intro": "Elymus dasystachys f. glaber, commonly known as the glabrous wild rye, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects. The glabrous (hairless) texture of its leaves distinguishes this subspecies from others in the genus."
