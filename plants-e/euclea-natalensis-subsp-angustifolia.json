    "intro": "Euclea natalensis subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf euclea, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
