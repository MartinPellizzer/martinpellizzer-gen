    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum var. leucocarpum, commonly known as white-fruited crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and distinctive white or pale blue berries. The plant thrives in harsh environments, including tundra and rocky soils, and is adapted to cold climates. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and it produces its characteristic white or pale blue fruits in the fall. This variety is less common than the typical black-fruited form of Empetrum nigrum."
