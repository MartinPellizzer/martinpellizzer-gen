    "intro": "Euphorbia deltoidea subsp. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
