    "intro": "Effusiella convoluta, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped thallus that often forms a dense, cushion-like growth. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions on rocks or soil. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in clusters and aid in vegetative propagation. Effusiella convoluta plays a minor role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for microscopic invertebrates."
