    "intro": "Eleocharis macrantha, commonly known as the tall spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation for various aquatic organisms. Eleocharis macrantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted waters."
