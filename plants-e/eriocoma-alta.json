    "intro": "Eriocoma alta, commonly known as the alpine eriocoma, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant features wiry stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters. Eriocoma alta is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous environments where other plants struggle to survive."
