    "intro": "Epidendrum frigidum, commonly known as the cold epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Central and South America. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight to flourish. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or protected environments."
