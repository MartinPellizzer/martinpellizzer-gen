    "intro": "Eria saccifera, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its unique, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic or lithophytic species, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Eria saccifera thrives in well-drained soil and requires high levels of light and humidity for optimal growth."
