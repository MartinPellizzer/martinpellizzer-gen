    "intro": "Euphorbia potentilloides, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
