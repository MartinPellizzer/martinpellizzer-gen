    "intro": "Epidendrum yasgolgaense, commonly known as the Yasgolga Endless Orchid, is a rare tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can extend up to 30 centimeters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually a mix of white, pink, and purple, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
