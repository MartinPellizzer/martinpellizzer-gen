    "intro": "Euphorbia elongata, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often the only visible part of the inflorescence. Its leaves are alternate and often reduced to small, scale-like structures. Euphorbia elongata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
