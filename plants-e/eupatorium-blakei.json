    "intro": "Eupatorium blakei, commonly known as Blake's boneset, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter leaves. Its scientific name honors William Blake, a 19th-century botanist who contributed to the study of North American flora. Eupatorium blakei is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported fever-reducing properties."
