    "intro": "Epilobium brevifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrowly elliptic with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. Epilobium brevifolium is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
