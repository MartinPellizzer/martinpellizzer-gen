    "intro": "Echinopsis pluriflora, commonly known as the \"Candelabra Cactus,\" is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its multiple branching stems that resemble a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often nocturnal in blooming behavior. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis pluriflora is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
