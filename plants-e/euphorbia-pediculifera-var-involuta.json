    "intro": "Euphorbia pediculifera var. involuta, commonly known as the curled euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, waxy leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
