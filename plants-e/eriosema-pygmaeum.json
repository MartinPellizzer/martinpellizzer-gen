    "intro": "Eriosema pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf eriosema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often clustered in racemes. Eriosema pygmaeum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or woodland habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
