    "intro": "Elaphoglossum subsessile, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure, characteristic of the Elaphoglossum genus. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in distinct patterns. The plant's adaptability to rocky substrates makes it an important component of its ecological niche."
