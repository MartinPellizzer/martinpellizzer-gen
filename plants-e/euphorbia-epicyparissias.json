    "intro": "Euphorbia epicyparissias, commonly known as the white-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, providing a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia epicyparissias is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
