    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus dichroacanthus, commonly known as the dichroacanthus cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, and it produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
