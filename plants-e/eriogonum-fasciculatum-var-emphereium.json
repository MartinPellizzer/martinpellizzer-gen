    "intro": "Eriogonum fasciculatum var. emphereium, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as mountain slopes and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and plays an important role in supporting local pollinators."
