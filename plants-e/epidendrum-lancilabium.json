    "intro": "Epidendrum lancilabium, commonly known as the slender-labium epidendron, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
