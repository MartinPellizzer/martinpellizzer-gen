    "intro": "Eupatorium steetzii var. columbiense, commonly known as the Columbia eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowering period occurs during the summer months. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential use in wetland restoration projects."
