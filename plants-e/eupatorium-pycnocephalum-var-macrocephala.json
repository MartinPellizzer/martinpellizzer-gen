It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, rounded heads. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its showy inflorescences make it a valuable addition to wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
