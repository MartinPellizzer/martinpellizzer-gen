    "intro": "Eremurus hilariae, commonly known as the desert candle, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like flower stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, spiky yellow or orange inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Eremurus hilariae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
