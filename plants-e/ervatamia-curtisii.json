    "intro": "Ervatamia curtisii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Ervatamia curtisii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
