    "intro": "Erica tetralix var. rubra, commonly known as the red heather, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles and parts of Europe. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers, blueberries, and other ericaceous plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, showy red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
