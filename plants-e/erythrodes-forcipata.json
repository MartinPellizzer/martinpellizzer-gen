    "intro": "Erythrodes forcipata, commonly known as the red-stemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. Erythrodes forcipata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
