    "intro": "Eupatorium strobilanthum, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bright red or orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, long-lasting inflorescences. Eupatorium strobilanthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
