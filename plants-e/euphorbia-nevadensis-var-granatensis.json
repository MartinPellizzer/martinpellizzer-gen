    "intro": "Euphorbia nevadensis var. granatensis, commonly known as the granate spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The species is also notable for its toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
