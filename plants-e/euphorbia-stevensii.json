    "intro": "Euphorbia stevensii, commonly known as the Stevens' spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, green stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to dry conditions. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps reduce water loss, making it well-suited for desert climates. Euphorbia stevensii is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
