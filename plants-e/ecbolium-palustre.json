    "intro": "Ecbolium palustre, commonly known as the marsh bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in wetlands and marshy areas. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that help it float and trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has no true roots, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage. Its leaves are typically simple and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ecbolium palustre plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
