    "intro": "Eria carolettae, commonly known as the Caroletta orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces aerial roots that help in absorbing moisture from the air. Eria carolettae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
