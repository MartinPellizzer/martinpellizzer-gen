    "intro": "Epidendrum campylonocturnum, commonly known as the night-blooming epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, nocturnal flowers that open in the evening and close by dawn, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its inflorescence is a spike that bears numerous small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Epidendrum campylonocturnum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
