    "intro": "Echinochloa colonum var. zonalis, commonly known as zonal panicum, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive zonation, where the leaf blades show a striking color contrast between the upper and lower surfaces. The plant typically grows in wet, disturbed soils and is often found in low-lying areas near water. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, with the lower spikelets often being shorter and more compact. Zonal panicum is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
