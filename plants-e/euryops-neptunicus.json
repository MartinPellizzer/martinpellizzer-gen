    "intro": "Euryops neptunicus, commonly known as the sea dandelion, is a coastal plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its root system helps stabilize dunes, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. Euryops neptunicus is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
