    "intro": "Echinops eryngiifolius, commonly known as the spiny globe-thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Echinops. The plant has silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for dry gardens. The flowers, which are typically blue to purple, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
