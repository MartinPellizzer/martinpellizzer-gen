It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular ornamental species in warm climates. Erythrina speciosa also plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with symbiotic root nodules."
