    "intro": "Epidendrum leprosum, commonly known as the Leprous Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum leprosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
