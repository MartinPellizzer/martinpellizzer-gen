    "intro": "Euphorbia taboraensis, commonly known as the Tabora euphorbia, is a shrub native to East Africa, particularly Tanzania. It is characterized by its branching structure and spiny stems, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia taboraensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
