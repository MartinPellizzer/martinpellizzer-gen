    "intro": "Echium flavum subsp. saetabense, commonly known as the narrow-leaved viper's bugloss, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
