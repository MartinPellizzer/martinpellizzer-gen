    "intro": "Effusiella scabrata, commonly known as the roughleaf effusiella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually white or pale green, resembling those of other members of the Apiaceae family. Effusiella scabrata is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
