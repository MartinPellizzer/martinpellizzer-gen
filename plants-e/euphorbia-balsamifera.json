    "intro": "Euphorbia balsamifera, commonly known as the balsam weed, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is known for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
