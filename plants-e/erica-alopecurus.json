    "intro": "Erica alopecurus, commonly known as heath cinquefoil, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the British Isles and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. Erica alopecurus thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
