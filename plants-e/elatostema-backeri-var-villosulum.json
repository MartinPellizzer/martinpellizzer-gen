    "intro": "Elatostema backeri var. villosulum, commonly known as the hairy elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
