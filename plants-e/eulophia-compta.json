    "intro": "Eulophia compta, commonly known as the compact eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Eulophia compta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
