    "intro": "Euphorbia clarkeana, commonly known as the Clarke's spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves, which are typically green and somewhat triangular in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia clarkeana is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, which helps it survive in harsh conditions."
