    "intro": "Eryngium prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with soft, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems and leaves are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Eryngium prostratum is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
