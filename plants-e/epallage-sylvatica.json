    "intro": "Epallage sylvatica, commonly known as the forest epallage, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate forests of East Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Epallage sylvatica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
