    "intro": "Echinocactus wislizeni var. phoeniceus, commonly known as the Queen of the Night cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem covered in prominent, radial spines and woolly areoles. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in arid regions for both ornamental and conservation purposes."
