    "intro": "Elatinoides spartioides, commonly known as the sandbur or seaside sandmat, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Elatinoides spartioides is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
