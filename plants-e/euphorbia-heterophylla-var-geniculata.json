    "intro": "Euphorbia heterophylla var. geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, branching stems that form a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted for water storage, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance."
