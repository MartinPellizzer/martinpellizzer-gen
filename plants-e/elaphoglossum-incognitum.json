    "intro": "Elaphoglossum incognitum, commonly known as the unknown holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Elaphoglossum incognitum is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in tropical and subtropical regions."
