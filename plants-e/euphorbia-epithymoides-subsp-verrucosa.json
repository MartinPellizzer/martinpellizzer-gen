    "intro": "Euphorbia epithymoides subsp. verrucosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine, white hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Euphorbia epithymoides subsp. verrucosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
