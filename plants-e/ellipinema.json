    "intro": "Ellipinema, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods are typically slender and slightly curved. Ellipinema thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
