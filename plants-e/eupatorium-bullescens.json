    "intro": "Eupatorium bullescens, commonly known as the balloonweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, fleshy stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Eupatorium bullescens plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
