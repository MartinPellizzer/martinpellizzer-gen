    "intro": "Euphorbia cybirensis var. microcarpa, commonly known as the miniature spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features compact, rounded growth with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters, known as cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
