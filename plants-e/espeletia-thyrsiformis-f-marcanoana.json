    "intro": "Espeletia thyrsiformis f. marcanoana, commonly known as the Marcanoan heath, is a unique plant species native to the high-altitude grasslands of Colombia. It is characterized by its compact rosette structure and dense clusters of small, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flower heads that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its morphology is adapted to withstand strong winds and intense sunlight typical of its mountainous habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations and ecological significance in cloud forest ecosystems."
