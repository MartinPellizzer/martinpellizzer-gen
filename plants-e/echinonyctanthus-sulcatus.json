    "intro": "Echinonyctanthus sulcatus, commonly known as the zigzag woodbine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a woody vine characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Echinonyctanthus sulcatus is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
