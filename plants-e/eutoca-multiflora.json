    "intro": "Eutoca multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered eutoca, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Eutoca multiflora is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, windy environments."
