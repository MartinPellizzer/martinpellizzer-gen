    "intro": "Euphorbia gillettii subsp. tenuior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
