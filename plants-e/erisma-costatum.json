    "intro": "Erisma costatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf eriska, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, narrow, elliptical leaves that have finely toothed margins. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. Erisma costatum is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its aesthetic appeal in native plant gardens."
