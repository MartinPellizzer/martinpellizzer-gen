    "intro": "Epidendrum tortipetalum, commonly known as the hooked-lobed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescence and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with a waxy surface, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Epidendrum tortipetalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions."
