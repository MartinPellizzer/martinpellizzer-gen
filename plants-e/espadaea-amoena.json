    "intro": "Espadaea amoena, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a pale pink or white hue. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a lush, green backdrop to its ornamental flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat. Espadaea amoena is valued both for its aesthetic appeal and its subtle, intoxicating fragrance."
