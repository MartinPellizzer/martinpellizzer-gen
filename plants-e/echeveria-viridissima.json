    "intro": "Echeveria viridissima, commonly known as the Jade Necklace, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its compact size and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
