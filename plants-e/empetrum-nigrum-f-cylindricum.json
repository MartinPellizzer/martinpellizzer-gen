    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum f. cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical crowberry, is a low-growing shrub belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark blue berries that are typically cylindrical in shape, giving it its specific epithet. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and alpine regions. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature. This form is a naturally occurring variant of the common crowberry, adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
