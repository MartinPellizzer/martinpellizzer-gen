It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and streambanks. The plant has slender, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.
