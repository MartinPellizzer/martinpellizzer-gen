    "intro": "Erodium pilosum var. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky weed or sticky eryngo, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems covered in sticky, glandular hairs that give it its common name. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and also bear the same sticky secretions. Small, white to pale pink flowers appear in clusters, and the plant produces small, hairy fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
