    "intro": "Eriosema macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved eriosema, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
