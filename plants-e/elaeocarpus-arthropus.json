    "intro": "Elaeocarpus arthropus, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by round, leathery fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its root system includes pneumatophores, specialized roots that protrude above the soil to facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
