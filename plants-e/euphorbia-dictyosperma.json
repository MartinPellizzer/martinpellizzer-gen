    "intro": "Euphorbia dictyosperma, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
