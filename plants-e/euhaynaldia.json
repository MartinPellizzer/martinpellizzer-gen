    "intro": "Euhaynaldia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. They are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and parts of Mexico. Euhaynaldia species often grow in woodland or shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil. The foliage is usually lance-shaped with a smooth texture, and the plants are generally herbaceous, though some species may have a slight woody base."
