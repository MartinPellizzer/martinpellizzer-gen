It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a palmate pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces berries that are edible for certain bird species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
