It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Elaphoglossum stenolepis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
