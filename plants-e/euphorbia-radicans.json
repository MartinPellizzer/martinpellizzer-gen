    "intro": "Euphorbia radicans, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, spreading stem that often forms dense mats, with small, rounded leaves that are usually green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Euphorbia radicans is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
