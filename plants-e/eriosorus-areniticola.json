    "intro": "Eriosorus areniticola, commonly known as the sandstone spleenworts, is a member of the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. It is a lithophytic liverwort, meaning it grows on rocks, particularly sandstone, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central stalk and leaf-like structures arranged in a spiral pattern. Its spore-producing capsules are typically borne on short stalks at the tips of the branches. Eriosorus areniticola is often found in coastal or mountainous regions where the substrate is rocky and the climate is moist."
