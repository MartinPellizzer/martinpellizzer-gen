    "intro": "Euphorbia erinacea, commonly known as the \"Cotton Spurge,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a soft, cotton-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Euphorbia erinacea is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
