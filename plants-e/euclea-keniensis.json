    "intro": "Euclea keniensis, commonly known as Kenyan euclea, is a shrub native to East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
