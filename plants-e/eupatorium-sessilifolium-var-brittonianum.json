    "intro": "Eupatorium sessilifolium var. brittonianum, commonly known as the Britton's blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as swamps and woodland edges. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are often covered in fine hairs. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
