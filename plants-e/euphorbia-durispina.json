    "intro": "Euphorbia durispina, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in spiny, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a cautionary plant for horticulturists. Euphorbia durispina is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions."
