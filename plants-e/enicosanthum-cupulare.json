    "intro": "Enicosanthum cupulare, commonly known as the cupular flamecup, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are modified leaves used to attract pollinators. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
