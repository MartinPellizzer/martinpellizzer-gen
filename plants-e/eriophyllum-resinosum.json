    "intro": "Eriophyllum resinosum, commonly known as the resinous goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Eriophyllum resinosum is also noted for its resinous secretions, which can be used in traditional herbal practices."
