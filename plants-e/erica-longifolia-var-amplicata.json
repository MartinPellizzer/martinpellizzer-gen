    "intro": "Erica longifolia var. amplicata, commonly known as the broad-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often broader than those of the typical *Erica longifolia* variety. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in garden settings for its hardy nature and long flowering period."
