    "intro": "Eucalyptus incrassata subsp. costata, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a blue-green hue and prominent veins. It produces creamy-white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
