    "intro": "Euphorbia kraussiana var. erubescens, commonly known as the red-veined euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues, particularly along the veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its striking coloration and unique morphology make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
