It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to submerged soil conditions. Its small, spike-like flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The Ussuri sedge is often found in temperate regions of Asia, including parts of Russia and China."
