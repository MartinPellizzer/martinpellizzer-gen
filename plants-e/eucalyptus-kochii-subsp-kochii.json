    "intro": "Eucalyptus kochii subsp. kochii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The flowers are usually pale yellow and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding insects. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
