    "intro": "Eurybia eryngiifolia, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistles, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and seaside meadows. Eurybia eryngiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
