    "intro": "Eremophila ovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for dry climates. It produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Eremophila ovata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
