    "intro": "Ericoides stylare, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides stylare thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
