    "intro": "Euclea ovata, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Euclea ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
