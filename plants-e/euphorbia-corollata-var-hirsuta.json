    "intro": "Euphorbia corollata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cymes, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats."
