    "intro": "Eriogonum latifolium subsp. auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
