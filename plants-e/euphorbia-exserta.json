    "intro": "Euphorbia exserta, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with its spiky, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is toxic and can cause irritation upon contact. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Euphorbia exserta is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
