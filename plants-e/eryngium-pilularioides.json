    "intro": "Eryngium pilularioides, commonly known as the sand panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small, spiky flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue, and it produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Eryngium pilularioides is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
