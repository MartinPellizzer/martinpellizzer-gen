It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble those of true dandelions. The plant is native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. Entoplocamia species are herbaceous and typically have a short, upright stem. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
