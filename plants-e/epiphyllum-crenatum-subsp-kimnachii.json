    "intro": "Epiphyllum crenatum subsp. kimnachii, commonly known as the Kimnach's night bloomer, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that resemble leaves, which are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically open at night, with bright colors such as pink, red, or white. These flowers are fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The species is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
