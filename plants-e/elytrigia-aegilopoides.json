It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and roadside environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. Elytrigia aegilopoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
