    "intro": "Ericoides gibbosum, commonly known as the cushion heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, adapted to reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. Ericoides gibbosum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various alpine species."
