    "intro": "Erica sessiliflora var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, dense clusters of needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing groundcover in suitable climates."
