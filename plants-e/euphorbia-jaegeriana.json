    "intro": "Euphorbia jaegeriana, commonly known as the Jaeger's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance. However, it contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it."
