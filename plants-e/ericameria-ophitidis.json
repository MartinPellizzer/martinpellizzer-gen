    "intro": "Ericameria ophitidis, commonly known as the desert gum plant, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its small, tubular flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Ericameria ophitidis is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability."
