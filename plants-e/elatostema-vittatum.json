    "intro": "Elatostema vittatum, commonly known as the spotted leaf elatostema, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically has a sprawling habit, with hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role."
