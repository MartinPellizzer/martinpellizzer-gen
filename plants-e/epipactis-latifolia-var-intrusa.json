    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. intrusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears multiple showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, erect stem each year, which is topped with a cluster of flowers. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
