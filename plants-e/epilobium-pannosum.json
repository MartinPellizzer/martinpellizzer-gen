    "intro": "Epilobium pannosum, commonly known as the woolly willow or silky willow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often boggy habitats, such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, usually pink or reddish in color. Epilobium pannosum is known for its ability to thrive in wet environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
