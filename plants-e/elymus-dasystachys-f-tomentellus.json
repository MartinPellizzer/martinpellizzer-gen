    "intro": "Elymus dasystachys f. tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, slender inflorescences with spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and restoration projects."
