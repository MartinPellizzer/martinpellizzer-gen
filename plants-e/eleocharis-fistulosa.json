    "intro": "Eleocharis fistulosa, commonly known as the purple spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spikes of tiny, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along pond edges. Eleocharis fistulosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
