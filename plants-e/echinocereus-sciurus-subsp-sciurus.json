    "intro": "Echinocereus sciurus subsp. sciurus, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
