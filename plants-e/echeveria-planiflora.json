It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or summer. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil and full sun. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
