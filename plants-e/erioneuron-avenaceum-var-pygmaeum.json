    "intro": "Erioneuron avenaceum var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, tufted stems that rarely exceed 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic texture. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
