    "intro": "Elymus angustispiculatus, commonly known as narrow-spike wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
