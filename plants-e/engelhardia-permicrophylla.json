    "intro": "Engelhardia permicrophylla, commonly known as the minute-leafed engelhardia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its extremely small, leathery leaves that are densely packed along its slender, woody stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation research."
