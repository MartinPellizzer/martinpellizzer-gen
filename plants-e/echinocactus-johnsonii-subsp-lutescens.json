    "intro": "Echinocactus johnsonii subsp. lutescens, commonly known as the golden hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, ribbed structure. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections."
