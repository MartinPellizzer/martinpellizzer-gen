    "intro": "Elaphoglossum longistipitatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Elaphoglossum longistipitatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
