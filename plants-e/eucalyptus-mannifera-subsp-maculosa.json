    "intro": "Eucalyptus mannifera subsp. maculosa, commonly known as the spotted mallees, is a small to medium-sized eucalyptus species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive grey-green, lance-shaped leaves with prominent white markings. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The bark is often flaky and peels in thin layers, giving the tree a unique appearance. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions."
