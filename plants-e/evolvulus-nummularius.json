    "intro": "Evolvulus nummularius, commonly known as the dollarweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is considered a weed in some regions."
