    "intro": "Echinopsis multiplex, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and open only during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Echinopsis multiplex is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking appearance."
