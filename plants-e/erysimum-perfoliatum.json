    "intro": "Erysimum perfoliatum, commonly known as the perfoliate wallflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are often clasping around the stem, giving the appearance of the stem passing through the leaf. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Erysimum perfoliatum is a perennial herb that is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
