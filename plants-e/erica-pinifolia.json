    "intro": "Erica pinifolia, commonly known as the needle heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that gives it a pine-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Erica pinifolia thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
