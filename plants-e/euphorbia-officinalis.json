    "intro": "Euphorbia officinalis, commonly known as greater celandine, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a distinctive yellow sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Euphorbia officinalis has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
