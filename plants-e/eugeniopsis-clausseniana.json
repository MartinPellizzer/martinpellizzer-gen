    "intro": "Eugeniopsis clausseniana, commonly known as the Clau\u00dfen's eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other well-known plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, edible berries. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to plant taxonomists."
