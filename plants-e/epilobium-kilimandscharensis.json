    "intro": "Epilobium kilimandscharensis, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro willow, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climates of its native habitat. Epilobium kilimandscharensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
