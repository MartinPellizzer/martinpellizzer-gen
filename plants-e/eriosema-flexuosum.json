    "intro": "Eriosema flexuosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf sarsaparilla, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, velvety appearance. Eriosema flexuosum is often found in grassy areas and along the edges of forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
