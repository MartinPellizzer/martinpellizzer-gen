    "intro": "Echinops candelabrum, commonly known as the candle bush, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of spherical, blue-gray flower heads that resemble candles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Echinops candelabrum is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens for its distinctive appearance and hardy nature."
