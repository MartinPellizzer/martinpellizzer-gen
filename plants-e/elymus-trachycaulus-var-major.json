    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus var. major, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which makes it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or disturbed soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its leaves are narrow, rough-textured, and have a bluish-green color, while its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
