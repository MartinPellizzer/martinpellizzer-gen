    "intro": "Epilobium boreale, commonly known as the Arctic willow or northern willow, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Epilobium boreale is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
