    "intro": "Erica tetralix var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh, acidic habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. This variety is notable for its smooth, hairless appearance compared to other Erica species, which often have more prominent pubescence."
