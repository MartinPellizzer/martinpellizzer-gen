It is characterized by its striking red stems that become prominent in winter, along with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The species is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases."
