    "intro": "Eulophia elisabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's eulophia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and help store water and nutrients, adapting it to its moist, tropical habitat. Eulophia elisabethae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
