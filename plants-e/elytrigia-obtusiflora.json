    "intro": "Elytrigia obtusiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. Elytrigia obtusiflora is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and disturbed sites. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil stability."
