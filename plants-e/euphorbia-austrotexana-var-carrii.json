    "intro": "Euphorbia austrotexana var. carrii, commonly known as the Carr's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences, often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic common in many euphorbias. This species is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
