It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and grasslands. The plant has gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry conditions. Eriogonum saurinum plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various desert wildlife species."
