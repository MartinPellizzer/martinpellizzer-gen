    "intro": "Epidendrum fragrans var. aemulum, commonly known as the fragrant epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps it retain water. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique floral scent."
