    "intro": "Epallage buchwaldii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has a succulent, branching stem and produces small, scale-like leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Epallage buchwaldii is well-suited to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
