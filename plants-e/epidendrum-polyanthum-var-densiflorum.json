    "intro": "Epidendrum polyanthum var. densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous pseudobulbs and elongated leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often blooming multiple times a year. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
