    "intro": "Epidendrum tripetaloides, commonly known as the Three-lobed Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers feature three prominent petals and a spurred lip, which is a common trait among many orchid species. Epidendrum tripetaloides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
