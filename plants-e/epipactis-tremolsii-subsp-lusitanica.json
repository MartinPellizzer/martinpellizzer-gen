    "intro": "Epipactis tremolsii subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces intricate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
