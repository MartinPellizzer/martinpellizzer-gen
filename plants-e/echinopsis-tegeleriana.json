    "intro": "Echinopsis tegeleriana, commonly known as the White Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly during rare rains. Echinopsis tegeleriana is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
