It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Eclipta integrifolia is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open fields."
