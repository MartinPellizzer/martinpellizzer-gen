    "intro": "Ervum cochinchinense, commonly known as the Vietnamese cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often grown for its nutritional seeds, which are rich in protein. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, and it has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Ervum cochinchinense is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other crops when grown in rotation."
