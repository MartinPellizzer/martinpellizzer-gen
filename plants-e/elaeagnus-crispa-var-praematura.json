    "intro": "Elaeagnus crispa var. praematura, commonly known as early silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has a dense, sprawling growth habit and is often used as a hedge or ornamental plant due to its hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The leaves are often covered in a fine, white powder, which gives the plant its distinctive appearance."
