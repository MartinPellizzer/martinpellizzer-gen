    "intro": "Echinocereus chloranthus var. neocapillus, commonly known as the blue prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its blue-green stems and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its succulent structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
