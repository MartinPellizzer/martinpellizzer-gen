    "intro": "Epipetrum humile, commonly known as the silver bush or silver spider plant, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, silver-white leaves that form a compact, bushy appearance. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Epipetrum humile is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
