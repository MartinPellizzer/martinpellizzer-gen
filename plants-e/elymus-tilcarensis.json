    "intro": "Elymus tilcarensis, commonly known as the Tibetan wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including Tibet, China, and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Elymus tilcarensis is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its resilience to harsh climatic conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
