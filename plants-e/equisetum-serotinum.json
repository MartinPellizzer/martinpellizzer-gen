    "intro": "Equisetum serotinum, commonly known as the late spikerush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and the presence of both sterile and fertile stems. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its spore-producing cones are borne on the upper part of the plant, and it lacks true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures. Equisetum serotinum is a relict species that has remained relatively unchanged since the Paleozoic era."
