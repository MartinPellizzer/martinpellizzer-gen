    "intro": "Euphorbia pithyusa subsp. cupanii, commonly known as the Cape coral tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually small and alternate, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
