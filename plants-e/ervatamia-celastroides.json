    "intro": "Ervatamia celastroides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods. Ervatamia celastroides is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
