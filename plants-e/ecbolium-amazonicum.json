    "intro": "Ecbolium amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
