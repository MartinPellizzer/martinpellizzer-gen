    "intro": "Euphorbia monteiroi subsp. monteiroi, commonly known as the Monteiro's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Brazil. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for drought tolerance. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and resilience."
