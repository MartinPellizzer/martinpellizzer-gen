    "intro": "Elaeocarpus kontumensis, commonly known as the Kontum elaeocarpus, is a tropical tree native to the Central Highlands of Vietnam. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds, typical of the genus Elaeocarpus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
