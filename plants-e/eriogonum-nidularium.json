    "intro": "Eriogonum nidularium, commonly known as the clustered buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum nidularium is an important plant for pollinators and is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
