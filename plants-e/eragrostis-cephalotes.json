    "intro": "Eragrostis cephalotes, commonly known as the panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Eragrostis cephalotes is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
