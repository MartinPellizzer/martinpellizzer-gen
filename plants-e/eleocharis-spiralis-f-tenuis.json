    "intro": "Eleocharis spiralis f. tenuis, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight sheathing base, characteristic of many sedges. This variety is distinguished by its reduced, elongated inflorescence compared to the typical form of Eleocharis spiralis."
