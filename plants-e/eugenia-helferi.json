    "intro": "Eugenia helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's clove, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers. The fruit, which is a capsule, contains several small, hard seeds. It is often grown for its ornamental value and has a mild clove-like scent, though it is not as widely used in culinary applications as other eugenia species."
