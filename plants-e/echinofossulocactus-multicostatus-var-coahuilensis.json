    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus multicostatus var. coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuiltecan echinofossulocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are ribbed and often covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
