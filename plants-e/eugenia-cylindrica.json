    "intro": "Eugenia cylindrica, commonly known as the slender guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, smooth, and often scaly bark, which gives it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, pinkish-red fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas. Eugenia cylindrica thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat."
