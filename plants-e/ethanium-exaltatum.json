It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of vibrant red, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure attracts pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees, making it an important species in its ecosystem.
