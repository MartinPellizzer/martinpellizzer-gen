    "intro": "Eria gladiata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host, while its fronds can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Eria gladiata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
