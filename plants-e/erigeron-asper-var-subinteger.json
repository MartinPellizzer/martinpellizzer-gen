It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and prairies. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought."
