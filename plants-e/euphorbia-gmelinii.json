    "intro": "Euphorbia gmelinii, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves. Euphorbia gmelinii is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
