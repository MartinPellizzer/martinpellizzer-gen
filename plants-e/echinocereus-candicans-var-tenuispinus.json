    "intro": "Echinocereus candicans var. tenuispinus, commonly known as the narrow-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and sparse, sharp spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and bats. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
