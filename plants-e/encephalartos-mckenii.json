    "intro": "Encephalartos mckenii, commonly known as the McKenney's cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid and green. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
