    "intro": "Eriochloa michauxii var. simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's false brome, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. This variety is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
