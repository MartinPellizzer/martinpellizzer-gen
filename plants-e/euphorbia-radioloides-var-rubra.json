It features a branched stem system with short, thick, and fleshy stems that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is drought-tolerant. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
