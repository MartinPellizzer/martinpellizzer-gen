    "intro": "Eriocaulon meenachilense, commonly known as the Meenachil River grass, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving streams and rivers. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in dense spikes at the top of the stems. Eriocaulon meenachilense plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
