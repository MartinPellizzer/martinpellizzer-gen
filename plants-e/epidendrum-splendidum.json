    "intro": "Epidendrum splendidum, commonly known as the splendid orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in dry periods, while its long, strap-like leaves are adapted for photosynthesis in shaded conditions. Epidendrum splendidum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
