It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a green alga, which provides nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on bark and soil in forested areas, particularly in temperate regions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and cryptic species."
