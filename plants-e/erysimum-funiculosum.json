    "intro": "Erysimum funiculosum, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with a root system that attaches to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, though it can be a challenge for agricultural crops."
