    "intro": "Erica crenata, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Erica crenata is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native insects and birds."
