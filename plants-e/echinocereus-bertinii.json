    "intro": "Echinocereus bertinii, commonly known as the golden needle cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in spines and have a distinctive golden or yellowish hue. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
