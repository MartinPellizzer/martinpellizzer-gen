    "intro": "Espeletia pannosa, commonly known as the \"P\u00e1ramo espeletia,\" is a striking plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant typically grows in open, rocky areas and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes. Its rosette structure and silver-green leaves are features that aid in reducing water loss and protecting against intense UV radiation. Espeletia pannosa plays an important ecological role in these unique habitats, supporting local biodiversity and contributing to soil stability."
