    "intro": "Erythrodes chinensis var. triantherae, commonly known as the Chinese redflower orchid, is a rare and ornamental orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit, making it a desirable specimen for botanical gardens and collectors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
