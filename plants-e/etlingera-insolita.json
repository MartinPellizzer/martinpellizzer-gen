    "intro": "Etlingera insolita, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long and narrow, often spiraling around its stem, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Etlingera insolita is considered a vulnerable species."
