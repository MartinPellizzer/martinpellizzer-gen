    "intro": "Euphorbia insulana subsp. typica, commonly known as the Socotra candelabra, is a succulent plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its branched, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its unique morphology, including its spiny stems and distinctive shape, makes it a striking example of adaptive evolution. Euphorbia insulana subsp. typica is also notable for its medicinal properties and is considered a flagship species of Socotra's unique biodiversity."
