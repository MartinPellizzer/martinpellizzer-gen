    "intro": "Elaphoglossum firmum, commonly known as the firm fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and densely veined. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Elaphoglossum firmum thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its small, clustered spore-producing structures are an important feature for its reproductive cycle."
