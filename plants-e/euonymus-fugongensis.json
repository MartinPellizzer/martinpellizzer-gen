    "intro": "Euonymus fugongensis, commonly known as the Fugong euonymus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cercidifolium. It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan Province, where it thrives in mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a distinct shape and arrangement that sets it apart from other euonymus species. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Euonymus fugongensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
