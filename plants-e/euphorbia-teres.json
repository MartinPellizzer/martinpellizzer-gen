    "intro": "Euphorbia teres, commonly known as the compact euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are often green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique floral structures, typically appearing in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Euphorbia teres is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact form and resilience."
