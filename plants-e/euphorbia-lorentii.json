    "intro": "Euphorbia lorentii, commonly known as the Lorentz's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
