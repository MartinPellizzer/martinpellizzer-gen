    "intro": "Epilobium pyrricholophum, commonly known as the purple-flowered willow herb, is a flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, often calcareous soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
