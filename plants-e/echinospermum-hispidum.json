    "intro": "Echinospermum hispidum, commonly known as the hairy echinosperm, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or brown, and it produces small, spiny fruits known as achenes. Echinospermum hispidum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid conditions."
