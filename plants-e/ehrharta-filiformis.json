It features fine, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive silvery-blue appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in some regions for landscaping purposes."
