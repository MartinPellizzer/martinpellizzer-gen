    "intro": "Euphorbia huanchahana, commonly known as the Huancayo spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Peruvian Andes. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
