    "intro": "Echinopsis oxygona f. multiplex, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a fascinating cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of bright pink to red flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant features a spiny, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening at night and closing by dawn, a trait common among nocturnal bloomers. This variety is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
