    "intro": "Euphorbia conferta, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It contains a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Euphorbia conferta is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
