    "intro": "Euphorbia limaensis, commonly known as the Lima euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Peru. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils. Its leaves are typically small and often reduced to spines, reducing water loss. Euphorbia limaensis is often found in coastal dunes and is well-suited to full sun exposure."
