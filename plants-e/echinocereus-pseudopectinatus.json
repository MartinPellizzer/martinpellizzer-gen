    "intro": "Echinocereus pseudopectinatus, commonly known as the desert nightblooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant has a ribbed structure with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections."
