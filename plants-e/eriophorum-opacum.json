    "intro": "Eriophorum opacum, commonly known as the woolly cotton-grass, is a herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance, with white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Eriophorum opacum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold, harsh environment."
