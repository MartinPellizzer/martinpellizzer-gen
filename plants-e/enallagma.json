    "intro": "Enallagma, commonly known as the jewelwing damselfly, is a genus of aquatic insects belonging to the family Coenagrionidae. These insects are characterized by their delicate, iridescent wings and elongated bodies, often displaying vibrant colors such as blues, greens, and purples. Enallagma species are typically found near freshwater habitats like ponds, streams, and marshes, where they lay their eggs in aquatic vegetation. Their life cycle involves aquatic larval stages followed by adult emergence, making them important indicators of water quality. The genus is widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, with many species exhibiting distinct regional variations."
