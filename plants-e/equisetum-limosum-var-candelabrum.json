    "intro": "Equisetum limosum var. candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, unbranched stems that resemble a candlestick. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are typically found in the spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica is also notable."
