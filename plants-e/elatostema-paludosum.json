    "intro": "Elatostema paludosum, commonly known as the swamp elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it an important species in marsh and swamp ecosystems. Elatostema paludosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
