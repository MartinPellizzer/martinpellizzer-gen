It features compact growth with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers with prominent central disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
