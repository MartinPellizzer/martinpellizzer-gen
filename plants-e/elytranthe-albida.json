    "intro": "Elytranthe albida, commonly known as the white leaved sunflower, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the family. Its leaves are usually white or pale green, which helps in reflecting sunlight and reducing water loss. Elytranthe albida is often found in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun conditions."
