    "intro": "Erythroxylum microphyllum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by elliptical, bright red berries. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. This variety is closely related to other coca species and is often cultivated for its leaves, which contain alkaloids."
