    "intro": "Elaeocarpus barnardii, commonly known as the Cape York elaeocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of the unique flora of the region and its adaptation to the humid, subtropical climate."
