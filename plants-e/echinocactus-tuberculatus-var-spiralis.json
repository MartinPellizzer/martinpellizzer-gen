    "intro": "Echinocactus tuberculatus var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered in prominent, spirally arranged spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and unique form make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
