    "intro": "Eragrostis terrestris, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
