    "intro": "Erophila vulgaris subsp. majuscula, commonly known as the greater water clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, floating leaves that are divided into small, oval-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its presence often indicates good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
