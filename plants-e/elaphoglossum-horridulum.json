    "intro": "Elaphoglossum horridulum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive rough texture on the underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum horridulum is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
