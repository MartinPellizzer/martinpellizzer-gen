    "intro": "Eucalyptus sabulosa, commonly known as the sandplain eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green or yellow in color. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathlands. Eucalyptus sabulosa plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various native animals."
