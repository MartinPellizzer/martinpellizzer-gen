    "intro": "Eucalyptus exilis, commonly known as the slender ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or grey. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus exilis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands. Its growth habit and appearance make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native habitat."
