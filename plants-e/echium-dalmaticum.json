    "intro": "Echium dalmaticum, commonly known as the Dalmatian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial that typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall. The plant features silvery-gray, woolly leaves and produces striking blue or purple flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
