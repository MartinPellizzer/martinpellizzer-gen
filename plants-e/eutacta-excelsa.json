    "intro": "Eutacta excelsa, commonly known as the giant lily or the sacred lily, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in the world. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Eutacta excelsa is also notable for its cultural significance, often revered in local traditions and rituals."
