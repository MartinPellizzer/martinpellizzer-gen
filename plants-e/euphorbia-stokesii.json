    "intro": "Euphorbia stokesii, commonly known as Stokes' spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, a common adaptation in arid climates. Euphorbia stokesii is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
