It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often slightly wavy in appearance. This plant thrives in freshwater environments and is often found in slow-moving rivers and ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense underwater mats. It is popular in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
