    "intro": "Epidendrum caesaris, commonly known as Caesar's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like flower spikes that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers. Epidendrum caesaris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
