    "intro": "Eriocaulon rupestre, commonly known as the rock rush, is a small, perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a fine, velvety coating, which helps reduce water loss.
