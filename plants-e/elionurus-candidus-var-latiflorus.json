    "intro": "Elionurus candidus var. latiflorus, commonly known as the broadflowered whitegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in sandy or disturbed soils. It is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in low-maintenance garden settings."
