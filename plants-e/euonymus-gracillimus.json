    "intro": "Euonymus gracillimus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. It is often used in landscaping for its dense, compact growth and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for ground cover."
