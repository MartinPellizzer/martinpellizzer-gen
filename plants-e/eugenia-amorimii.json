    "intro": "Eugenia amorimii, commonly known as the Amorim's eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
