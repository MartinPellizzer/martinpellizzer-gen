    "intro": "Encyclia rosariensis, commonly known as the Rosary Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces racemes of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Encyclia rosariensis has a pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry habitat. Its unique floral morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
