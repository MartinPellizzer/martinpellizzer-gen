    "intro": "Euonymus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf euonymus, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Euonymus pygmaeus is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases."
