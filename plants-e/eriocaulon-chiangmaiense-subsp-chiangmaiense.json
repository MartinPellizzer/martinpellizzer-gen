    "intro": "Eriocaulon chiangmaiense subsp. chiangmaiense, commonly known as the Chiang Mai sedge, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually green and covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are adapted for water dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
