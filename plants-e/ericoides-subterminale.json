    "intro": "Ericoides subterminale, commonly known as the slender ericoid, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped white flowers in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
