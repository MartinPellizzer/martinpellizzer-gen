    "intro": "Epilobium oligodontum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are small, pinkish to purple, and arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Epilobium oligodontum is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich habitats and is sometimes considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
