It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and stream edges. The plant has tiny, clustered leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in wet environments make it a common indicator of moist habitats. Elatine spuria is also known for its ability to tolerate pollution, making it a useful species for ecological studies."
