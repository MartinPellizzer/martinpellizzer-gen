    "intro": "Ecuadendron acosta-solisianum, commonly known as the Acosta-Solisian ecuadendron, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
