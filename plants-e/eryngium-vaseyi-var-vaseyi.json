    "intro": "Eryngium vaseyi var. vaseyi, commonly known as the vaseyi thistle, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and striking purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, well-drained environments. Its flowering stems are often branched and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
