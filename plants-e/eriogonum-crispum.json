    "intro": "Eriogonum crispum, commonly known as the curlyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Eriogonum crispum plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
