    "intro": "Erysimum trichophyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Erysimum trichophyllum is known for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in temperate climates."
