    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 maltei, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Elymus trachylobus and Elymus farctus. It is characterized by its tall, robust growth and is often found in disturbed soils across the western United States. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It is notable for its high biomass production and potential use in forage and bioenergy applications. Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds, which limits its natural spread but makes it valuable for cultivation purposes."
