    "intro": "Elsholtzia fruticosa var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved elsholtzia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrifolia has smoother foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes in arid environments."
