    "intro": "Erophila vulgaris var. muricola, commonly known as the rough false flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in wet meadows, ditches, and along riverbanks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
