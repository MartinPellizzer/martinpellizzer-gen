    "intro": "Euphorbia vahliana, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are usually spiny and alternate along the stem, providing additional protection from herbivores. Euphorbia vahliana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
