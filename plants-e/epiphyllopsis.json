    "intro": "Epiphyllopsis, commonly known as the leafy liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that often form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Epiphyllopsis lacks true roots, stems, and vascular tissue, relying on direct absorption of water and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Its simple morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to low-light, humid habitats."
