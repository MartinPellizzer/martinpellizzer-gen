It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features broad, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its foliage and floral structure make it an attractive choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation."
