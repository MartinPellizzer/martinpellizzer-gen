    "intro": "Euphorbia duvalii, commonly known as the Duval's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures, often mistaken for flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Euphorbia duvalii is also noted for its ability to store water in its stems, aiding in its survival in dry environments."
