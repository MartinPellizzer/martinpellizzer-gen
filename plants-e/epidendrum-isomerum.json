    "intro": "Epidendrum isomerum, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically fragrant and bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epidendrum isomerum is considered a conservation concern."
