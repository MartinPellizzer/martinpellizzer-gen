    "intro": "Eupatorium frustratum, commonly known as roughleaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant is often mistaken for other members of the Asteraceae family due to its similar floral structure."
