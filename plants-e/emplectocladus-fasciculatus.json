    "intro": "Emplectocladus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit. The plant features scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged around the stems, giving it a compact appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the plant's spores. Emplectocladus fasciculatus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
