    "intro": "Ephedra alata subsp. monjauzeana, commonly known as the narrowleaf ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of northern Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and scale-like leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in rocky soils or along dry riverbeds. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. However, due to its alkaloid content, it is also considered a controlled substance in many regions."
