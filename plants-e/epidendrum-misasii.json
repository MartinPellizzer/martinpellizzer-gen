    "intro": "Epidendrum misasii, commonly known as the Misasii Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves. The plant produces inflorescences with numerous showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid forest floor, and it thrives in shaded, well-draining environments. Epidendrum misasii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
