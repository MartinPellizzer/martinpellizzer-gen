    "intro": "Ecdysanthera quintaretii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, pale green, translucent leaves and its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for aerial growth. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ecdysanthera quintaretii is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
