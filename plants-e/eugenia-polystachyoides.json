    "intro": "Eugenia polystachyoides, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant is well adapted to saline and windy conditions, making it a characteristic species of coastal ecosystems."
