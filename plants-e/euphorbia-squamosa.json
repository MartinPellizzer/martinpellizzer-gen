    "intro": "Euphorbia squamosa, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
