It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
