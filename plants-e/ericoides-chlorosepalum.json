    "intro": "Ericoides chlorosepalum, commonly known as the yellow-sepal ericoid, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland or rocky habitats. Its sepals are notably yellow, giving it its common name, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
