    "intro": "Echinocereus centralis, commonly known as the Central prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white, powdery bloom. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp. Echinocereus centralis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
