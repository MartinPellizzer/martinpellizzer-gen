    "intro": "Eria agathodaemonis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with three petals and three sepals that are often fused at the base. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Eria agathodaemonis is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
