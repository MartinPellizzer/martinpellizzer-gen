It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it grows in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Erica schmidtii is evergreen, with dense, compact foliage that forms a low-growing shrub. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, requiring minimal water once established."
