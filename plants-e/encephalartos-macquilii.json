    "intro": "Encephalartos macquilii, commonly known as the MacQuil's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the cycad family, which has existed since the time of the dinosaurs. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Encephalartos macquilii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
