    "intro": "Ehrharta undulata var. calycina, commonly known as the California bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime chaparral habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal vegetation. Due to its ecological significance, it is often used in restoration projects to stabilize dune ecosystems."
