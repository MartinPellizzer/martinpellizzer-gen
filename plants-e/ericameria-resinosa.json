    "intro": "Ericameria resinosa, commonly known as the sticky goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its resinous secretions have historically been used by indigenous peoples for medicinal and practical purposes. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
