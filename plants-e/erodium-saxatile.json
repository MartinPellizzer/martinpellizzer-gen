It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in gravelly or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments."
