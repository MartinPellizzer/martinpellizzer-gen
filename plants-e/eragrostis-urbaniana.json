It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Eragrostis urbaniana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
