    "intro": "Eugenioides adenopus, commonly known as the velvetleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clumps with a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its leaves are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. Eugenioides adenopus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
