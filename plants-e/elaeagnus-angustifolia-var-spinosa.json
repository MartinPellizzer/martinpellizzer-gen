    "intro": "Elaeagnus angustifolia var. spinosa, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and thorny branches, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by reddish or purplish berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. This species is also valued for its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
