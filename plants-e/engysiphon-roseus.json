    "intro": "Engysiphon roseus, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and vibrant red petals that resemble those of a rose, hence its common name. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a delicate, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, Engysiphon roseus is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and conservationists."
