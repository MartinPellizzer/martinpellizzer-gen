    "intro": "Echeveria crenulata, commonly known as the crinkled echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, crinkled leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces showy clusters of violet or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
