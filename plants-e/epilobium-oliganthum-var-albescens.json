It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
