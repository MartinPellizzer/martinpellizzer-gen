    "intro": "Elymus angustus, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in dense clusters, with small, awned flowers that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Elymus angustus is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
