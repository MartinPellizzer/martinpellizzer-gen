    "intro": "Evax longilanata, commonly known as the long-leaf evax, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Evax longilanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
