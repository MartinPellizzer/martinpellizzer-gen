    "intro": "Epithelantha cryptica, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate cactus species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its small, pale green stems that are covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming at night. Epithelantha cryptica is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
