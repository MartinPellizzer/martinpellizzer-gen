    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ciliatosquama, commonly known as the hairy-fringed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely toothed margins and a hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
