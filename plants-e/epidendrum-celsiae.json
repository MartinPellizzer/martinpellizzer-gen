    "intro": "Epidendrum celsiae, commonly known as the Celsia orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, hanging inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are elliptical and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Epidendrum celsiae prefers bright, indirect light and consistent humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
