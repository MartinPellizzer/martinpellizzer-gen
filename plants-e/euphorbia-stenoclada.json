    "intro": "Euphorbia stenoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-like structures containing tiny yellow flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia stenoclada is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance."
