    "intro": "Euphorbia glyptosperma, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine. Euphorbia glyptosperma is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments."
