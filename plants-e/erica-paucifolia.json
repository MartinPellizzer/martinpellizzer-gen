    "intro": "Erica paucifolia, commonly known as the Heath Erica, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces delicate white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica paucifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in Mediterranean climates."
