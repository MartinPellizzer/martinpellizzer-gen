    "intro": "Eriocycla albescens, commonly known as the white sand dollar, is a small, annual plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, white or pale green leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of dry, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
