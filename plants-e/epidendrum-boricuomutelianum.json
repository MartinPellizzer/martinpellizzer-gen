    "intro": "Epidendrum boricuomutelianum, commonly known as the Boriquero orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple with a yellow throat, arranged in racemes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
