    "intro": "Echinopsis santaensis, commonly known as the Santa Elena cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has spiny areoles and produces small, ribbed fruits that contain seeds. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick stem and having a shallow root system. Echinopsis santaensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry environments."
