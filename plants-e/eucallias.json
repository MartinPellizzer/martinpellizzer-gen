    "intro": "Eucallias, commonly known as false dandelions, are flowering plants belonging to the Asteraceae family. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and showy yellow or white composite flowers. These plants are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in dry, open habitats. Eucallias have a fibrous root system and produce small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. They are generally hardy and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
