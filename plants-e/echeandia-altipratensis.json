    "intro": "Echeandia altipratensis, commonly known as the high plains centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, blue to violet flowers in the summer months. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
