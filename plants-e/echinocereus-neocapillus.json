    "intro": "Echinocereus neocapillus, commonly known as the desert night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can grow up to 6 feet tall. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through shade and air movement."
