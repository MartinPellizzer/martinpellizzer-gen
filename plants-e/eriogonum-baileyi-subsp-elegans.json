    "intro": "Eriogonum baileyi subsp. elegans, commonly known as the Bailey's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its soft, hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
