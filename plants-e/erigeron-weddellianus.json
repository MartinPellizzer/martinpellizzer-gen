    "intro": "Erigeron weddellianus, commonly known as Weddell's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
