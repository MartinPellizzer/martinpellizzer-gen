    "intro": "Epidendrum ancipitinocturnum, commonly known as the night-blooming epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. The leaves are usually dark green and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and efficient water retention."
