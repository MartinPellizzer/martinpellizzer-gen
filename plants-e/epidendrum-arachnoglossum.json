    "intro": "Epidendrum arachnoglossum, commonly known as the spider-tongue orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, thin, and often hairy stems, which can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
