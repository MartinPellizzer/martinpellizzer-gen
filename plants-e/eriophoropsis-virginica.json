    "intro": "Eriophoropsis virginica, commonly known as the Virginia eriophoropsis, is a small, annual plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
