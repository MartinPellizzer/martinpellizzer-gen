    "intro": "Euphorbia sarcoceras, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine. Euphorbia sarcoceras is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments."
