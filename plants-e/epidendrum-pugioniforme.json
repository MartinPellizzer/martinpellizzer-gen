    "intro": "Epidendrum pugioniforme, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Epidendrum pugioniforme is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
