    "intro": "Euphorbia wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western Himalayas. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
