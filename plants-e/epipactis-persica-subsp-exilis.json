    "intro": "Epipactis persica subsp. exilis, commonly known as the slender Persian helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
