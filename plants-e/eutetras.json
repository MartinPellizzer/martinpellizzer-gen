It is characterized by its distinctive four leaves, which are often considered a symbol of good luck. The plant is a low-growing herb with small white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its rarity, Eutetras is often sought after in botanical gardens and by collectors."
