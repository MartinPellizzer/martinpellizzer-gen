    "intro": "Eucalyptus nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small white or pale pink flowers, typically in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Eucalyptus nervosa is often found in heathlands and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. It is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
