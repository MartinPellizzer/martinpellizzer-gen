It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and historical significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
