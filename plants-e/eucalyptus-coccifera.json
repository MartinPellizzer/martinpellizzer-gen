    "intro": "Eucalyptus coccifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern Australia and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often forming dense thickets in dry, sandy soils. It is well adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and have also been studied for their potential aromatic and medicinal properties."
