    "intro": "Euphlebium decoratum, commonly known as the ornate euphlebium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphlebiaceae and is characterized by its striking, intricate floral structures. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along its slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Euphlebium decoratum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
