    "intro": "Eupatorium rotundifolium var. pubescens, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are round or heart-shaped with toothed margins and are also covered in fine pubescence. It is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks."
