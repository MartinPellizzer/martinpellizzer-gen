    "intro": "Elemifera maritima, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Elemifera maritima plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting coastal biodiversity."
