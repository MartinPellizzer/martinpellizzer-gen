    "intro": "Eucalyptus amygdalina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus amygdalina is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, have been used in traditional and modern medicine for their antimicrobial and respiratory benefits."
