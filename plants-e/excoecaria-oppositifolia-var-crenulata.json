    "intro": "Excoecaria oppositifolia var. crenulata, commonly known as the crested mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often lobed leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant thrives in brackish or saline water environments, typically found in coastal areas and estuaries. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss and withstand salt exposure, making it well-suited for tidal zones. The plant plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
