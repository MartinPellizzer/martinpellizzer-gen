    "intro": "Enemion, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces showy, yellow or white flowers in early spring. The plant has palmately divided leaves and is native to North America, particularly in the eastern and central regions. Enemion thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woods, meadows, and along roadsides. It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
