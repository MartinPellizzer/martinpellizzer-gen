    "intro": "Epidendrum nitens, commonly known as the silver epiphyte, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires good air circulation. Epidendrum nitens is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
