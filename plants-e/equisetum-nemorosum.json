    "intro": "Equisetum nemorosum, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
