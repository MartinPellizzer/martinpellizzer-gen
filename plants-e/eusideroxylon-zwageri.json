    "intro": "Eusideroxylon zwageri, commonly known as the African teak, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to overexploitation, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
