    "intro": "Epidendrum cuniculatum, commonly known as the rabbit's foot orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that resembles rabbit fur, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Epidendrum cuniculatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
