    "intro": "Ephedra fragilis var. wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's Ephedra, is a species of gymnosperm native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain the alkaloid ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been the subject of both scientific study and conservation efforts."
