It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are small, dark purple berries that contain several seeds. This species is adapted to sandy soils and saline environments, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems."
