    "intro": "Eriocaulon nautiliformoides var. nautiliformoides, commonly known as the nautiliformoides rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its distinctive, spiral-shaped inflorescences that resemble a nautilus shell, giving it its unique common name."
