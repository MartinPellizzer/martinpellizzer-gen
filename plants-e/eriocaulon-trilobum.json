    "intro": "Eriocaulon trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed marsh plant, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a three-lobed appearance, giving it its common name. Eriocaulon trilobum is noted for its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
