    "intro": "Eleutheroglossum, commonly known as the \"scentless orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plants are characterized by their unique, often fragrant or scentless flowers, which are typically small and clustered. Eleutheroglossum species have pseudobulbs and produce showy, often brightly colored blooms that attract pollinators. Due to their ornamental value and habitat specificity, some species are considered rare or endangered."
