    "intro": "Elaphoglossum elkeae, commonly known as the Elke's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum elkeae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
