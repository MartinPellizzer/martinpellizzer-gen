    "intro": "Epidendrum sterrophyllum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and in shaded forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
