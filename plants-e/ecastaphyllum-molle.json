    "intro": "Ecastaphyllum molle, commonly known as the soft ecastaphyllum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically evergreen, glossy, and arranged in a compact rosette pattern. Ecastaphyllum molle is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
