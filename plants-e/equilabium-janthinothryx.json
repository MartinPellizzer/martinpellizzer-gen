    "intro": "Equilabium janthinothryx, commonly known as the purple star orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant purple petals and a distinctive star-shaped floral structure, which sets it apart from other orchid species. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers typically bloom during the late spring and early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Equilabium janthinothryx is considered a conservation concern."
