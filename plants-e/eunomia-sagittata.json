    "intro": "Eunomia sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves, which are typically heart to arrowhead in form, and its clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Eunomia sagittata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
