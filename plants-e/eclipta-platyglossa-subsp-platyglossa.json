    "intro": "Eclipta platyglossa subsp. platyglossa, commonly known as the broad-leaved false dandelion, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind. The species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
