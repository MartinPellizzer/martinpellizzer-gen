    "intro": "Elymus pauciflorus subsp. laevis, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control or as a forage plant."
