    "intro": "Euphorbia platyrrhiza, commonly known as the broad-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
