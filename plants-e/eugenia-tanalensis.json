    "intro": "Eugenia tanalensis, commonly known as the Malabar cherry, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of southern India and Sri Lanka. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, edible berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. The berries are valued for their tart flavor and are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
