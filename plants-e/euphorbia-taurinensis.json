    "intro": "Euphorbia taurinensis, commonly known as the Taurine spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southern Caucasus region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
