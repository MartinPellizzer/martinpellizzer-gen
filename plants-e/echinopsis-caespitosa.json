    "intro": "Echinopsis caespitosa, commonly known as the rock cactus or night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and blooming habits, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
