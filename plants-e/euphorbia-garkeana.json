    "intro": "Euphorbia garkeana, commonly known as the Karoo euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, and its growth habit makes it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
