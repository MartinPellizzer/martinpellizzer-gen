    "intro": "Epidendrum cochlidium, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically blooms during the cooler months, often in response to seasonal changes in light and temperature. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Epidendrum cochlidium is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and relatively low maintenance requirements."
