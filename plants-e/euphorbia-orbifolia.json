    "intro": "Euphorbia orbifolia, commonly known as the orb-shaped spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often rounded or orb-like in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
