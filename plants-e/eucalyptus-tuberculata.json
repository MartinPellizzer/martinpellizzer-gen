    "intro": "Eucalyptus tuberculata, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in thin, flaky strips. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, raised oil glands. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is valued for its aromatic foliage and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
