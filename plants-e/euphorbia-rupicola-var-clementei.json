It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is noted for its resilience and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
