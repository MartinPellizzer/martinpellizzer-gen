    "intro": "Epidendrum benignum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Epidendrum benignum is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
