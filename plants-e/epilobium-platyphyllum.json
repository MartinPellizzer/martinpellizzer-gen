    "intro": "Epilobium platyphyllum, commonly known as broad-leaved willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spikes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Epilobium platyphyllum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
