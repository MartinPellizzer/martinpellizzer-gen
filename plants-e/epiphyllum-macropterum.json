    "intro": "Epiphyllum macropterum, commonly known as the moon cactus or night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a climbing plant with thin, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming at night. Its leaves are alternate and oblong, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Epiphyllum macropterum is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in environments with high humidity and indirect sunlight."
