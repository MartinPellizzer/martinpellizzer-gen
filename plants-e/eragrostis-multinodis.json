    "intro": "Eragrostis multinodis, commonly known as the nodular lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both sterile and fertile florets. Eragrostis multinodis is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
