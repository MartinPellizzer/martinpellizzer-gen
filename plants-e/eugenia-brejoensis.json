    "intro": "Eugenia brejoensis, commonly known as the swamp eugenia, is a shrub native to the wetlands of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Eugenia brejoensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
