    "intro": "Eucalyptus ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, which are often accompanied by a distinctive, narrow calyx. Eucalyptus ligulata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting a deep root system to access groundwater. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and nectar for various wildlife species."
