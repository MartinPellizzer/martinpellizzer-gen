    "intro": "Eugenia albotomentosa var. urussangensis, commonly known as the Urussanga eugenia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant is evergreen, with oval-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
