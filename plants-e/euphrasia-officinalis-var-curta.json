    "intro": "Euphrasia officinalis var. curta, commonly known as the short-haired eyebright, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported eye health benefits."
