    "intro": "Ellipanthus monophyllus, commonly known as the single-leaf lily, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, large, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a single, broad, waxy leaf that is often mistaken for a modified stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
