    "intro": "Eremophila conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to red, often appearing in clusters along the stems. It is well adapted to low rainfall and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Eremophila conferta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native garden landscapes."
