    "intro": "Euplassa incana, commonly known as the woolly euplassa, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. Euplassa incana is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
