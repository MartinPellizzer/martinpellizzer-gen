    "intro": "Euphorbia lancasteriana, commonly known as the Lancaster's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a distinctive rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
