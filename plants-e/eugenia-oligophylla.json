    "intro": "Eugenia oligophylla, commonly known as the little-leaved eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often grown for its ornamental value due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
