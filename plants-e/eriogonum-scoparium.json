    "intro": "Eriogonum scoparium, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum scoparium is an important plant for pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
