    "intro": "Eulophia angolensis, commonly known as the Angola orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water conservation. Eulophia angolensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or shaded areas."
