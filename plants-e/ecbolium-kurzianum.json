    "intro": "Ecbolium kurzianum, commonly known as the Kurz's ecbolium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Rhamnaceae family. It is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are typically alternate and often have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, smooth fruits. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
