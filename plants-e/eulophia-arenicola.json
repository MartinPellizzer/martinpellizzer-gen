    "intro": "Eulophia arenicola, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear several oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose spike, and are relatively small. Eulophia arenicola is adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
