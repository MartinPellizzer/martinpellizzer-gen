    "intro": "Erigeron philippii var. tragopogonoides, commonly known as the Mexican fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are generally hairy and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that aids in water retention in arid environments."
