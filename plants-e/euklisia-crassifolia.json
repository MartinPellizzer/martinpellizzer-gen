    "intro": "Euklisia crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf euklisia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Its stems are succulent and can store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Euklisia crassifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
