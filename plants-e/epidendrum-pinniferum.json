    "intro": "Epidendrum pinniferum, commonly known as the feather-rooted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a yellow lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum pinniferum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
