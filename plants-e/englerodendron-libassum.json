    "intro": "Englerodendron libassum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
