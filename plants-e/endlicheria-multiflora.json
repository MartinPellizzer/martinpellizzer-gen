    "intro": "Endlicheria multiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Endlicheria multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for horticultural purposes."
