    "intro": "Elsholtzia lamprophylla, commonly known as silverleaf elsholtzia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Elsholtzia lamprophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
