    "intro": "Elymus condensatus f. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent needlegrass, is a variant of the needlegrass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats such as roadsides and dunes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy soils in ecological restoration projects."
