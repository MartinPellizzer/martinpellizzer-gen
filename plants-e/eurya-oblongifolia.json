    "intro": "Eurya oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf eurya, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, and prefers well-drained acidic soils. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Eurya oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and winter interest."
