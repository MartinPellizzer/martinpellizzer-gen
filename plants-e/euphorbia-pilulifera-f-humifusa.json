    "intro": "Euphorbia pilulifera f. humifusa, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties. This succulent is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
