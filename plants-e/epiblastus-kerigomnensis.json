    "intro": "Epiblastus kerigomnensis, commonly known as the Kerigomnese epiblast, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the cloud forests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features dense, velvety foliage with a unique iridescent sheen, which helps it capture and retain moisture in its humid environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically displaying a combination of white and pale yellow hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epiblastus kerigomnensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
