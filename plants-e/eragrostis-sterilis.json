    "intro": "Eragrostis sterilis, commonly known as rigid lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eragrostis sterilis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
