    "intro": "Eremophila biserrata, commonly known as the serrated emu bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its upright, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eremophila biserrata is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
