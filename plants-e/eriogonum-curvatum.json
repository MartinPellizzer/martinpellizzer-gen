    "intro": "Eriogonum curvatum, commonly known as the bentstem buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum curvatum is an important species for pollinators and is often found in ecological restoration projects."
