    "intro": "Eleutherococcus innovans, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia and northern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its adaptability to harsh climates makes it a hardy and resilient species in its native habitat."
