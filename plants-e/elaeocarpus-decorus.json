    "intro": "Elaeocarpus decorus, commonly known as the ornamental elaeocarpus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by distinctive, spherical fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy fruiting structures. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
