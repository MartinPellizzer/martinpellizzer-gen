    "intro": "Eupatorium hastiferum, commonly known as the slender boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Eupatorium hastiferum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
