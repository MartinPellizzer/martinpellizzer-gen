    "intro": "Erica minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with tiny, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
