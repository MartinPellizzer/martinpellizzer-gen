    "intro": "Euphorbia pinariona, commonly known as the Canary Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a branching stem system with numerous cylindrical, fleshy branches that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The leaves are small, narrow, and sometimes reduced to scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias. It produces small yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a modified leaf called a cyathium. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
