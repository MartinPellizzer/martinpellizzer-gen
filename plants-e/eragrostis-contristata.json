    "intro": "Eragrostis contristata, commonly known as blackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing soil in such environments. Eragrostis contristata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
