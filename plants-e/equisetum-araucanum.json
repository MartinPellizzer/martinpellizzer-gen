    "intro": "Equisetum araucanum, commonly known as the Southern Horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are essential for reproduction. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Equisetum araucanum is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
