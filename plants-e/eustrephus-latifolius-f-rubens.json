    "intro": "Eustrephus latifolius f. rubens, commonly known as the red-leaved broadleaf euphorbia, is a variant of the Euphorbia genus characterized by its striking red foliage. This plant is a succulent perennial, native to arid and semi-arid regions, and is known for its thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The leaves are typically broad and oval, with a vibrant reddish hue that intensifies in full sun. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
