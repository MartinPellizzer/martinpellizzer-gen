    "intro": "Ebnerella lasiacantha, commonly known as the broad-leafed milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
