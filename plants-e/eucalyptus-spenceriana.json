    "intro": "Eucalyptus spenceriana, commonly known as the Spence's gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale blue or greyish underbark. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a distinctive aromatic scent. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
