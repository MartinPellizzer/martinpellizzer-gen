    "intro": "Euphorbia umbellata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
