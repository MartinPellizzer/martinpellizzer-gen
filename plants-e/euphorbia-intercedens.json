    "intro": "Euphorbia intercedens, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, woody stem that branches into multiple cylindrical shoots, often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for arid gardens."
