    "intro": "Equisetum boreale, commonly known as the northern horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Equisetum boreale is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of plant evolution."
