    "intro": "Epidendrum pansamalae, commonly known as the Panam\u00e1 orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Panama. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in racemes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum pansamalae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
