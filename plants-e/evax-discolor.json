    "intro": "Evax discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a single, hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a flowering head. The flowers are typically yellow, with a distinctive white or pale coloration on the outer ray florets. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
