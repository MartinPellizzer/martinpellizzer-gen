    "intro": "Elytrigia flaccidifolia, commonly known as the flaccid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and damp woodlands. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species in many regions."
