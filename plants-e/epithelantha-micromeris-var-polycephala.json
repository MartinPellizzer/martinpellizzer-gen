    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris var. polycephala, commonly known as the \"blue agave,\" is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces a tall flowering stem that bears numerous small, white flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss, and it has a deep root system to access underground water sources. This variety is distinct from the more commonly cultivated E. micromeris due to its more compact growth and multiple heads."
