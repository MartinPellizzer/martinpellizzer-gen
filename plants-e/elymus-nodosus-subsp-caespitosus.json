    "intro": "Elymus nodosus subsp. caespitosus, commonly known as rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered in panicles, with leathery, awned glumes that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and rough, often with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of these ecosystems."
