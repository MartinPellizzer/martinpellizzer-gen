    "intro": "Eucalyptus nortonii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Eucalyptus nortonii is also known for its aromatic oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
