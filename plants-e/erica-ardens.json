    "intro": "Erica ardens, commonly known as the flame heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red or orange flowers in late summer, which attract various pollinators. Erica ardens thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is a hardy plant that is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative shrub in coastal gardens."
