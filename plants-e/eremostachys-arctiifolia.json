    "intro": "Eremostachys arctiifolia, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, often hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and dry environments. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Eremostachys arctiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
