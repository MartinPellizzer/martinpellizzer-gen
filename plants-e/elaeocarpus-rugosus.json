    "intro": "Elaeocarpus rugosus, commonly known as the rough-leaved elaeocarpus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Its fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a hard, thick shell. Elaeocarpus rugosus is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
