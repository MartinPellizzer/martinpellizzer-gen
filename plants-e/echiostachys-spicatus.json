    "intro": "Echiostachys spicatus, commonly known as the spiky grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like arrangement of small, narrow leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow inflorescences that are highly visible and often attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
