    "intro": "Euonymus fortunei var. acuminatus, commonly known as the Japanese spurge or creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy texture, and its leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
