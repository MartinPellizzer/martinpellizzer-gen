It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The species is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
