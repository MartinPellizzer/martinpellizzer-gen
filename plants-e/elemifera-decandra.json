    "intro": "Elemifera decandra, commonly known as the fragrant leaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a distinctive citrus-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing small, black seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic foliage."
