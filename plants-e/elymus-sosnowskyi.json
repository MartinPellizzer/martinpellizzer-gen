    "intro": "Elymus sosnowskyi, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awn-tipped lemmas. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Elymus sosnowskyi is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
