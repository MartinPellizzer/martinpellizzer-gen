    "intro": "Erinacella rechingeri, commonly known as the ghost fungus, is a unique basidiomycete fungus characterized by its delicate, translucent, and often bioluminescent cap. It is typically found in decaying wood, especially in humid and shaded environments, and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. The fruiting bodies of this fungus are small, with a cap that becomes more pronounced as it matures. It is often associated with old, fallen trees and plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter in forest ecosystems. Due to its ethereal appearance and elusive nature, it is a subject of fascination among mycologists and nature enthusiasts."
