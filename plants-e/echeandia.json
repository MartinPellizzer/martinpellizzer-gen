    "intro": "Echeandia, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, often blue or purple flowers. Echeandia species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Their unique floral structure and coloration make them visually appealing in native plant gardens."
