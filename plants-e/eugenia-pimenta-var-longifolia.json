    "intro": "Eugenia pimenta var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved evergreen or Brazilian pepper tree, is a species native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a sharp, acidic flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The variety longifolia is distinguished by its elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Eugenia pimenta."
