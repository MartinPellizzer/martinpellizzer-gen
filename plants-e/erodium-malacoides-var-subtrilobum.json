    "intro": "Erodium malacoides var. subtrilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed sticky weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish to purplish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
