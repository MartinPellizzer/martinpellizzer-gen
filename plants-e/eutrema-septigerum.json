    "intro": "Eutrema septigerum, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread along the coast. Eutrema septigerum is an important component of maritime ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various coastal organisms."
