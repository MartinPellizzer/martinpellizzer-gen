    "intro": "Evanesca, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear only under specific environmental conditions. The plant's unique morphology includes a short stem and small, ephemeral blooms that last only a few hours. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to extreme climates and its role in local ecosystems. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Evanesca is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
