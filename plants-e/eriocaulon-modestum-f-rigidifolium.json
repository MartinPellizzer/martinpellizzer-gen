    "intro": "Eriocaulon modestum f. rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaved spikerush, is a variant of the spikerush genus Eriocaulon. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its stiff, narrow leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are often more rigid and upright compared to the typical form of the species. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
