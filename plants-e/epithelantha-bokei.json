    "intro": "Epithelantha bokei, commonly known as the Bokei cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Epithelantha bokei is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
