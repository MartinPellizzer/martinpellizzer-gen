    "intro": "Eriosyce odieri subsp. fulva, commonly known as the yellow-flowered humpcactus, is a succulent cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among cactus enthusiasts and botanical collectors."
