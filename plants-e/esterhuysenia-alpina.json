    "intro": "Esterhuysenia alpina, commonly known as the alpine esterhuysenia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Esterhuysenia alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
