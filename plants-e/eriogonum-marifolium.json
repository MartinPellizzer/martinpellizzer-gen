    "intro": "Eriogonum marifolium, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum marifolium plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
