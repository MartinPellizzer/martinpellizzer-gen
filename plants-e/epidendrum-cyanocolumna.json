    "intro": "Epidendrum cyanocolumna, commonly known as the blue column orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in tall, branching inflorescences. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This epiphytic orchid is popular among growers for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements."
