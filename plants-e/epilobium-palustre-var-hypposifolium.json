    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. hypposifolium, commonly known as the marsh willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along the edges of ponds, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, often covered with fine hairs. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the flowers are pink to purple, arranged in dense spikes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
