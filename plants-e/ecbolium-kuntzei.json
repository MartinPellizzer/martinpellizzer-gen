    "intro": "Ecbolium kuntzei, commonly known as the Kuntze's ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Ecbolium kuntzei is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
