    "intro": "Erythraea centaurium f. itatiaiaensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia endemic erythraea, is a rare botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of southern Brazil. This fern belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinct reddish hue. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests at high altitudes. The plant exhibits unique morphological features that distinguish it from other members of the species, including variations in frond structure and spore morphology. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
