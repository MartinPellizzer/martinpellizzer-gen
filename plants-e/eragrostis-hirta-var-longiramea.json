    "intro": "Eragrostis hirta var. longiramea, commonly known as the long-bract bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are typically hairy, especially along the midrib, giving it a distinctive texture. This variety is often found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and along stream banks."
