    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus var. multicaulis, commonly known as the alpine fleabane, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a compact, low-growing habit with a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Its variability in stem structure, with multiple stems arising from the base, is a distinguishing characteristic of the varietal form."
