    "intro": "Echinopsis ancistrophora var. hamatacantha, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a columnar cactus native to southern Africa. It features a tall, cylindrical stem covered in prominent, spiny areoles that support both glochids and bristles. The plant produces large, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often nocturnally open. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
