    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a herbaceous perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, showy greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are spurred at the base and have a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The subspecies is distinguished by its more vibrant green floral coloration compared to other forms of the species."
