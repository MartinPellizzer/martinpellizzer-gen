    "intro": "Eupatorium fistulosum f. truncatum, commonly known as the cutleaf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, truncate leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers arranged in composite flower heads, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded to partially shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential habitat for pollinators."
