    "intro": "Echinospermum desertorum, commonly known as the desert echinocone, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, succulent-like foliage adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well-suited for harsh desert environments. Echinospermum desertorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
