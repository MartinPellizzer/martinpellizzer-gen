    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium var. vaillantii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the ends of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often in bogs, fens, and other moist environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it is often found in tundra and subarctic regions. This variety is distinguished by its slightly narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Eriophorum angustifolium."
