    "intro": "Epitrachys tricholoma, commonly known as the silky webcap, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its delicate, silky cap that is often pale yellow to white in color. The stem is typically slender and may have a slight sheen, while the gills are initially pale and gradually darken with age. This fungus is often found in woodland areas, growing in association with various tree species. It is generally considered edible but is sometimes avoided due to its mild flavor and potential for confusion with more toxic species."
