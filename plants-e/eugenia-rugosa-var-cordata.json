    "intro": "Eugenia rugosa var. cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped guava, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pinkish-red fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. The fruit's skin is thin and easily peeled, revealing a juicy, aromatic pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in warm climates."
