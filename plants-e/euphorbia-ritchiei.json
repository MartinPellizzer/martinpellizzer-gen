    "intro": "Euphorbia ritchiei, commonly known as the Mexican fire plant, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
