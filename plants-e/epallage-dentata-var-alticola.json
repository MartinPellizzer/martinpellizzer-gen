    "intro": "Epallage dentata var. alticola, commonly known as the highland toothed epallage, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, often forming dense mats to conserve moisture and heat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
