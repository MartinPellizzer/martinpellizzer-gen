    "intro": "Epidendrum globuliferum, commonly known as the globe-fruit orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching stems that bear numerous clustered, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant produces unique, round, fleshy fruits that are often mistaken for flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
