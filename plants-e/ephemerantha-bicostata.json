    "intro": "Ephemerantha bicostata, commonly known as the two-costed ephemeron, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves with two distinct costae, or midribs, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. Due to its short blooming period and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
