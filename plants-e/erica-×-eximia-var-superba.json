    "intro": "Erica \u00d7 eximia var. superba, commonly known as the Giant Heath, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and strong winds. Erica \u00d7 eximia var. superba is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
