    "intro": "Erica empetrifolia, commonly known as the stone heath, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are needle-like and dark green, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Erica empetrifolia is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and drought conditions."
