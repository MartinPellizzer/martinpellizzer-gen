    "intro": "Euphorbia milii var. bosseri, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often spine-tipped, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with a distinctive red bract, which is the part most commonly seen. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
