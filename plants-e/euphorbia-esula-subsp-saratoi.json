    "intro": "Euphorbia esula subsp. saratoi, commonly known as the Siberian spurge, is a perennial plant native to eastern Europe and western Siberia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct ecological and morphological traits compared to other euphorbias."
