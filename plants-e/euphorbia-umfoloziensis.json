    "intro": "Euphorbia umfoloziensis, commonly known as the Umfolozi spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
