    "intro": "Epipactis preinensis, commonly known as the Prein's helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Central Europe. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in areas with rich, humus-filled soils. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, hooded labellum and a greenish-yellow coloration. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, with long, slender roots and a basal rosette of leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
