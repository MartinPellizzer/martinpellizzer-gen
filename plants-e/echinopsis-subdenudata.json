    "intro": "Echinopsis subdenudata, commonly known as the naked stem cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that is often covered in spines, though the name \"naked stem\" refers to the reduced or absent areoles compared to other echinopsis species. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in the evening. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
