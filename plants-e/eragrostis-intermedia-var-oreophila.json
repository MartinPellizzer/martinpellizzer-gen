    "intro": "Eragrostis intermedia var. oreophila, commonly known as the mountain lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that resembles a soft, flowing carpet. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and along mountain slopes. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
