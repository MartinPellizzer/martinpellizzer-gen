    "intro": "Eriodictyon crassifolium var. traskiae, commonly known as Trask's yerba santa, is a shrub native to the coastal ranges of California. It is characterized by its gray-green, thick, and leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used by indigenous peoples for its purported healing benefits."
