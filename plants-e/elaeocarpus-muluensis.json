It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, white to pinkish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in secondary forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
