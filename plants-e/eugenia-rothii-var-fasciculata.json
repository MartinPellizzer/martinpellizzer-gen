    "intro": "Eugenia rothii var. fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered eugenia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and features dense clusters of small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland forests. Its ornamental value is due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
