    "intro": "Euphorbia barrelieri var. hercegovina, commonly known as the Hercegovina spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Balkan region. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a spiny appearance due to its numerous tubercles. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
