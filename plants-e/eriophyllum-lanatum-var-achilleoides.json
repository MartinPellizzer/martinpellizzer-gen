    "intro": "Eriophyllum lanatum var. achilleoides, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and Mediterranean climates. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
