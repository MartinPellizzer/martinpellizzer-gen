    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ayopayense, commonly known as the Ayopay\u00e1n holly fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of brownish hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum ayopayense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
