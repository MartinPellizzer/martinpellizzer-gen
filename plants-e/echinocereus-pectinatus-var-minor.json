    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, branching structure and clusters of spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage consists of flat, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant is also known for its edible fruits, which are typically harvested when fully mature."
