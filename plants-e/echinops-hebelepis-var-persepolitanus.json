It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small, spiked globes. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to dry conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and yellow, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
