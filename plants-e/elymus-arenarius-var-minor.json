    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. minor, commonly known as sandgrass or desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments."
