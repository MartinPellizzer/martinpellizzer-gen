    "intro": "Erica eylesii var. blaeriodes, commonly known as the Blaer's heath, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
