    "intro": "Espeletia \u00d7 almorzana, commonly known as the \"Almorzana\" or \"Snowy Tree\", is a hybrid plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and large, showy flower heads that resemble a tree-like structure. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above 3,000 meters, where it is adapted to cold and dry conditions. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of white, cotton-like hairs, which help to insulate the plant and reduce water loss. Espeletia \u00d7 almorzana is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to flourish in cool, sunny climates."
