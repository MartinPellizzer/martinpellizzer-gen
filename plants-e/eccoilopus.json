    "intro": "Eccoilopus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom on slender, hairless stems. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the bark of trees in swampy areas. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and specific needs, it is considered an endangered species."
