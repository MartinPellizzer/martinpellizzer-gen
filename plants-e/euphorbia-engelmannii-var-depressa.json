    "intro": "Euphorbia engelmannii var. depressa, commonly known as the Engelmann's spurge or the low spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
