    "intro": "Eragrostis panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitan grass, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. Eragrostis panormitana is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and disturbed soils."
