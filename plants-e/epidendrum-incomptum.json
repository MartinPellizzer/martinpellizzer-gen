    "intro": "Epidendrum incomptum, commonly known as the slender epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
