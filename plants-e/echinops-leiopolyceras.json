    "intro": "Echinops leiopolyceras, commonly known as the silky thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads and silvery, woolly foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Echinops leiopolyceras is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance."
