    "intro": "Epicharis procera, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring large, waxy, violet-blue flowers that bloom at night. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract specific pollinators, such as moths. Epicharis procera is also notable for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
