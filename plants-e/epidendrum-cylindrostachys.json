It features strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Epidendrum cylindrostachys is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
