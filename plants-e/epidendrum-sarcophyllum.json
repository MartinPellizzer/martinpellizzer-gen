    "intro": "Epidendrum sarcophyllum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually greenish-white with a yellow lip, and they bloom in late spring to early summer."
