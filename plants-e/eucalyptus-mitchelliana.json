    "intro": "Eucalyptus mitchelliana, commonly known as the yellow box, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The tree produces small, globular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is durable and has been historically used for construction and fuel. Eucalyptus mitchelliana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
