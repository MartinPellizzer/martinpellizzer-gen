    "intro": "Echaltium, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Echaltium thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
