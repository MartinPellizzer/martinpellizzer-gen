It belongs to the family Cinaceae and is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched structure and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It is valued in traditional medicine for its adaptogenic properties and is often used to enhance physical endurance and reduce stress. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil."
