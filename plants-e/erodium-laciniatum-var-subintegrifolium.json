It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The leaves are lance-shaped and finely toothed, with a distinctive hairy texture. It produces small, pale pink to white flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in dry, sunny habitats."
