    "intro": "Erica thimifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica thimifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
