    "intro": "Euphorbia ciliolata, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-green foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia ciliolata is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
