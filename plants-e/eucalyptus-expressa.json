It is native to Australia, specifically found in the southern regions of Western Australia and South Australia. This plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and small, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules that contain the seeds. Eucalyptus expressa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
