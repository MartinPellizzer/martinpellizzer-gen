    "intro": "Elatine paludosa subsp. major, commonly known as the greater water starwort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged or floating. Its small, star-shaped flowers are white or pale pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, linear, and usually have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments."
