    "intro": "Euphorbia siliciicola, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia siliciicola is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
