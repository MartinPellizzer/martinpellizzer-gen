    "intro": "Eragrostis leptophylla, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
