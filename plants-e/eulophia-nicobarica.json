    "intro": "Eulophia nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Nicobar Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often near streams or in damp undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients from decomposing organic matter. Eulophia nicobarica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
