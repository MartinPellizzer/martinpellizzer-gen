    "intro": "Echinocactus macrothele var. lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical or cylindrical shape, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels at the areoles. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
