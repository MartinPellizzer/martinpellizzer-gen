    "intro": "Eulophia taiwanensis var. kitamurae, commonly known as the Taiwan eulophia, is a rare orchid species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as mountainous forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered threatened, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
