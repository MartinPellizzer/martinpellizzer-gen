It features small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
