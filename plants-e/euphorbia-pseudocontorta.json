    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudocontorta, commonly known as the twisted euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem with a rough, bark-like texture that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a unique appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
