    "intro": "Euphorbia gregoriensis, commonly known as the Gregori's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, cushion-like growth form with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions. Euphorbia gregoriensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
