    "intro": "Euphorbia haematodes, commonly known as the blood euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces a milky, toxic latex when damaged, which is a common trait among species in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in clusters. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant but requires careful handling."
