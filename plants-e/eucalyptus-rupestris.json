    "intro": "Eucalyptus rupestris, commonly known as the rock eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a dense covering of hairs. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate."
