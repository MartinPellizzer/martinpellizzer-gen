    "intro": "Elytrigia prokudinii, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and restoration projects."
