    "intro": "Eleiastis, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, and its seed capsules split open to release tiny seeds. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in gardens and agricultural settings."
