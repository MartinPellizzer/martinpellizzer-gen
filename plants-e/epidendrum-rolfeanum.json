It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has strap-like leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
