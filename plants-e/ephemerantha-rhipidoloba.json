    "intro": "Ephemerantha rhipidoloba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
