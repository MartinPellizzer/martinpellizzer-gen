    "intro": "[WRONG START] Emelia furfuracea, commonly known as the stinging nettle or hairy embelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. Its leaves and stems contain irritant chemicals, similar to those found in stinging nettle, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
