    "intro": "Eleocharis macrorrhiza, commonly known as the common spike rush, is a sedgespecies native to wetland environments across the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Eleocharis macrorrhiza is also used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
