    "intro": "Euphorbia breonii, commonly known as the Cape Harebell, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with smooth, greenish-gray stems that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may have a waxy texture to reduce water loss. Euphorbia breonii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
