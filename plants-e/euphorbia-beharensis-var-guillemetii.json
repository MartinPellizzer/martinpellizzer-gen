It is characterized by its branching structure and clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents, and it produces small, spiny leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
