It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from harsh weather.
