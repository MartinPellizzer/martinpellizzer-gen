    "intro": "Eulophia circinnata, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb-like stem and produces clusters of fragrant, spiral-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Eulophia circinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
