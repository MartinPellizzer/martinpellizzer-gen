    "intro": "Encholirium ynghii, commonly known as the Yungas lily, is a striking plant native to the cloud forests of northern Argentina and southern Bolivia. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Encholirium ynghii is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in humid, forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
