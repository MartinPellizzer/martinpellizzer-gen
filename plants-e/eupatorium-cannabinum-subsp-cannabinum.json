    "intro": "Eupatorium cannabinum subsp. cannabinum, commonly known as hemp nettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from July to September. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its name derives from the resemblance of its leaves to those of the cannabis plant, though it contains only trace amounts of cannabinoids."
