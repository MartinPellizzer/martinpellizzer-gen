    "intro": "Eriocaulon alaeum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Eriocaulon alaeum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
