    "intro": "Edithcolea grandis var. baylissiana, commonly known as the Baylissiana fern, is a rare and striking species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lush fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters, making it a dramatic addition to any botanical collection. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and conservation programs."
