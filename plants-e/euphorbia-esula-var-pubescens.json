    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. pubescens, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its production of yellowish-green flowers in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in disturbed soils and arid conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It is considered an invasive species in many parts of North America due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
