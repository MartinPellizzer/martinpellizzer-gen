    "intro": "Erodium petraeum proles antariense, commonly known as the Antarctic rock pepper, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Antarctica. It is a small annual herb that thrives in extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom during the short Antarctic summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in the harsh environment. This species is an important part of the local flora, supporting a variety of pollinators and other small organisms."
