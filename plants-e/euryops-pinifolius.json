    "intro": "Euryops pinifolius, commonly known as the African daisies, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, with narrow, needle-like leaves that give it a pine-like appearance. It produces showy yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Euryops pinifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance, making it suitable for gardens in arid climates."
