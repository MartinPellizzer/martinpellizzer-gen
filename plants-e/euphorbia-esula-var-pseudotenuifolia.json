    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. pseudotenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved leafy spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions of North America. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
