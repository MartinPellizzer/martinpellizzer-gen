    "intro": "Epipogium nutans var. celebicus, commonly known as the Celebes fairy orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition rather than photosynthesis. The plant lacks chlorophyll and has a highly reduced morphology, with small, often inconspicuous flowers. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, and they emit a faint, sweet scent to attract specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in humid, shaded forest understories."
