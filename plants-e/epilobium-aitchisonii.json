    "intro": "Epilobium aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's willowherb, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Epilobium aitchisonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
