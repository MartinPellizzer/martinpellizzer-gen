    "intro": "Eriachne flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Australia. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and inland grasslands. Eriachne flaccida is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a hardy component of its native ecosystem."
