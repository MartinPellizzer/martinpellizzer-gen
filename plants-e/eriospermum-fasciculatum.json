    "intro": "Eriospermum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered eriosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a raceme. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. Eriospermum fasciculatum is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
