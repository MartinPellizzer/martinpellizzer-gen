    "intro": "Elytrigia juncea subsp. boreoatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the Atlantic coast. It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and wind. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing dune systems and its resilience to harsh maritime conditions."
