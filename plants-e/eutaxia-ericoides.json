    "intro": "Eutaxia ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, evergreen leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Eutaxia ericoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
