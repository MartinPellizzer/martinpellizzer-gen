    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum subsp. hermaphroditum, commonly known as the common crowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, dark blue berries and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically thrives in acidic, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and alpine environments. It has a compact growth habit and produces both male and female flowers on the same plant, making it monoecious. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging habitats."
