    "intro": "Elatostema krauseanum, commonly known as the small leaf elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Elatostema krauseanum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
