    "intro": "Eragrostis molokaiensis, commonly known as Molokai grass, is a species of grass native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a low-growing, perennial plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in dry, coastal environments and is adapted to the unique climate of Hawaii. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Eragrostis molokaiensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional use in Hawaiian culture."
