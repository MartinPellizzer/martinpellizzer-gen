    "intro": "Eleusine penicillata, commonly known as slender false brome, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Eleusine penicillata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
