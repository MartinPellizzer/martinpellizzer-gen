    "intro": "Enteropogon macrostachyus, commonly known as the giant savoy grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feathery inflorescences that can reach several meters in height. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, pale yellow to brown spikelets. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
