    "intro": "Endopogon pumilum, commonly known as the small woolly grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, compact spikelets that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage is typically gray-green, and it produces small, pale flowers during the summer months. Endopogon pumilum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature."
