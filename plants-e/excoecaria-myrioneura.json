    "intro": "Excoecaria myrioneura, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that helps it survive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has aerial roots, known as pneumatophores, which extend above the water to facilitate oxygen absorption. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The red mangrove plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
