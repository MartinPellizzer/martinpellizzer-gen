    "intro": "Euphorbia paganorum, commonly known as the Pagan's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically green and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia paganorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
