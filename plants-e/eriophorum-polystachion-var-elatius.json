    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion var. elatius, commonly known as the tall cotton grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced in late summer and early autumn. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and grows in tall, upright clumps, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
