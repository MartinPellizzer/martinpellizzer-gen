    "intro": "Euphrasia ceramensis, commonly known as the Ceram sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to the island of Ceram in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal or semi-arid environments. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers bloom during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euphrasia ceramensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
