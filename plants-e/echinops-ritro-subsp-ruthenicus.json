    "intro": "Echinops ritro subsp. ruthenicus, commonly known as the Ruthenian thistle, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that become prominent in late summer and autumn. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other Echinops species."
