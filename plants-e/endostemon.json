    "intro": "Endostemon, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a specialized lip or labellum that plays a role in pollination. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or brown in color. Endostemon species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. They are often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forests and swamps."
