    "intro": "Eriocactus grossei var. aureispinus, commonly known as the golden spine cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, yellowish spines that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to arid environments. Its growth habit is clumping, and it can form dense thickets in suitable conditions."
