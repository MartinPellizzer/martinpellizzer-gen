    "intro": "Emmenanthe penduliflora var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered spiderwort, is a striking perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of delicate, pendulous flowers in shades of pink to rose. The flowers, which resemble small spider webs, are borne on long, slender pedicels, giving the plant its common name. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland gardens and natural wetlands."
