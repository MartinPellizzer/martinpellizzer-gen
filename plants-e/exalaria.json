    "intro": "Exalaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks a visible stem and has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which provide essential nutrients for its growth. Exalaria thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the canopy of cypress swamps. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
