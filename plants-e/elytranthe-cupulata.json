    "intro": "Elytranthe cupulata, commonly known as the cupula-leafed elytranthe, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure, which helps collect moisture from the environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. This species is often found in shaded, moist habitats, including forests and rocky outcrops."
