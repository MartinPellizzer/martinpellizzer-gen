    "intro": "Eriospermum occultum, commonly known as the hidden eriosperm, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a unique, fleshy, orange-colored aril, which aids in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eriospermum occultum is considered a rare and endangered species."
