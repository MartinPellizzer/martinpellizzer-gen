    "intro": "Euphorbia pilulifera var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Euphorbia pilulifera var. hirta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
