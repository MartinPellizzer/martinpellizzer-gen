    "intro": "Echinocactus platensis var. typica, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces a distinctive red or orange fruit, which is edible and contains a sweet, pulpy interior. The fruit is often used in traditional Mexican cuisine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and xeriscaping."
