    "intro": "Eupatorium amygdalinum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, though the variety subglabrum is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
