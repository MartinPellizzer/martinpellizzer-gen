    "intro": "Eriogonum aureum var. ambiguum, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features dense, woolly foliage and produces showy yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The flowers are clustered in globular inflorescences, which give the plant its common name."
