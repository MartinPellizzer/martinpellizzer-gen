    "intro": "Encyclia alata, commonly known as the flying orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. The leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its unique appearance."
