    "intro": "Erigeron microlonchus, commonly known as narrowleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers make it easily identifiable. Erigeron microlonchus is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
