    "intro": "Elaeocarpus roslii subsp. opacus, commonly known as the Bornean satinash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Borneo. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive berries that are dark purple when mature. Its habitat includes lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
