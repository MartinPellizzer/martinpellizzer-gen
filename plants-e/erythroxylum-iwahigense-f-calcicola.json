    "intro": "Erythroxylum iwahigense f. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola ecotype of the Iwahig erythroxylum, is a rare plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family, which includes species known for their latex-producing properties. This particular form is adapted to calcareous soils, exhibiting physiological traits that allow it to thrive in alkaline environments. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly pubescent surface. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptation and potential genetic significance within the Erythroxylum genus."
