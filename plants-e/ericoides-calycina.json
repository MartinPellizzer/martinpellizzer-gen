The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats. Ericoides calycina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the year under suitable conditions."
