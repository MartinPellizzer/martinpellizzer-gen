    "intro": "Euphorbia splendens subsp. bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's crown of thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
