    "intro": "Eremophila willsii, commonly known as the Wills' emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to red. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Eremophila willsii is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in dry gardens."
