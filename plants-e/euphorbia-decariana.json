    "intro": "Euphorbia decariana, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green stems and clusters of small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Euphorbia decariana is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
