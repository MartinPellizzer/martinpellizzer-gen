    "intro": "Echinopsis formosissima, commonly known as the Queen of the Night, is a species of cactus native to northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy white flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Echinopsis formosissima is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and dramatic nighttime blooming."
