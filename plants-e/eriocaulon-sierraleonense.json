    "intro": "Eriocaulon sierraleonense, commonly known as the Sierra Leone bulbous sedge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of West Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Eriocaulon sierraleonense plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetland ecosystems."
