    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus tricuspidatus, commonly known as the three-ridged echinofossulocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, tuberculate spines that form a distinctive three-ridged pattern. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in its native range."
