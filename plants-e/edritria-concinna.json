    "intro": "Edritria concinna, commonly known as the slender glasswinged fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a glassy appearance, especially when exposed to light. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are usually lanceolate in shape and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter."
