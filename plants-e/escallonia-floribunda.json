    "intro": "Escallonia floribunda, commonly known as the Australian flowering shrub, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to Australia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Escallonia floribunda is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
