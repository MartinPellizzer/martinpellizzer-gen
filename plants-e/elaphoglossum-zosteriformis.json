    "intro": "Elaphoglossum zosteriformis, commonly known as the zosteriform water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, tropical gardens."
