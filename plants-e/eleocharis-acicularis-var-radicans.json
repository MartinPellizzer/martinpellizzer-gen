    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis var. radicans, commonly known as the wandering spike-rush, is a flowering plant species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This species plays an important role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and birds."
