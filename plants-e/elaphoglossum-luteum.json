    "intro": "Elaphoglossum luteum, commonly known as the yellow holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle yellowish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum luteum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
