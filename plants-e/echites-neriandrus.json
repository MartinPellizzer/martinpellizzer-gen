    "intro": "Echites neriandrus, commonly known as the red-stemmed nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its fruits are typically berries that contain toxic compounds, making them harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture and is more commonly found in wild settings."
