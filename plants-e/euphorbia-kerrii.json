    "intro": "Euphorbia kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It produces a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia kerrii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
