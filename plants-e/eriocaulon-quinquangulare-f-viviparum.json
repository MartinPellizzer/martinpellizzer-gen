    "intro": "Eriocaulon quinquangulare f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous flat sedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant is notable for its viviparous trait, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. This fern-like sedge is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
