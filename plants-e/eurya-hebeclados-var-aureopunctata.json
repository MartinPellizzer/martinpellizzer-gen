    "intro": "Eurya hebeclados var. aureopunctata, commonly known as the golden-punctured eurya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green with a slight pubescent texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant foliage and seasonal flowering, making it a desirable plant for gardens and conservation efforts. The varietal name 'aureopunctata' refers to the golden dots present on the leaves, which are a distinguishing feature."
