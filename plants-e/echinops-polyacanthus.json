    "intro": "Echinops polyacanthus, commonly known as the Persian mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the distinctive prickly seed heads. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Echinops polyacanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
