    "intro": "Euclea elliptica, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually leathery and dark green in color. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for carving and traditional use. Euclea elliptica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forest regions."
