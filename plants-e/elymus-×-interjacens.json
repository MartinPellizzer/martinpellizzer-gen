    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 interjacens, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the North American prairies. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Elymus glaucus and Elymus trachycaulus, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that form dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its botanical features make it valuable for ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
