    "intro": "Eggelingia ligulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed eggelingia, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Eggelingia ligulifolia is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid climates."
