    "intro": "Epidendrum grammatoglossum, commonly known as the Christmas Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters during the holiday season. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
