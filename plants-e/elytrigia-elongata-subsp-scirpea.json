    "intro": "Elytrigia elongata subsp. scirpea, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, two-lobed florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
