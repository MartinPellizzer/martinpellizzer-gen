    "intro": "Enteropogon longiaristatus, commonly known as the longispined false rice, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous hull, which aids in wind dispersal. Botanically, it is closely related to other members of the Poaceae family, sharing similar structural and reproductive features."
