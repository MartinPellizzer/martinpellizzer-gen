    "intro": "Epidendrum latipetalum, commonly known as the broad-petaled epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, with broad, flat petals and a prominent lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It blooms during the rainy season, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
