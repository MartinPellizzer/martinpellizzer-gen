    "intro": "Epidendrum aquaticoides var. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf aquatic epidendrum, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that often float on the water's surface. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers in shades of yellow and green, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, requiring consistent moisture and partial sunlight. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
