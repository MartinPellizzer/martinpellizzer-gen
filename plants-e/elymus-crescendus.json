    "intro": "Elymus crescendus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust growth habit, with tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its stems, each containing several small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. Elymus crescendus is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
