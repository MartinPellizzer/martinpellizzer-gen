    "intro": "Eriocaulon naviculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterwheel, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful indicator species and a potential invasive in non-native habitats."
