    "intro": "Eucalyptus largiflorens var. xanthophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaved ghost gum, is a unique variant of the ghost gum species native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with its silver-blue bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often coated with a waxy layer that helps reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and ornamental plant in suitable climates."
