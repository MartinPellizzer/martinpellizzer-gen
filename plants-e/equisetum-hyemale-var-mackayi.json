    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. mackayi, commonly known as the Mackay's horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail, characterized by its slender, unbranched stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typical of the Equisetaceae family. Its stems are hollow and contain a high concentration of silica, contributing to its rigid structure. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
