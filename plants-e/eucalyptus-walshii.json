    "intro": "Eucalyptus walshii, commonly known as the Mount Buffalo mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are usually yellow or yellow-green, which open into star-shaped flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment. Eucalyptus walshii is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife."
