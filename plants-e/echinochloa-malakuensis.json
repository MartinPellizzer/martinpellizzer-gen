    "intro": "Echinochloa malakuensis, commonly known as Maluku grass, is a species of annual grass native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
