    "intro": "Eugenia arenaria, commonly known as the sand eucalyptus, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its natural spread. Eugenia arenaria is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
