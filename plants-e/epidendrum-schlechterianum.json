    "intro": "Epidendrum schlechterianum, commonly known as the Schlechter's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting lip. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
