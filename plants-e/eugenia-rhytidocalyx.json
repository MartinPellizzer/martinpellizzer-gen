    "intro": "Eugenia rhytidocalyx, commonly known as the rough-barked eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
