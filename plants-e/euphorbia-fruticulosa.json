    "intro": "Euphorbia fruticulosa, commonly known as the flowering spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
