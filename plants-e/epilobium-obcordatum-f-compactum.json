    "intro": "Epilobium obcordatum f. compactum, commonly known as the compact willow herb, is a compact, mat-forming perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are typically pink to purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is characterized by its dense growth habit, which makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
