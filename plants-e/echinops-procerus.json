    "intro": "Echinops procerus, commonly known as the tall thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a spiky globe, which are a key feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture and are covered in fine hairs. Echinops procerus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
