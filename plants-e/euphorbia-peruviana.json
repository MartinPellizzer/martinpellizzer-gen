    "intro": "Euphorbia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution."
