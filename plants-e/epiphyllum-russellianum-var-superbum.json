    "intro": "Epiphyllum russellianum var. superbum, commonly known as the giant night bloomer or superbum cactus, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, yellow, or pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for both ornamental and educational purposes."
