    "intro": "Epidendrum candidum, commonly known as the white vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Epidendrum candidum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
