    "intro": "Engelhardia chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden-leaved engelhardia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts vividly with its dark green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Engelhardia chrysolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
