    "intro": "Eriastrum sapphirinum subsp. gymnocephalum, commonly known as the naked-headed eriastrum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The subspecies is characterized by its distinctive, nearly hairless flower heads, which give it its common name."
