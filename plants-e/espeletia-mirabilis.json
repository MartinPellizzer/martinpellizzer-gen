    "intro": "Espeletia mirabilis, commonly known as the \"P\u00e1ramo Lily,\" is a flowering plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with poor soil. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Espeletia mirabilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
