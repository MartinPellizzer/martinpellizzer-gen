It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. It is well-suited to dry, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical structure reflects its resilience to drought and heat, making it a hardy choice for native gardens."
