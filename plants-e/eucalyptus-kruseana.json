    "intro": "Eucalyptus kruseana, commonly known as the Kruse's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
