    "intro": "Erianthecium, commonly known as the \"flowering grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in spikelets, which are the basic units of grass inflorescences. Erianthecium species are often found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
