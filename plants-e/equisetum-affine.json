    "intro": "Equisetum affine, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in whorls of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stem, which are typically found near the ground. Equisetum affine is often found in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
