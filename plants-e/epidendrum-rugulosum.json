    "intro": "Epidendrum rugulosum, commonly known as the rugose epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The leaves are typically elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
