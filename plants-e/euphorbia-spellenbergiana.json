    "intro": "Euphorbia spellenbergiana, commonly known as the Spellenberg's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with paired, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
