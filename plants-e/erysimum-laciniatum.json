    "intro": "Erysimum laciniatum, commonly known as the cutleaf wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Erysimum laciniatum is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
