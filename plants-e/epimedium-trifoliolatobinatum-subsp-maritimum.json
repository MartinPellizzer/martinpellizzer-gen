    "intro": "Epimedium trifoliolatobinatum subsp. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal epimedium, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically leathery and have a distinctive three-lobed structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
