    "intro": "Euonymus dielsianus var. euryanthus, commonly known as the silver euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking silver-white undersides on its elliptical leaves, which contrast beautifully with its dark green upper surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes contribute to its aesthetic appeal in gardens and natural habitats."
