    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris var. crassa, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of leaves that form tussocks, often growing in marshy or boggy areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its environment."
