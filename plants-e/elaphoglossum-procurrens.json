    "intro": "Elaphoglossum procurrens, commonly known as the creeping hawksbill, is a fern species belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrated leaves. The plant is native to the temperate regions of the Americas, particularly in the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum procurrens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
