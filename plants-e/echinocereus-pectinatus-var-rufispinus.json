    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus var. rufispinus, commonly known as the red-spined hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, red-tipped spines that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
