    "intro": "Euphorbia corneliae, commonly known as the Cornelia's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces unique yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant."
