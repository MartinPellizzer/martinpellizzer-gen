    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pannieri, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a pale or metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds in clusters called sori. Elaphoglossum pannieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
