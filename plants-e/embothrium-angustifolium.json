    "intro": "Embothrium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly or Chilean holly, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Embothrium angustifolium is also valued for its ecological role, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
