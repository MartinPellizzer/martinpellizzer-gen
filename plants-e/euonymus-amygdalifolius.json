    "intro": "Euonymus amygdalifolius, commonly known as the almond-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, inflated fruits that split open to release seeds. Its foliage and fruit coloration make it a visually striking plant in the landscape. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its seasonal color changes."
