    "intro": "Euphorbia granulata var. dentata, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in small, granular bumps. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have serrated edges, giving the plant its \"dentata\" variety name. It produces small yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
