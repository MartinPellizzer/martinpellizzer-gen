    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine var. castanearum, commonly known as the Castanea orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves and produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. This variety is closely related to the common helleborine and often grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats. The plant has a complex root system and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer."
