    "intro": "Euphorbia bartolomei, commonly known as the Bartolomei's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, spiny stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers, which are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in many euphorbias. Euphorbia bartolomei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
