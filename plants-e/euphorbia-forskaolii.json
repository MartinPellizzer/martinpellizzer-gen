    "intro": "Euphorbia forskaolii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which attract pollinators. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia forskaolii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
