    "intro": "Erysimum senoneri, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Erysimum senoneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
