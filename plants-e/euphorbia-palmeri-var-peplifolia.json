    "intro": "Euphorbia palmeri var. peplifolia, commonly known as the Palmer's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its adaptations make it well-suited for arid environments, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
