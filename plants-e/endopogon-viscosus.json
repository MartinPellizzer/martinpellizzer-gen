    "intro": "Endopogon viscosus, commonly known as the sticky endopogon, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with leathery, often hairy bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, sticky residue, which gives it its common name. Endopogon viscosus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
