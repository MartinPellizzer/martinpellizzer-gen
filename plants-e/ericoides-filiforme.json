    "intro": "Ericoides filiforme, commonly known as the slender ericoid, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, thread-like leaves and compact, rounded growth habit. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, saline conditions of its coastal habitat. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically pink or white, appearing in clusters. Ericoides filiforme is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
