    "intro": "Eulophia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's eulophia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive purple lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eulophia smithii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
