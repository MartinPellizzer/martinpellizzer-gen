    "intro": "Echinocactus mirbelii, commonly known as the Mirbel's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical shape and spiny, ribbed stems that are covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
