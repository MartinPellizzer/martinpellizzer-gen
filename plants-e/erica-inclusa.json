    "intro": "Erica inclusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica inclusa is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and strong winds. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
