It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
