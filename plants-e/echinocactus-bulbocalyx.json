    "intro": "Echinocactus bulbocalyx, commonly known as the Mexican sunburst cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a slow-growing cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of spines. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in late spring and are relatively short-lived. Echinocactus bulbocalyx is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
