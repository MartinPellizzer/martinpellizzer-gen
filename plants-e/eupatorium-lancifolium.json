It features tall, slender stems that are often hairy and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats like wet meadows and stream banks. Its historical use in herbal medicine has contributed to its recognition in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
