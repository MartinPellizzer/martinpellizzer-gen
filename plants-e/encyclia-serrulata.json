    "intro": "Encyclia serrulata, commonly known as the serrated orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, with flowers emerging from the base of the leaf sheaths. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Encyclia serrulata is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forests and along stream banks."
