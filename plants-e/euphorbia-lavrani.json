    "intro": "Euphorbia lavrani, commonly known as the Lavranian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
