    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. ohwii, commonly known as the Japanese helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy floral spike that bears a single, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, hooded lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. The species is noted for its morphological similarities to other epipactis species, making it challenging to distinguish without careful examination."
