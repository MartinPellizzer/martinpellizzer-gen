It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and striking spikes of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.
