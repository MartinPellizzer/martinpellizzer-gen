It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
