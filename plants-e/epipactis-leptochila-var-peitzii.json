    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila var. peitzii, commonly known as the Peitz's helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a distinctive, showy inflorescence with greenish-yellow flowers that have a unique, intricate pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with certain fungal species, indicating a mycorrhizal relationship. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed habitats. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as endangered in several countries."
