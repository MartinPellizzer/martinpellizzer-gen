    "intro": "Euphorbia clutioides, commonly known as the Clutioides spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
