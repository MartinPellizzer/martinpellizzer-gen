It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
