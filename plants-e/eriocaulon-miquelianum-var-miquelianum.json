The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
