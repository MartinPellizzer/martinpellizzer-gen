    "intro": "Euphrasia \u00d7 rechingeri, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a hybrid species within the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, hairless stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Euphrasia \u00d7 rechingeri is often found in the temperate regions of Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
