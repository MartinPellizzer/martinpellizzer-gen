    "intro": "Euphorbia spicata, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Euphorbia spicata requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
