    "intro": "Epipactis ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces striking, spurred orchid flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its flowers are pollinated by insects. Epipactis ovalifolia is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local biodiversity through its ecological interactions."
