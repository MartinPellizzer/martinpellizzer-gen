    "intro": "Embryopteris racemosa, commonly known as the racemose water fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. It is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it can be found in various regions with suitable wetland habitats. Embryopteris racemosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter and food for small aquatic organisms."
