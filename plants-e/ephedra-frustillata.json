    "intro": "Ephedra frustillata, commonly known as the smooth ephedra, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and has distinctive, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Ephedra frustillata is part of the Ephedraceae family, which is closely related to the Gnetophyta, a group of gymnosperms. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
