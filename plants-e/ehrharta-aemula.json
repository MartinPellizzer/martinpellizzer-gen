    "intro": "Ehrharta aemula, commonly known as common Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 2\u201310 cm long. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in warm climates and is highly adaptable, often forming dense mats that can dominate various habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions outside its native range."
