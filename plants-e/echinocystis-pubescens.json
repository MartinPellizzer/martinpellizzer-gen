    "intro": "Echinocystis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy ant vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its tendrils that help it climb supports. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by green, hairy fruits that mature to a red-orange color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its common name. Echinocystis pubescens is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
