    "intro": "Eragrostis reptans var. pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf silky grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of southern Africa. It features narrow, hairless leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or disturbed areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
