    "intro": "Euphorbia obtusifolia var. pseudodendroides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy stems that are often branched and can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered with a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
