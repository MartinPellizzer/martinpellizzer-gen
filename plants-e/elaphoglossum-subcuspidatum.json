    "intro": "Elaphoglossum subcuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending in habit. The plant features small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae with a distinct, subacute to acute apex. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the abaxial side of the fronds, typically covered by a protective indusium."
