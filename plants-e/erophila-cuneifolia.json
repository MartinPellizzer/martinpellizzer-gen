    "intro": "Erophila cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf erophila, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual with slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and disturbed habitats. Erophila cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
