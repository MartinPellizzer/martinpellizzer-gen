    "intro": "Erica erasmia, commonly known as the Erasmus heath, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family (Ericaceae). It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape province, where it grows in coastal fynbos vegetation. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica erasmia is a low-growing shrub, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with evergreen foliage. It is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats."
