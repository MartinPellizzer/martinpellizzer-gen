    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf willow, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
