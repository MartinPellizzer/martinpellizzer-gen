It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
