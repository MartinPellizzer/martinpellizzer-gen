    "intro": "Elaeocarpus hebridarum, commonly known as the Hebridean elaeocarp, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the western Pacific region. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
