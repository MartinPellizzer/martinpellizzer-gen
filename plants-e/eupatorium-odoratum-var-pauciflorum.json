    "intro": "Eupatorium odoratum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the fragrant boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, wooded areas. The plant's botanical features make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
