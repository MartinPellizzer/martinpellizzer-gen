    "intro": "Eunanus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and blue-gray on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dryland gardens."
