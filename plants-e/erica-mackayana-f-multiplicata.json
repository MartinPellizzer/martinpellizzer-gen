    "intro": "Erica mackayana f. multiplicata, commonly known as the Cape heath or dwarf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of small, needle-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers in late summer, which are borne in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
