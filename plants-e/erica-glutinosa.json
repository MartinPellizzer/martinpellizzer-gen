    "intro": "Erica glutinosa, commonly known as sticky heath, is a shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its sticky leaves, which give it its common name, help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erica glutinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
