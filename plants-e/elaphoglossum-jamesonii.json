    "intro": "Elaphoglossum jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters known as sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering called a indusium. Elaphoglossum jamesonii is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in humid, temperate climates."
