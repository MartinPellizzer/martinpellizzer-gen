    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum f. leucocarpum, commonly known as white-fruited crowberry, is a variant of the crowberry plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing shrub with small, dark green leaves that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale red berries that are distinct from the typical black berries of the species. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and tundra environments. The white fruiting form is a notable botanical feature that distinguishes this cultivar from the standard variety."
