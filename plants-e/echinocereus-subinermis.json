    "intro": "Echinocereus subinermis, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered with white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its adaptations to arid environments, it is relatively drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
