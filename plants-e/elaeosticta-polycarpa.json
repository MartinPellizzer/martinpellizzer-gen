    "intro": "Elaeosticta polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited elaeosticta, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and legume fruits. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which attract various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open to release the seeds upon maturity. Elaeosticta polycarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
