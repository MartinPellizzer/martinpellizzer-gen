    "intro": "Epilobium alsinifolium, commonly known as willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy pink to purple flowers in spikes. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Epilobium alsinifolium is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
