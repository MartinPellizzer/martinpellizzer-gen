    "intro": "Epilobium melanocaulon var. typicum, commonly known as the blackstem willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and marshy areas. The plant features slender, often reddish stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and arranged in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
