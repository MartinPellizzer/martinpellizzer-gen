    "intro": "Euphorbia marschalliana subsp. woronowii, commonly known as the Woolly Spurge, is a succulent plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, providing a protective layer against drought and herbivory. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in yellow or greenish hues, which are typically followed by unique, cup-shaped seed pods. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant."
