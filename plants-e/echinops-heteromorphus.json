    "intro": "Echinops heteromorphus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, spiky structure. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Echinops heteromorphus is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments."
