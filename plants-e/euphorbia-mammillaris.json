    "intro": "Euphorbia mammillaris, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with its short, thick stems and clusters of small, green, thorn-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
