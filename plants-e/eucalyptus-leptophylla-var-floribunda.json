    "intro": "Eucalyptus leptophylla var. floribunda, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are often visited by honeyeaters and other nectar-feeding birds. Its bark is smooth and peels off in thin layers, and it is often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
