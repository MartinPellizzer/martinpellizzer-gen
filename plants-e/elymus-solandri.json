    "intro": "Elymus solandri, commonly known as the coastal wild rye, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Elymus solandri is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
