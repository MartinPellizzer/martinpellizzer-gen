    "intro": "Ervum agrigentinum, commonly known as the Sicilian vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces elongated, hairy pods containing several seeds. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
