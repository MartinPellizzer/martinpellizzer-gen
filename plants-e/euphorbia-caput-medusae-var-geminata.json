    "intro": "Euphorbia caput-medusae var. geminata, commonly known as the \"Medusa's Head\" or \"Devil's Fig,\" is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem with a distinctive crown of fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that resemble a crown or a flower. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green, surrounded by a fleshy, cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
