    "intro": "Epipogium kentingense, commonly known as the Kenting ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Taiwan. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers with a unique, intricate structure. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
