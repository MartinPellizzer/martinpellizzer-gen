    "intro": "Eugenia malacantha, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dense, fragrant foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent, while its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color. Eugenia malacantha thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils."
