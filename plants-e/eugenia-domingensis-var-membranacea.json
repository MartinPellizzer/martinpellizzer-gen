    "intro": "Eugenia domingensis var. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine, membranous layer, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round berry with a thin, edible skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits in suitable climates."
