It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Euphrasia alpina var. vestita is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported eye health benefits."
