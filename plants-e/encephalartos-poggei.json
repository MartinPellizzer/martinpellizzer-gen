    "intro": "Encephalartos poggei, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal encephalartos, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of long, strap-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its limited natural range and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
