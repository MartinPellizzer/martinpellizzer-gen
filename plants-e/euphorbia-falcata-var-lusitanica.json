    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a crown-like structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
