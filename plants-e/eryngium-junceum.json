    "intro": "Eryngium junceum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green leaves and striking, thistle-like purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its unique morphology helps it withstand salt spray and strong winds. Eryngium junceum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
