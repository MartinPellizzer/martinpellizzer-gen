    "intro": "Eritrichium procumbens, commonly known as the creeping mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, hairy leaves and produces delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh environments. Eritrichium procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
