    "intro": "Epidendrum commelinoides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a rhizomatous growth habit, featuring a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum commelinoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
