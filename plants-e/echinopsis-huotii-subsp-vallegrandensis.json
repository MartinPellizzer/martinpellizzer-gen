    "intro": "Echinopsis huotii subsp. vallegrandensis, commonly known as the Valle Grande echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and prominent spines, which provide protection against herbivores and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping in regions with similar climatic conditions."
