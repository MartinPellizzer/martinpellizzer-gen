    "intro": "Elaphoglossum subandinum, commonly known as the Andean holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum subandinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
