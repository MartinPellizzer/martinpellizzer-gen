    "intro": "Espeletia frontinoensis, commonly known as the Frontino heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, white hairs, which reduce water loss in arid conditions. Espeletia frontinoensis is an important component of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, contributing to the region's biodiversity and ecological stability."
