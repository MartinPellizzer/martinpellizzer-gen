    "intro": "Euphorbia vinyalsii, commonly known as the Canary Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, somewhat ribbed leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 that are clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
