    "intro": "Euphorbia collina, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia collina is also known for its latex sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
