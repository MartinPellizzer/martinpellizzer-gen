    "intro": "Escobedia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered escobedia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence. This plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The showy, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Escobedia longiflora is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
