    "intro": "Erysimum saxatile, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known flowering plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. The leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
