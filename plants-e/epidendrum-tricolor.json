    "intro": "Epidendrum tricolor, commonly known as the three-color orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features strikingly colorful flowers with three distinct color zones, typically red, yellow, and green. Its leaves are elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Epidendrum tricolor thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
