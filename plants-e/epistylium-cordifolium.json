    "intro": "Epistylium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved epistylium, is a colonial marine invertebrate belonging to the order Rhodactynida. It forms dense, bush-like colonies composed of interconnected zooids, each with a transparent, tubular body. The plant's most distinctive feature is its heart-shaped, leaf-like structures called \"costae,\" which are used for attachment and gas exchange. These structures are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the central axis of the colony. Epistylium cordifolium is found in shallow coastal waters and plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
