    "intro": "Eragrostis senegalensis, commonly known as Sudan grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, typical of the grass family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used for forage and soil stabilization. Eragrostis senegalensis is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
