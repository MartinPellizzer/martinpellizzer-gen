    "intro": "Eucalyptus armillata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrubs or small trees. The plant has aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. It produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Eucalyptus armillata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian vegetation."
