    "intro": "Eriosorus paucifolius, commonly known as the sparse-leaved eriosorus, is a small, herbaceous fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in relatively undisturbed, humid ecosystems."
