    "intro": "Eremurus spectabilis subsp. subalbiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered sasparilla, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears numerous white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
