    "intro": "Euterpe dominicana, commonly known as the Dominican palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Dominican Republic. It is a medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with a slender trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of edible fruits resembling small, sweet, yellow-orange berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts, and the plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
