    "intro": "Eulophia leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Africa. It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, allowing it to survive in its often-dry habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it often grows in shaded, moist environments. Eulophia leopoldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
