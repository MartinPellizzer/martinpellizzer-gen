    "intro": "Epilobium erosum, commonly known as redstem weed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, reddish stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters at the ends of the branches. Epilobium erosum is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and birds."
