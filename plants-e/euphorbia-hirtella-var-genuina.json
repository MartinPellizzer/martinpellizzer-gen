    "intro": "Euphorbia hirtella var. genuina, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, hairy foliage and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia. The plant has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, a common characteristic among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in xeriscaping and desert gardens."
