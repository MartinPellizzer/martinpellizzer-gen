    "intro": "Elisma natans var. repens, commonly known as creeping water-plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and aquatic environments in North America. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to thrive in shallow, still waters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. Elisma natans var. repens plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by improving water quality and supporting biodiversity."
