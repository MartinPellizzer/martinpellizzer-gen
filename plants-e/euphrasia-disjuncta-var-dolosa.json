    "intro": "Euphrasia disjuncta var. dolosa, commonly known as the yellow tailed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with two lips that are distinctly shaped. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. The leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
