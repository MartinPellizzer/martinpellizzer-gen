    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. arcticum, commonly known as Arctic Horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in arctic and alpine regions. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are used for reproduction. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is often part of the vegetation in tundra ecosystems."
