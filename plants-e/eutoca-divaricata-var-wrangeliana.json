    "intro": "Eutoca divaricata var. wrangeliana, commonly known as Wrangel's eutoca, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
