    "intro": "Eriocaulon piliphorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its flowers are usually inconspicuous, with tiny, three-parted structures that facilitate wind pollination. Eriocaulon piliphorum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
