It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and wetlands. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in wet conditions and compete effectively with crops. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many parts of the world."
