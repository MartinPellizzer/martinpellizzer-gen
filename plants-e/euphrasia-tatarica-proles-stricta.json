    "intro": "Euphrasia tatarica proles stricta, commonly known as the strict euphrasia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-orange flowers with prominent dark markings, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the colder regions of Eastern Europe and Siberia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens in suitable climates."
