    "intro": "Eritrichium pulchellum, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. Eritrichium pulchellum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments."
