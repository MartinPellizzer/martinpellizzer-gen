    "intro": "Erythraea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal erythraea, is a rare flowering plant native to the sandy shores of the Mediterranean. It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas."
