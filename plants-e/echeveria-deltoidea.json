    "intro": "Echeveria deltoidea, commonly known as the Delta Echeveria, is a species of flowering plant in the Crassulaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the spring and summer months. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Echeveria deltoidea thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot."
