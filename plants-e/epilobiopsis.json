These plants are typically herbaceous, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. They produce showy, often pink or purple flowers that are clustered in racemes. Epilobiopsis species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
