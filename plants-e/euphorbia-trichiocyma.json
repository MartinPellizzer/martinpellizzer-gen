    "intro": "Euphorbia trichiocyma, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-green foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a noxious weed."
