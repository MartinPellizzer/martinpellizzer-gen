    "intro": "Eragrostis tenella subvar. lasiantha, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of dryland vegetation and a potential forage plant for livestock."
