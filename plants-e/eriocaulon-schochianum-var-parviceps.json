    "intro": "Eriocaulon schochianum var. parviceps, commonly known as the small-headed marsh sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often found in marshes and swampy areas. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to waterlogged soils, with rhizomes that aid in nutrient absorption and stabilization."
