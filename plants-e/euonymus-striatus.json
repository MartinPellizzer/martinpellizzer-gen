    "intro": "Euonymus striatus, commonly known as the striped euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features striking, alternate, ovate leaves with prominent white veins that create a distinctive striped appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
