    "intro": "Eugenia crenata, commonly known as the wax apple or Java apple, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible, though they are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Eugenia crenata thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit."
