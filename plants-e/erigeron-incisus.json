    "intro": "Erigeron incisus, commonly known as the cutleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows and disturbed soils, and it produces showy white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a fuzzy texture, which helps distinguish it from similar species. Erigeron incisus is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
