    "intro": "Eucalyptus punctata, commonly known as the white box, is a tall, slender tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin sheets, and its lance-shaped, grey-green leaves that are often dotted with small oil glands. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that turn from green to red or yellow as they mature. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Eucalyptus punctata is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native animals."
