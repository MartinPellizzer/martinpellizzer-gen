    "intro": "Erica aristata var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and pale purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
