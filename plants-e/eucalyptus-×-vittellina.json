    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 vittellina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic, elliptical seeds. Eucalyptus \u00d7 vittellina is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a slow growth rate. It is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
