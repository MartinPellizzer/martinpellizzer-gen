    "intro": "Eucalyptus clavigera var. diffusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a variant of the ghost gum tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its bark is smooth and peels off in thin, fibrous strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
