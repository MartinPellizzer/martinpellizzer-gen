It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Eriope platanthera is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native range."
