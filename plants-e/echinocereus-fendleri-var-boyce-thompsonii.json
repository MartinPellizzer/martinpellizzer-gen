    "intro": "Echinocereus fendleri var. boyce-thompsonii, commonly known as the Boyce-Thompson prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a dense, compact growth habit and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, and its waxy coating helps reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh climates."
