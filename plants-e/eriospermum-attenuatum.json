    "intro": "Eriospermum attenuatum, commonly known as the slender eriosperm, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hairy capsule that aids in wind dispersal. Eriospermum attenuatum is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
