    "intro": "Echeveria angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf echeveria, is a species of succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are narrow and pointed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Echeveria angusta is popular in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
