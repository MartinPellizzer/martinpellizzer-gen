    "intro": "Eriophorum brachyantherum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cotton-grass, is a herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in its habitat. Eriophorum brachyantherum plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
