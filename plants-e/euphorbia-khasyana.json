    "intro": "Euphorbia khasyana, commonly known as the Khasi spurge, is a succulent plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia khasyana is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
