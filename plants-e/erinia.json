    "intro": "Erinia, commonly known as the common ergot, is a parasitic plant that infects the spikes of rye and other grasses. It produces a dark, hard sclerotium that contains alkaloids, which can be toxic to humans and animals. The plant belongs to the Claviceps genus and is part of the fungal kingdom, not a true plant. Its presence can lead to ergotism, a serious illness affecting the nervous system. Erinia has historical significance in both agriculture and medicine due to its complex chemical composition."
