    "intro": "Elaphoglossum amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive harts-tongue shape at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum amazonicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
