    "intro": "Erica erinus, commonly known as the winter beauty or evergreen heath, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces pink, white, or purple blooms during the winter months, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica erinus thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
