    "intro": "Ephedra strongylensis, commonly known as the desert tea, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and contains alkaloids, including ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been the subject of both traditional use and modern pharmacological research."
