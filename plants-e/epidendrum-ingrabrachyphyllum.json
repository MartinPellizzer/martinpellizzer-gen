    "intro": "Epidendrum ingrabrachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-stemmed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively short, robust stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a fine, velvety texture. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
