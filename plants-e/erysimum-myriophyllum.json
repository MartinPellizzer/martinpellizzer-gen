    "intro": "Erysimum myriophyllum, commonly known as the many-leaved wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, fern-like foliage and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a soft, hairy texture, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Erysimum myriophyllum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
