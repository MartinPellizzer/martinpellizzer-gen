    "intro": "Epidendrum heteroglossum, commonly known as the variegated epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features elongated pseudobulbs covered in a thick, leathery sheath, with long, narrow leaves that are often variegated in color. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Epidendrum heteroglossum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation."
