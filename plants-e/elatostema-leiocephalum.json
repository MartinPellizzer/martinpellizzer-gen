    "intro": "Elatostema leiocephalum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps retain moisture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Elatostema leiocephalum is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant."
