    "intro": "Eriocaulon yaoshanense var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the short-lobed marsh plant, is a rare aquatic plant native to China. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it reproduces through seeds and vegetative propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
