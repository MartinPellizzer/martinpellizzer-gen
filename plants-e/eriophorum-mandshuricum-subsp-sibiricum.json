    "intro": "Eriophorum mandshuricum subsp. sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton, which are produced at the ends of its stems. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs, marshes, and tundra, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette at the base, while the stems are short and often reclining. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
