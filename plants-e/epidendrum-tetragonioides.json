    "intro": "Epidendrum tetragonioides, commonly known as the Four-angled Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate to high humidity for optimal growth. Epidendrum tetragonioides is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
