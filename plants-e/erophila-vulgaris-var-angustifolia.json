    "intro": "Erophila vulgaris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It has slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. The plant is adapted to slow-moving or still waters and can form dense underwater vegetation. It plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish. However, it can also become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species."
