    "intro": "Euphorbia systyloides var. pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
