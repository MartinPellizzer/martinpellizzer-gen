    "intro": "Euonymus capillaceus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, bead-like fruits that persist into the winter. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
