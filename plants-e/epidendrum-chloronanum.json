    "intro": "Epidendrum chloronanum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, thin stems and striking white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in wetlands. Its leaves are typically dark green and lance-shaped, and it prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many areas."
