    "intro": "Euphorbia moehringioides, commonly known as the Moehring's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branched stem covered in soft, greenish-gray foliage. The plant produces striking yellow-orange cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
