    "intro": "Echeveria eximia, commonly known as the Mexican snowball, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
