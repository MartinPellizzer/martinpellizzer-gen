    "intro": "Epidryos allenii, commonly known as the Allen's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Epidryos allenii is known for its slow growth and is often found in cloud forests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
