    "intro": "Euphorbia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, waxy leaves that wrap around the stem, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought. Euphorbia amplexicaulis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive foliage and resilience."
