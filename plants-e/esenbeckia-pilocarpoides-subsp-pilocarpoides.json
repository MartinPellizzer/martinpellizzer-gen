    "intro": "Esenbeckia pilocarpoides subsp. pilocarpoides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its dense, hard wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
