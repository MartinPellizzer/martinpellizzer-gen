It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and spore-bearing structures called strobila. The plant retains its foliage through the winter, giving it its \"persistent\" name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
