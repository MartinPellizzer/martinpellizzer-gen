    "intro": "Enneapogon avenaceus, commonly known as purple threeawn, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-colored awns. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and savanna habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. Enneapogon avenaceus is also used in some regions for forage and has ecological significance in supporting native wildlife."
