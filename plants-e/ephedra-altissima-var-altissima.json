    "intro": "Ephedra altissima var. altissima, commonly known as the tall ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures. Its stems contain alkaloids, which have historically been used in traditional medicine."
