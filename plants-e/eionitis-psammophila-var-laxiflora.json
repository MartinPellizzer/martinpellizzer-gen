    "intro": "Eionitis psammophila var. laxiflora, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
