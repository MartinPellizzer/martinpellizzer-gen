    "intro": "Eryngiophyllum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the small, yellow flowers. These bracts are often mistaken for leaves, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. Eryngiophyllum species are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
