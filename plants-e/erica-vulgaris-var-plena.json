    "intro": "Erica vulgaris var. plena, commonly known as the common heather, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and red, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to form thick, cushion-like growths."
