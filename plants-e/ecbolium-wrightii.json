It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
