    "intro": "Euphorbia neogillettii, commonly known as the Natal spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems for survival. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
