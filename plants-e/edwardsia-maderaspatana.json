    "intro": "Edwardsia maderaspatana, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and glossy in appearance. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered in its native range."
