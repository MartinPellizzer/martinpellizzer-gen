    "intro": "Euphorbia flexicaulis, commonly known as the flexible spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia flexicaulis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
