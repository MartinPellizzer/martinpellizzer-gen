    "intro": "Elaphoglossum peltatum f. peltatum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a golden hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
