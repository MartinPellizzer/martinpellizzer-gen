    "intro": "Euonymus radicans var. alticola, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its dense, ground-covering growth habit. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in gardens and as a soil stabilizer in erosion-prone areas."
