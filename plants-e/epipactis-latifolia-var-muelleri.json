    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. muelleri, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, greenish-yellow flower spikes that bear showy, lip-like petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It produces small, greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This variety is often found in association with other orchid species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
