    "intro": "Erica intermedia, commonly known as the common heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in heathlands and coastal areas. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica intermedia is known for its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
