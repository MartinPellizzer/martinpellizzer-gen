    "intro": "Epidendrum rhodoides, commonly known as the red-veined epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a deep red or purple veining. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum rhodoides is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
