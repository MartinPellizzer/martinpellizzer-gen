    "intro": "Erica scoparia var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming primarily in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes."
