    "intro": "Eria lineoligera, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, linear leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eria lineoligera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
