    "intro": "Eupatorium minutifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1.5 meters tall. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters called cymes, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eupatorium minutifolium is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
