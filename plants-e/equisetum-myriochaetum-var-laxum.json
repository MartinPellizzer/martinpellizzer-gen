    "intro": "Equisetum myriochaetum var. laxum, commonly known as the slender horse tail, is a species of horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are segmented and covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. This variety is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils."
