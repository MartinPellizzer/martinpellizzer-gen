    "intro": "Erodium glabrum, commonly known as common erodium, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces pink to violet flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, hairy capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Erodium glabrum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
