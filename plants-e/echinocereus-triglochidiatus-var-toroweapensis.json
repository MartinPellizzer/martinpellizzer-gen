    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus var. toroweapensis, commonly known as the Toroweap cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated in desert gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal."
