    "intro": "Euonymus vulgaris var. microphyllus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in natural habitats."
