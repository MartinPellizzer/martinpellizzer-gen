    "intro": "Epleienda sinemariensis, commonly known as the Sinemariensis fern, is a rare and delicate plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
