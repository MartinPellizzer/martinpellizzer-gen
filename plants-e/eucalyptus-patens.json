    "intro": "Eucalyptus patens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringy gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is fibrous and peels in thin layers, and the wood is light and soft, making it suitable for certain industrial uses. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
