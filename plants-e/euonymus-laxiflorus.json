    "intro": "Euonymus laxiflorus, commonly known as the laxiflorous spurge, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it has a compact growth habit. Euonymus laxiflorus is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
