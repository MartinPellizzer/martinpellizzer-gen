    "intro": "Erica adenophylla, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Erica adenophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
