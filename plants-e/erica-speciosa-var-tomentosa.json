    "intro": "Erica speciosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, white woolly coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
