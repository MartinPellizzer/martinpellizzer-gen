    "intro": "Eria grandicaulis, commonly known as the giant whorled pogostemon, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, sunny environments. Eria grandicaulis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
