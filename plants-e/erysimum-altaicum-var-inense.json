    "intro": "Erysimum altaicum var. inense, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
