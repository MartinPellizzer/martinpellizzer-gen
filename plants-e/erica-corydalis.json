    "intro": "Erica corydalis, commonly known as the heath orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Erica corydalis produces delicate, bell-shaped blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, often in late spring to early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
