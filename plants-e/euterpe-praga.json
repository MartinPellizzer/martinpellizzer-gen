    "intro": "Euterpe praga, commonly known as the golden palm, is a species of palm native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, gracefully arching trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in branched inflorescences, which are followed by elongated, segmented fruits. The fruits are edible and contain a sweet, juicy pulp surrounded by a fibrous layer. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, Euterpe praga is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
