It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, rough texture. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Eugenia dasyblasta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
