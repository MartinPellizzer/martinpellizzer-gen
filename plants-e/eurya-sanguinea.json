    "intro": "Eurya sanguinea, commonly known as the redleaf eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Eurya sanguinea thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value is due to its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit."
