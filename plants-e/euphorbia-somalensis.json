    "intro": "Euphorbia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which are followed by unique, spherical seed capsules. Euphorbia somalensis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
