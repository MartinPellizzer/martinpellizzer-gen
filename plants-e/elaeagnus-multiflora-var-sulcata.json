    "intro": "Elaeagnus multiflora var. sulcata, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
