    "intro": "Eucalyptus resinifera var. spectabilis, commonly known as the yellow box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to yellowish bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically yellow or cream in color, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant is also valued for its timber and has cultural significance for some Indigenous Australian communities."
