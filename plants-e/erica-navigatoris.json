    "intro": "Erica navigatoris, commonly known as the navigational heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. Erica navigatoris thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
