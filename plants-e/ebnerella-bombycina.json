It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Ebnerella bombycina is typically found in riparian zones and is well adapted to moist environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution along riverbanks and wetlands."
