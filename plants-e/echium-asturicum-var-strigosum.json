    "intro": "Echium asturicum var. strigosum, commonly known as the Asturian thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and striking purple-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, coastal or mountainous habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native environment."
