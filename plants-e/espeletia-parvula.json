    "intro": "Espeletia parvula, commonly known as the \"Cumbal\" or \"P\u00e1ramo flower,\" is a flowering plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, showy inflorescences that bloom in the late summer. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with poor soil. Its structure includes thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Espeletia parvula plays an important ecological role in its native range, contributing to biodiversity and providing nectar for pollinators."
