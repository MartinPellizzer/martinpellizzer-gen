    "intro": "Euphorbia hirsuta f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a variant of the hairy spurge characterized by its reduced pubescence. It is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant features a woody stem with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically smaller and less hairy compared to the typical form. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick stems and leaves."
