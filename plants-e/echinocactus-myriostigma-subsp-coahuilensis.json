    "intro": "Echinocactus myriostigma subsp. coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila hedgehog cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which are typical of the genus Echinocactus. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, ribbed structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and is considered a rare species in the wild."
