    "intro": "Eriachne fastigiata, commonly known as the spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. Eriachne fastigiata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
