    "intro": "Eremophila koobabbiensis, commonly known as the Koobabbin emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is adapted to drought and heat, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
