    "intro": "Euphrasia nummularia, commonly known as the pennywort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Euphrasia nummularia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
