    "intro": "Erigeron pulvinatus, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant's scientific name reflects its distinctive pulvinate (rounded) flower head and its hairy stems."
