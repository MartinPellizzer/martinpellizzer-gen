    "intro": "Erodium hirtum var. maroccanum, commonly known as the Moroccan stickyweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Morocco. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain several seeds that are dispersed by wind."
