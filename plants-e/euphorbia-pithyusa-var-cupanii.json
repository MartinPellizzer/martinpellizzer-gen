    "intro": "Euphorbia pithyusa var. cupanii, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that is often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
