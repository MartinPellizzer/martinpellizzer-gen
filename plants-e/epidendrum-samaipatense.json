    "intro": "Epidendrum samaipatense, commonly known as the Samaipata orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters, with a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. Epidendrum samaipatense thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
