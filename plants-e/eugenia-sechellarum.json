    "intro": "Eugenia sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its fruit, which is a small, fleshy berry, contains seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
