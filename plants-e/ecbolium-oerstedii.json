    "intro": "Ecbolium oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's ecbolium, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, woolly foliage and showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in pine flatwoods and wetlands, preferring partial to full shade. Its limited geographic range and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for conservation botanists."
