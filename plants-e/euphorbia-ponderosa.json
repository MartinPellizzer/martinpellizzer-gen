    "intro": "Euphorbia ponderosa, commonly known as the giant spurge or desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is often cracked and flaky, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia ponderosa is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert landscapes."
