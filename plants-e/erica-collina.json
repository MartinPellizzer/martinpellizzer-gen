It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. This evergreen shrub typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to maritime climates. Erica collina produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
