    "intro": "Echium dahuricum, commonly known as Siberian Thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and striking purple-blue flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant produces a large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Echium dahuricum is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
