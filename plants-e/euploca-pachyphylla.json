It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure to ensure optimal growth. Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
