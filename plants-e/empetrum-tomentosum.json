    "intro": "Empetrum tomentosum, commonly known as the snowberry or white crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Empetrum tomentosum thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
