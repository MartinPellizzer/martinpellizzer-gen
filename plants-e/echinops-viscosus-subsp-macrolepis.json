    "intro": "Echinops viscosus subsp. macrolepis, commonly known as the sticky globe thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spiny spherical heads composed of tightly packed blue to purple bracts. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the development of spiky, woody fruits. Its leaves are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
