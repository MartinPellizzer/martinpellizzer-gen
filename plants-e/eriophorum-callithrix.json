    "intro": "Eriophorum callithrix, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton, which are composed of small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wetland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing, mat-forming structure. Eriophorum callithrix plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic invertebrates."
