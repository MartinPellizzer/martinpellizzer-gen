    "intro": "Euphorbia vachellii, commonly known as the vachellii spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic. Euphorbia vachellii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
