    "intro": "Ephedra, commonly known as ma huang, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ephedraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. The plant is characterized by its simple, linear leaves and small, greenish flowers. Its stems contain ephedrine, a stimulant alkaloid that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. However, due to its potential for abuse and toxicity, ephedra is now regulated in many countries."
