    "intro": "Epidendrum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, often in clusters along the stems. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Epidendrum bulbosum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
