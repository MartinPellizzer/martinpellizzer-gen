    "intro": "Elatine hastata var. purpurea, commonly known as purple waterwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, which gives it its common name. Its tiny, opposite leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length and have a smooth or slightly toothed edge. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
