    "intro": "Eucalyptus urceolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which appear during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-resistant species. The bark of Eucalyptus urceolaris is often flaky and peels off in thin layers, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
