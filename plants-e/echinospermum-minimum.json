    "intro": "Echinospermum minimum, commonly known as the small spiny dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, spiny leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its seeds are surrounded by a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Echinospermum minimum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
