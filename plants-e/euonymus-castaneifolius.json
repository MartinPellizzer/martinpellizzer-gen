    "intro": "Euonymus castaneifolius, commonly known as the maple-leafed euonymus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, typically turning vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red capsules that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its adaptability and seasonal color changes contribute to its aesthetic appeal in landscaping."
