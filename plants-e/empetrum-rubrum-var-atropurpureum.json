    "intro": "Empetrum rubrum var. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple willow-rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that often turn reddish-purple in autumn. The plant produces tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in acidic, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its ornamental value is due to its compact form and seasonal color changes."
