    "intro": "Etlingera dictyota, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Etlingera dictyota is considered an endangered species."
