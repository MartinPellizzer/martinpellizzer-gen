    "intro": "Euphorbia candelabrum var. bilocularis, commonly known as the candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem that resembles a candlestick, with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers emerging from the axils of the leaves. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited to arid environments. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water conditions make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The variety bilocularis is distinguished by its two-lobed leaf structure, adding to its ornamental appeal."
