    "intro": "Erodium chium subsp. littoreum, commonly known as sea heartweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy environment. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
