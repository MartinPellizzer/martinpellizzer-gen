    "intro": "Eulophia mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces a single, often branched inflorescence bearing showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are fleshy and strap-shaped, adapted to arid conditions. Eulophia mossambicensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and bright, indirect light."
