    "intro": "Erythroxylum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf erythroxylum, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage. However, it is not related to the coca plant and does not contain the psychoactive alkaloids found in other species of the genus."
