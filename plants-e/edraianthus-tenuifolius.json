    "intro": "Edraianthus tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved edraianthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
