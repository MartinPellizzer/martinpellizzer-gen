    "intro": "Euonymus fortunei var. villosus, commonly known as the curly willow or silver leaf euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and distinctive, waxy, silver-gray foliage. The leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"villosus\" designation, which means \"hairy\" in Latin. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are ornamental but not edible. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover."
