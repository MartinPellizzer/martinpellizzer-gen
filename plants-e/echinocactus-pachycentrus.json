    "intro": "Echinocactus pachycentrus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are typically pale yellow or white, providing protection from herbivores. Echinocactus pachycentrus is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
