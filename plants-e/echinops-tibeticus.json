    "intro": "Echinops tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a crown of thorns. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to extreme conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Echinops tibeticus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
