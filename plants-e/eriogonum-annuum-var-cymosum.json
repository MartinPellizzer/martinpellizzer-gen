It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give its leaves a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of yellow to reddish flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of ecological study."
