    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. leptostachyum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are often clustered in a distinctive, spike-like arrangement. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its primitive appearance and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
