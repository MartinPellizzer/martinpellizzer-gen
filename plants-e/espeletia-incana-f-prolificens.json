    "intro": "Espeletia incana f. prolificens, commonly known as the woolly tree heath, is a distinctive plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage that covers its entire body, giving it a unique, almost otherworldly appearance. The plant is a member of the Asteraceae family and is often found in high-altitude environments, such as p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in a showy, umbel-like arrangement. This species is adapted to cold, humid climates and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
