    "intro": "Euphorbia crispa, commonly known as the crinkled spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching stem covered in small, fleshy leaves that are often crinkled or curled. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution."
