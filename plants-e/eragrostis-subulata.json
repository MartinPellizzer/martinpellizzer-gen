    "intro": "Eragrostis subulata, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant."
