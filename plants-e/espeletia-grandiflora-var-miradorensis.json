    "intro": "Espeletia grandiflora var. miradorensis, commonly known as the Mirador cushion plant, is a species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of silver-gray foliage, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking white to pale purple flower heads that bloom in late spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above 3,000 meters, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems."
