    "intro": "Eupatorium serratifolium, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically serrated and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. Eupatorium serratifolium is often found in moist, open habitats like meadows and woodland edges."
