    "intro": "Epilobium ciliatum subsp. watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's willowherb, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy pink to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely ciliate (fringed) leaves and often occurs in moist, disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. It is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
