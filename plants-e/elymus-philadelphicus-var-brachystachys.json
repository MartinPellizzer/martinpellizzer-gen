    "intro": "Elymus philadelphicus var. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
