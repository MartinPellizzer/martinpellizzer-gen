    "intro": "Euonymus frigidus var. wardii, commonly known as the Ward's wintercreeper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the winter, providing visual interest in cold climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. It is often cultivated as a ground cover or in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in partial shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological and ornamental purposes in temperate regions."
