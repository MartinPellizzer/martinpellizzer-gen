    "intro": "Elaphoglossum jucundum, commonly known as the happy holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. Elaphoglossum jucundum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
