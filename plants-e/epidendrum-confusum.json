    "intro": "Epidendrum confusum, commonly known as the confused epidendron, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing multiple stems that branch out from the base. The plant features broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and come in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a contrasting lip. Epidendrum confusum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
