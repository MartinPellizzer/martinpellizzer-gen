It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces white to pale blue ray flowers surrounded by yellow disk flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage is usually hairy and gray-green, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
