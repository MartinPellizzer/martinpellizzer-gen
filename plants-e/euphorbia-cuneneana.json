    "intro": "Euphorbia cuneneana, commonly known as the Cunene spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems for survival during dry periods. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
