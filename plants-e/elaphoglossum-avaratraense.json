    "intro": "Elaphoglossum avaratraense, commonly known as the Madagascar holly fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Elaphoglossum avaratraense is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
