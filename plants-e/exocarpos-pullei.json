    "intro": "Exocarpos pullei, commonly known as the rough sour orange, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody, spiny fruits. The fruits are typically harvested when they turn a deep red or orange, and they contain a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, acidic pulp. This species is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
