    "intro": "Echinochloa oryzicola, commonly known as false rice, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and other moist environments, where it can become invasive. Due to its similarity to cultivated rice, it is sometimes mistaken for a crop and can pose challenges in agricultural settings."
