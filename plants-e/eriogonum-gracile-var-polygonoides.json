    "intro": "Eriogonum gracile var. polygonoides, commonly known as the slender buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. It is also an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
