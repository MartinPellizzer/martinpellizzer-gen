    "intro": "Epidorkis, commonly known as the sticky orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. These plants are characterized by their unique, often sticky or resinous secretions on their stems and leaves. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors, though they are not as showy as other orchid species. Epidorkis plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
