    "intro": "Euonymus alternifolius, commonly known as the alternate-leaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of leaves, which are typically oval and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are ornamental and attract wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes contribute to its horticultural value."
