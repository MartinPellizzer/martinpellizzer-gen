    "intro": "Erysimum arenicola, commonly known as the sandstone wallflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its foliage is typically narrow and gray-green, helping it conserve moisture. Erysimum arenicola is often found growing on cliffs, slopes, and in dry, calcareous soils."
