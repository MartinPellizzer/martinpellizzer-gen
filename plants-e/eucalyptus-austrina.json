    "intro": "Eucalyptus austrina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and small, narrow leaves that are often gray-green in color. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Eucalyptus austrina is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
