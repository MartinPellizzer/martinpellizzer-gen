    "intro": "Epilobium minutum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth willow herb, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrum is distinguished by its smoother foliage. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
