    "intro": "Eria foetida, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a tropical plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to regions in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and a distinctive, unpleasant odor that resembles decay. Eria foetida typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its unique scent is believed to attract specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles."
