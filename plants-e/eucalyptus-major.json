    "intro": "Eucalyptus major, commonly known as the rough-barked apple, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that reveals a fibrous underlayer, and its lance-shaped, grey-green leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody, spherical capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus major is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, have been used in traditional medicine and for their antiseptic properties."
