    "intro": "Eragrostis benguelensis, commonly known as the Benguela grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eragrostis benguelensis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
