    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. labradoricum, commonly known as Labrador willow-herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as bogs and stream banks, and is adapted to moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, ascending stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface. Its flowers are small, pink to reddish-purple, and arranged in spikes, blooming in late summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
