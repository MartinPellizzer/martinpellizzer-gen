It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and distinctive, elongated floral structures that resemble beaks, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Euzomodendraceae, which is a small and specialized group of flowering plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
