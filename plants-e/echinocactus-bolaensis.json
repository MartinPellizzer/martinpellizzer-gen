    "intro": "Echinocactus bolaensis, commonly known as the Bola\u00f1os cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It has spines that are often yellow or reddish, providing protection from herbivores. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
