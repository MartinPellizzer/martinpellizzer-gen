It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry environments. It has small, compound leaves and produces legume-like pods that contain its seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
