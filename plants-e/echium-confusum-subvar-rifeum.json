    "intro": "Echium confusum subvar. rifeum, commonly known as the red-tinged evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
