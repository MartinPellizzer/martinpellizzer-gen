It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that give way to edible, orange-red berries. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for challenging soils. Elaeagnus erosifolia is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, which improves soil fertility."
