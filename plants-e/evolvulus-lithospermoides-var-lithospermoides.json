    "intro": "Evolvulus lithospermoides var. lithospermoides, commonly known as the rock pepper or desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual herb with small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Its fruits are small, round capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to desert conditions."
