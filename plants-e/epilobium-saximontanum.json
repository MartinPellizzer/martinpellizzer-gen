    "intro": "Epilobium saximontanum, commonly known as the alpine willow or mountain willow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Epilobium saximontanum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
