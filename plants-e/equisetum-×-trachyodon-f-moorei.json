    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 trachyodon f. moorei, commonly known as the Moore's horse-tail, is a hybrid fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It exhibits a distinctive morphology with a tall, segmented stem and whorled leaves that resemble the bristles of a horse's tail. This plant is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of its ancient lineage. The species is noted for its primitive structure and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
