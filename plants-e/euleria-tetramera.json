    "intro": "Euleria tetramera, commonly known as the four-lobed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Euleria tetramera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
