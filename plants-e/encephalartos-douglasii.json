    "intro": "Encephalartos douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas\u2019s cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that are typically borne on the trunk, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky, coastal areas. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
