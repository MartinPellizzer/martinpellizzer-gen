    "intro": "Euphorbia puberula, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in prairies and disturbed soils. Euphorbia puberula is also known for its latex sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
