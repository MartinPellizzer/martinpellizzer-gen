    "intro": "Eupatorium nemorosum, commonly known as boneset, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have serrated edges, while the plant produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Historically, boneset has been used in herbal medicine for its purported fever-reducing and anti-inflammatory properties."
