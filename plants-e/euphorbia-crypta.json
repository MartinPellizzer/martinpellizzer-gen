    "intro": "Euphorbia crypta, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Euphorbia crypta is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in dry conditions."
