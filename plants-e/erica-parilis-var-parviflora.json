    "intro": "Erica parilis var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It features dense, leathery foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires full sun to partial shade. This hardy species is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and resilience to coastal conditions."
