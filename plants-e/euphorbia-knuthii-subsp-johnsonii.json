    "intro": "Euphorbia knuthii subsp. johnsonii, commonly known as Knuth's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features a compact, rounded rosette of thick, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that store water, adapting to its dry environment. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique floral structures, typically appearing in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
