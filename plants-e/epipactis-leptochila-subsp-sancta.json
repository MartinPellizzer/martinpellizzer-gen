    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila subsp. sancta, commonly known as the Santa Cruz helleborine, is a herbaceous perennial orchid native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, hood-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. It has a complex root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
