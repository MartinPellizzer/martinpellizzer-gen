It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and produces striking spikes of violet-blue flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
