    "intro": "Encephalartos latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved cycad, is a species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their large, spiny structures. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
