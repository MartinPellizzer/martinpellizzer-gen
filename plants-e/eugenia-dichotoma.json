    "intro": "Eugenia dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Eugenia dichotoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, making it a useful plant in both horticulture and local agriculture."
