    "intro": "Erythrina setosa, commonly known as the scarlet coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, reddish hairs. Erythrina setosa is a legume, meaning it belongs to the Fabaceae family, and it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like or small tree-like, making it a popular ornamental plant in warmer climates."
