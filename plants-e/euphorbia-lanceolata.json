    "intro": "Euphorbia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branched stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Euphorbia lanceolata is known for its ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it a common sight in riparian zones."
