    "intro": "Eriophorum fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its stems. This plant thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, often forming dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. Eriophorum fauriei plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is an indicator species for nutrient-poor, waterlogged habitats."
