    "intro": "Erica herbacea, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It is well adapted to harsh climates, with a compact form that helps it withstand strong winds and drought. Erica herbacea is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
