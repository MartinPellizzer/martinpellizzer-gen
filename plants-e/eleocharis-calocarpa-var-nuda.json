    "intro": "Eleocharis calocarpa var. nuda, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has cylindrical, unbranched stems that are usually smooth and covered with small, scale-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each containing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is characterized by its reduced floral structures and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
