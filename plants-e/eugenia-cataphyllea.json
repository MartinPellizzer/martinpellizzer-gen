    "intro": "Eugenia cataphyllea, commonly known as the velvetwood or blackwood, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal habitats. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
