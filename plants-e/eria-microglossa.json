    "intro": "Eria microglossa, commonly known as the small-lipped eria, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is narrower than the other petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eria microglossa is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
