It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers arranged in elongated spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
