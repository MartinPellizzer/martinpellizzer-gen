    "intro": "Erica droseroides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sundew, is a small, mat-forming plant native to the moist, acidic heathlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tiny, sticky glands that secrete a mucilage to trap insects, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers appearing in summer. Its leaves are glandular and appear as a rosette, contributing to its appearance of being covered in dew. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique carnivorous behavior."
