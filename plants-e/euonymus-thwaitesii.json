    "intro": "Euonymus thwaitesii, commonly known as the Chinese burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its striking red foliage that turns vibrant shades of orange and red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. Its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to urban conditions make it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
