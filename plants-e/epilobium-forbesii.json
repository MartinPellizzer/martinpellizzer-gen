It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are showy, with five pink to purple petals, and are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
