    "intro": "Epidendrum sulfuratorium, commonly known as the sulfur epidendrum, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that range from yellow to orange, often with a sulfur-like scent. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. The species is notable for its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable plant."
