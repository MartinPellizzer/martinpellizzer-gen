    "intro": "Elytrigia elongata subsp. turcica, commonly known as Turkish bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
