    "intro": "Epidendrum caudatum, commonly known as the curly tail orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum caudatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
