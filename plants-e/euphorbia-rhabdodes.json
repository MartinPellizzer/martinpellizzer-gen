    "intro": "Euphorbia rhabdodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, sword-shaped leaves and its production of a milky, toxic sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flower clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by specialized leaves. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling."
