    "intro": "Erodium chium var. catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalaunian senna, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its small, pink to purple flowers bloom in spring, and it produces slender, curved pods that contain several seeds. This variety is considered a minor species within its genus, with limited but notable ecological roles in its native range."
