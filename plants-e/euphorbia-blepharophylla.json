    "intro": "Euphorbia blepharophylla, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized bracts that resemble petals. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy tissues. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
