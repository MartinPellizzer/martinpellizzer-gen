It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. The silky acacia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
