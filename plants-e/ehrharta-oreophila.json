    "intro": "Ehrharta oreophila, commonly known as the mountain lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
