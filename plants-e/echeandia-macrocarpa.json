    "intro": "Echeandia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited Echeandia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, where it grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are typically grayish-green in color. Its showy, five-petaled flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces large, woody capsules as fruit. Echeandia macrocarpa is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
