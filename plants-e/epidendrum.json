    "intro": "Epidendrum, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions across the Americas, Africa, and parts of Asia. Epidendrum species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in rainforests. They produce showy, colorful flowers that can range from white to vibrant red, yellow, or purple. Many Epidendrum species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to care for in home environments."
