    "intro": "Euphorbia invenusta var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for arid landscape designs."
