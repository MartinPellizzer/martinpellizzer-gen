    "intro": "Erica strigilifolia var. strigilifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath or coastal Erica, is a low-growing shrub native to the western coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
