    "intro": "Erioneuron avenaceum, commonly known as the oat grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist or shaded environments. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with pale green to reddish bracts, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Erioneuron avenaceum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
