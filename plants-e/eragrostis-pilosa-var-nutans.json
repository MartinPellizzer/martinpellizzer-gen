It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and erect, branching stems that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red, adding visual interest. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it valuable for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
