It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and unique, cup-like structures called cyathia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
