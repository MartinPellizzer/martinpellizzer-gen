    "intro": "Eugenia maranhaoensis, commonly known as the Maranh\u00e3o guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of northeastern Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and oval-shaped, glossy leaves. It produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a unique flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
