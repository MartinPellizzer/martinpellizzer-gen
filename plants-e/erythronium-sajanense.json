    "intro": "Erythronium sajanense, commonly known as the Sajan dog's-tooth violet, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in coniferous or mixed forests. Its ornamental value has led to increased interest in cultivation, though its conservation status remains a concern due to habitat loss and over-collection."
