    "intro": "Eremanthus verbascifolius, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that resemble those of the mullein plant, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in dry, rocky environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
