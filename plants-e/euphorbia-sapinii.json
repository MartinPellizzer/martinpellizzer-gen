    "intro": "Euphorbia sapinii, commonly known as the Alpine spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium. Euphorbia sapinii is adapted to cold, alpine climates and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
