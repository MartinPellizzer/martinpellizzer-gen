    "intro": "Echeveria lanceolata var. lurida, commonly known as the Ghost Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green with a bluish or purple hue. The leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives the plant its ghostly appearance. It produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or container planting due to its compact size and drought tolerance."
