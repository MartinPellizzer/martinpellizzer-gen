    "intro": "Euphorbia depauperata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, low-growing form with short, fleshy stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
