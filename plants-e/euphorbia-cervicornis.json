    "intro": "Euphorbia cervicornis, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive horn-like structures on its branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions. Euphorbia cervicornis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
