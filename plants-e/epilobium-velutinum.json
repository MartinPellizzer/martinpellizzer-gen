It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or calcareous soils, often found in woodland edges and meadows. It belongs to the Onagraceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological features. Epilobium velutinum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
