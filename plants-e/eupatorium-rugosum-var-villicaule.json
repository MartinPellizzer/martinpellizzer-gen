It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
