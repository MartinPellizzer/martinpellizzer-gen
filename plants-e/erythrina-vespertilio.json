    "intro": "Erythrina vespertilio, commonly known as the evening bat tree, is a striking legume native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its bright red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves with three leaflets, and its stems are often woody and branched. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Erythrina vespertilio is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
