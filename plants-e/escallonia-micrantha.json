    "intro": "Escallonia micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved escallonia, is a shrub native to southern South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers, which bloom in spring and summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant. Escallonia micrantha is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a hardy choice for coastal or dry garden environments."
