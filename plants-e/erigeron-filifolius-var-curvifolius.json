    "intro": "Erigeron filifolius var. curvifolius, commonly known as the curlyleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variant is distinguished by its curved leaflets, which set it apart from other members of the Erigeron genus."
