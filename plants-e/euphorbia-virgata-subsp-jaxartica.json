    "intro": "Euphorbia virgata subsp. jaxartica, commonly known as the Jaxartian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Central Asia. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to arid environments, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
