    "intro": "Erica petiveri var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This species is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable conditions."
