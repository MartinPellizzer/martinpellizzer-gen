    "intro": "Euphorbia fendleri var. triligulata, commonly known as the Arizona devil\u2019s backbone, is a succulent shrub native to the Sonoran Desert. It features distinctive, ribbed stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves to survive in hot, dry conditions. This species is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
