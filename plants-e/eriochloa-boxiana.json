It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bright red to orange bracts that give it its common name. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, grass-like leaves with a slight waxy coating. Eriochloa boxiana is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking floral displays and drought tolerance."
