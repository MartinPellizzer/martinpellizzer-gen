    "intro": "Eria eriopsidobulbon, commonly known as the bulbous eria, is a unique orchid species characterized by its distinctive bulb-like structure. This plant exhibits a sympodial growth habit, with each pseudobulb capable of producing multiple leaves and flower spikes. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soil."
