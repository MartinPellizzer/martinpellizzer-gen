    "intro": "Eria borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Eria borneensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
