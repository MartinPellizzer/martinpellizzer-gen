    "intro": "Euphorbia meenae, commonly known as the Meena's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and features fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Euphorbia meenae is also noted for its ability to store water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments."
