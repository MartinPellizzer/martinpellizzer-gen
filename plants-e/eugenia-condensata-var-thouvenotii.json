    "intro": "Eugenia condensata var. thouvenotii, commonly known as the red gum or red myrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, dark purple to black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and woodland areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
