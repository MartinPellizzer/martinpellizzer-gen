    "intro": "Eriosema flaviflorum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered eriosema, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a stout, hairy stem that often branches near the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are alternate and trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that give it a distinctive texture. Eriosema flaviflorum is typically found in grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
