    "intro": "Epidendrum fragrans var. alticallum, commonly known as the fragrant epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a yellow lip. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its specific care requirements."
