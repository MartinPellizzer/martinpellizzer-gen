    "intro": "Euonymus koopmannii, commonly known as the Koopmann\u2019s spurge, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and seasonal color changes."
