    "intro": "Elatostema fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping elatostema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive white to pale green coloration. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Elatostema fruticosum is noted for its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats over time."
