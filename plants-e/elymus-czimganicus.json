    "intro": "Elymus czimganicus, commonly known as the Czimgan's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy blades that are typically less than 30 cm in height. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are arranged in panicles, and is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. The species is also of interest for its potential in forage and conservation efforts."
