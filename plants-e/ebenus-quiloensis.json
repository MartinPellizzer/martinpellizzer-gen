It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.
