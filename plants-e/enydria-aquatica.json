    "intro": "Enydria aquatica, commonly known as the water lily of the marshes, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland environments. It features broad, floating leaves that provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with showy petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize shallow water areas. Enydria aquatica plays an important role in water filtration and ecosystem stability in its native habitats."
