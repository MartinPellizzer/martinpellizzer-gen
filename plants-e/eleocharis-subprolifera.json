    "intro": "Eleocharis subprolifera, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Eleocharis subprolifera plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
