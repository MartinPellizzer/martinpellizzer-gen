    "intro": "Eriospermum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf eriosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features basal leaves that are broad and often hairy, with a distinctive rosette growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open when mature. Eriospermum latifolium is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
