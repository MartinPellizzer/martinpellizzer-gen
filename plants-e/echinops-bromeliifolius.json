    "intro": "Echinops bromeliifolius, commonly known as the bromelioid echinops, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces tall, spiky flower stalks that bear small, yellowish flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its unique appearance and ability to store water in its leaves make it well adapted to arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
