    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ciliatum var. kegelii, commonly known as the Kegel's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the moist, shaded forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive ciliate margin. The plant typically grows in humid, well-drained soils and thrives in low-light conditions, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its small, spore-bearing sori are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
