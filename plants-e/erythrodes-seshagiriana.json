    "intro": "Erythrodes seshagiriana, commonly known as the Seshagiri's redwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive. Its unique botanical features make it a valuable subject for ecological and botanical research."
