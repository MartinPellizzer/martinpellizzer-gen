It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are distinctive and often used for identification. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
