    "intro": "Euphorbia kavirensis, commonly known as the Kavirondo spurge, is a succulent plant native to East Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically spine-tipped, serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia kavirensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged droughts."
