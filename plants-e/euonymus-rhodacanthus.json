    "intro": "Euonymus rhodacanthus, commonly known as the red-fruited woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by distinctive red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and striking fruit clusters. Euonymus rhodacanthus is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
