    "intro": "Erythrophysa aesculina, commonly known as the red-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more prominent in the autumn season. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange before falling. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The bark of Erythrophysa aesculina is smooth and gray, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree matures."
