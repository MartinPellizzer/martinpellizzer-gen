    "intro": "Epidendrum validum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. Epidendrum validum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
