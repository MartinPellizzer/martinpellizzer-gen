    "intro": "Eriogonum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
