    "intro": "Echinopsis ferox, commonly known as the deadly nightshade cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and nocturnal blooming habits. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which open at night to attract pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a challenging plant for cultivation."
