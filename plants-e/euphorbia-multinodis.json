    "intro": "Euphorbia multinodis, commonly known as the nodding spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with multiple branching points, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thickened stems, adapting to arid environments. Euphorbia multinodis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
