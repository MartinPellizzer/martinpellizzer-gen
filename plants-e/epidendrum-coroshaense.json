    "intro": "Epidendrum coroshaense, commonly known as the Corosha Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and elongated, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
