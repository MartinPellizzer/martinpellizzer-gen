    "intro": "Epidendrum schizoclinandrium, commonly known as the red-tipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red floral bracts that contrast with its green foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often blooming in late spring or early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
