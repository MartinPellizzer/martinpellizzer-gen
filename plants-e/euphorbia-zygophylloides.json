It features a short, thick stem with large, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green or yellowish-green. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
