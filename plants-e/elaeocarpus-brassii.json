It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers followed by distinctive, round, woody fruits that are often covered in a thick, sticky coating. Elaeocarpus brassii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and fruiting structures."
