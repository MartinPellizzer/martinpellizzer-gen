    "intro": "Echinolobium coronarium, commonly known as the crown fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a terminal umbel, which are followed by distinctive, spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
