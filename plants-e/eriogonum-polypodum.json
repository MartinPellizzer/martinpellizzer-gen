    "intro": "Eriogonum polypodum, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. Eriogonum polypodum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
