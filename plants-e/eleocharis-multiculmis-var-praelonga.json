    "intro": "Eleocharis multiculmis var. praelonga, commonly known as the long-stemmed spike-rush, is a grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is distinguished by its elongated stem compared to the typical form of Eleocharis multiculmis."
