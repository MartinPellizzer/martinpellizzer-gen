    "intro": "Ericoides nanum, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with high salt exposure and strong winds. The plant features compact, leathery leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stems. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically pink or red, appearing in late spring to early summer. Ericoides nanum is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
