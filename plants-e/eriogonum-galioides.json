    "intro": "Eriogonum galioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum galioides plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
