    "intro": "Erigeron paludicola, commonly known as marsh fleabane, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disk florets. It blooms from late summer into early fall, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Erigeron paludicola is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
