    "intro": "Euphorbia breviarticulata var. trunciformis, commonly known as the truncated euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with paired, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a unique, modified leaf-like structure called a cyathium. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. This variety is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and distinctive appearance."
