    "intro": "Eryngium constancei, commonly known as the Constance's thistle, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant features spiky, blue to purple bracts that surround its central flower, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eryngium constancei is considered a vulnerable species."
