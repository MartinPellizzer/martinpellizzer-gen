    "intro": "Euphorbia bivonae var. intercedens, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in a thick layer of white, waxy sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
