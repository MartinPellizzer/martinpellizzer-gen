    "intro": "Euphorbia alluaudii subsp. alluaudii, commonly known as the \"Karoo euphorbia,\" is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching stem covered in dense, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
