    "intro": "Epicharis parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often attaching itself to other plants such as trees or shrubs. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a distinctive, often fragrant aroma. Epicharis parasitica is known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common sight in dense forest understories."
