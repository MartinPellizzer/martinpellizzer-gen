    "intro": "Eudema nubigena subsp. nubigena, commonly known as the cloudland eudema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, clustered white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky or loose soil. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in high-altitude conditions with limited sunlight."
