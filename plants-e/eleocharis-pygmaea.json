    "intro": "Eleocharis pygmaea, commonly known as the fairy grass or minute sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves and tiny, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are often inconspicuous and clustered in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
