    "intro": "Eupatorium kleinioides var. subglabratum, commonly known as the smoothleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
