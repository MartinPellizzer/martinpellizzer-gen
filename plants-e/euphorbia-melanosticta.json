    "intro": "Euphorbia melanosticta, commonly known as the black-spotted spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, waxy leaves that are typically green with dark spots. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
