    "intro": "Erodium malacoides subsp. chium, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found along the edges of dunes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread along coastal habitats."
