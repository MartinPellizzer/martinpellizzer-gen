    "intro": "Ephedranthus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered ephedranthus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in some African communities for various health purposes."
