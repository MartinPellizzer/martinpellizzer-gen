    "intro": "Escobariopsis prolifera subsp. texana, commonly known as the Texas scaly broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant is characterized by its dense, scaly, reddish-brown stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly Texas, and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
