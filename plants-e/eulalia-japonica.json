    "intro": "Eulalia japonica, commonly known as Japanese feather grass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It features slender, silver-gray blades with a feathery appearance, giving it a delicate, ornamental look. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. It is often used in landscaping for its elegant, wind-swaying foliage. Eulalia japonica is valued for its low maintenance and ability to create a soft, textural contrast in garden settings."
