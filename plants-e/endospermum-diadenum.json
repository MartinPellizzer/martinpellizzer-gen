    "intro": "Endospermum diadenum, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small evergreen tree native to Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. Its endosperm is a key component in the seed's development, providing nutrients for the emerging embryo. The ghost gum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
