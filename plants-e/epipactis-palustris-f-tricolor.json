It is characterized by its striking tricolored flowers, which typically display yellow, green, and brown hues. The plant has a terrestrial growth habit and features a basal rosette of leaves with a waxy coating. Its flowers are borne on a tall, leafless stem and are pollinated by specific insect species. This orchid is often found in peat bogs and other moist, acidic environments, where it thrives in the shade of forested areas."
