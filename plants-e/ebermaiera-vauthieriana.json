    "intro": "Ebermaiera vauthieriana, commonly known as the Vauthier's evergreen, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by red, fleshy berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
