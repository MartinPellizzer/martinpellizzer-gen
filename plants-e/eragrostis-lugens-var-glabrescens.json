    "intro": "Eragrostis lugens var. glabrescens, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a distinctive bluish hue, which contributes to its ornamental value. Silky bluegrass is also valued for its ability to form a dense turf and its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
