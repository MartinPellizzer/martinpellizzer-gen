It is characterized by its striking red-tipped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its foliage is often waxy and broad, adapting to the moist, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Epidendrum randii is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
