    "intro": "Euphorbia medicaginea var. arseniarensis, commonly known as the arsenic euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its stems and leaves. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
