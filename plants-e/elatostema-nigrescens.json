    "intro": "Elatostema nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed prostrate buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its stems are slender and can turn dark purple or black as they age, giving it its common name. Elatostema nigrescens is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
