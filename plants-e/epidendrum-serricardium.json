    "intro": "Epidendrum serricardium, commonly known as the serrated cardium epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum serricardium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
