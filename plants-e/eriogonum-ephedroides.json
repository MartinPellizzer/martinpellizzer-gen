    "intro": "Eriogonum ephedroides, commonly known as the ephedroid flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum ephedroides is often found in sagebrush communities and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
