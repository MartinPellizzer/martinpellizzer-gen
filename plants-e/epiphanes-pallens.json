    "intro": "Epiphanes pallens, commonly known as the pale epiphanes, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions and symbiotic relationships with fungi. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive pattern of veins, and it produces small, elliptical fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Epiphanes pallens is considered a threatened species in its native range."
