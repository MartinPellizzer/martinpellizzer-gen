    "intro": "Epidendrum tropinectarium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a striking contrast against its dark green foliage. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in warm, humid conditions with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
