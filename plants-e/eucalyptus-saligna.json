    "intro": "Eucalyptus saligna, commonly known as the river gum, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are often tinged with blue or gray. The tree produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its timber is valued for its strength and workability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. Eucalyptus saligna is also known for its medicinal properties, with its leaves used in traditional remedies and modern pharmaceuticals."
