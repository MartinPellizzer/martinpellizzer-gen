    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. macrostachyus, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for erosion control. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
