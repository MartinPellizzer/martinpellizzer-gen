    "intro": "Euphrasia alpina var. marianii, commonly known as the Alpine eyebright, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It has hairy, linear leaves and is often found in open, sunny habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to the typical Euphrasia alpina."
