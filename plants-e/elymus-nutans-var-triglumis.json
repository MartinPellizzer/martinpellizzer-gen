It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers that droop downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. It has fibrous roots and produces seed heads that are often used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
