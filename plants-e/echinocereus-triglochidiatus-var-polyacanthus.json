It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in the winter, typically around Christmas, hence its common name. The plant has a compact, branching structure with short, ribbed stems covered in spines. Its leaves are modified into spines, and the flowers come in a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
