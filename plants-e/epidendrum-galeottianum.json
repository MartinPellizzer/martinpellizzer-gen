    "intro": "Epidendrum galeottianum, commonly known as the Galeotti's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, arching stems with clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white to yellow in color. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum galeottianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
