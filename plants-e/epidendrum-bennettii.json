    "intro": "Epidendrum bennettii, commonly known as the Bennett's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum bennettii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
