    "intro": "Epilobium haenkeanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in moist, often shady environments such as stream banks and forest edges. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions. Epilobium haenkeanum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
