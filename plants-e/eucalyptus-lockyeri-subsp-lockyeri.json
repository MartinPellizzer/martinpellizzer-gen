    "intro": "Eucalyptus lockyeri subsp. lockyeri, commonly known as the Lockyer's mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery coating. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, clustered in umbels, and appear in late summer to early autumn. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators and shelter for various wildlife species."
