    "intro": "Echinopsis thionantha subsp. ferrarii, commonly known as the Ferrari's moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
