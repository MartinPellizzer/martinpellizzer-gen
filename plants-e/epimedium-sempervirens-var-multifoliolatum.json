    "intro": "Epimedium sempervirens var. multifoliolatum, commonly known as the Japanese barbatan, is a deciduous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features dense, evergreen foliage with large, leathery leaves that have a distinctive, multi-lobed appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on long, arching stems. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate shade and its attractive foliage throughout the growing season."
