    "intro": "Elymus dagestanicus, commonly known as the Dagestan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil quality. Elymus dagestanicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
