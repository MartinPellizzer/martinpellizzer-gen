    "intro": "Ephedra antisyphilitica var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed stems and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical capsules containing minute seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Due to its chemical composition, it has historically been used in traditional medicine, though its use is now regulated due to potential toxicity."
