The plant produces small, red, cherry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Eugenia neomyrtifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
