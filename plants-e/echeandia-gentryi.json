    "intro": "Echeandia gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Echeandia gentryi is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes other evening primroses and related species."
