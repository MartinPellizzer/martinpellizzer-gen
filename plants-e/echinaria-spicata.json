    "intro": "Echinaria spicata, commonly known as the spiny echinaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spiny heads, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Echinaria spicata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
