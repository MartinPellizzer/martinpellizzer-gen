    "intro": "Euphorbia bifurcata, commonly known as the Split-stemmed Spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive branching stem structure, with multiple stems emerging from the base, giving it a shrub-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia bifurcata is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
