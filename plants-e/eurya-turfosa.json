    "intro": "Eurya turfosa, commonly known as the broadleaf evergreen holly, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Eurya turfosa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ground cover in shaded or semi-shaded areas."
