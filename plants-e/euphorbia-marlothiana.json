    "intro": "Euphorbia marlothiana, commonly known as the Marloth's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a distinctive cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
