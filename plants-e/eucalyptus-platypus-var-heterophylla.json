    "intro": "Eucalyptus platypus var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Sydney peppermint, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled grey and green appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, though they can vary in shape depending on their position on the tree. This species is known for its aromatic, peppermint-scented leaves that release a strong fragrance when crushed. It thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and suburban areas."
