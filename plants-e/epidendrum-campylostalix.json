    "intro": "Epidendrum campylostalix, commonly known as the pink-veined epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinctive pink or red veins. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
