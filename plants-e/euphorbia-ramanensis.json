    "intro": "Euphorbia ramanensis, commonly known as the Raman's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the tropical regions of southern India. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
