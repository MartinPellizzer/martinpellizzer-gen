    "intro": "Echinopanax horridus, commonly known as the rough echinopanax, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several lobes and covered in a dense layer of stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
