    "intro": "Evelyna kermesina, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Evelyna kermesina is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
