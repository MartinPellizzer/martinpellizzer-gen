    "intro": "Eucalyptus pauciflora, commonly known as the snow gum, is a hardy evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high altitudes and alpine conditions. Eucalyptus pauciflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in horticulture for its resilience and aesthetic qualities."
