    "intro": "Eupatorium longifolium, commonly known as boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features tall, branched stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. These flowers are arranged in panicles and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Boneset is often found in moist habitats like wet meadows and stream banks."
