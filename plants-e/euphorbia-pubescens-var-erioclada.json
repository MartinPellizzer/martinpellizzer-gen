    "intro": "Euphorbia pubescens var. erioclada, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to rocky and sandy habitats. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a low-maintenance ornamental plant."
