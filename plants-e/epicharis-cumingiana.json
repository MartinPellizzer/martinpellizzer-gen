    "intro": "Epicharis cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's epiphytic orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Epicharis cumingiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
