    "intro": "Embadium uncinatum, commonly known as the hooked embadium, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Its unique hooked shape of the flower lip is a distinguishing feature. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
