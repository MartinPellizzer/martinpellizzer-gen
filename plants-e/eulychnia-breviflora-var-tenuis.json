    "intro": "Eulychnia breviflora var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender-flowered sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in Mediterranean and coastal climates."
