    "intro": "Epidendrum capitatum, commonly known as the Crowned Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum capitatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
