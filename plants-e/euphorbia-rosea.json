    "intro": "Euphorbia rosea, commonly known as the rose-spurred euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, branching stems covered in short, spiny hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by pinkish bracts that resemble rose petals. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
