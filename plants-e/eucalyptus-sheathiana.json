    "intro": "Eucalyptus sheathiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringy gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus sheathiana is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Its aromatic oils have been used in traditional medicine and for their antimicrobial properties."
