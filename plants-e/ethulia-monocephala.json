    "intro": "Ethulia monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, solitary flower that emerges from a single stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the flower features a distinctive, intricate structure with a lip that is often brightly colored. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ethulia monocephala is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range."
