    "intro": "Ecbolium hookerianum, commonly known as the Hooker's ecbolium, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
