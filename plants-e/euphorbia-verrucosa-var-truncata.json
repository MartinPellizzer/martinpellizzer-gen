    "intro": "Euphorbia verrucosa var. truncata, commonly known as the Truncated Spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a waxy, pale green or grayish coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
