    "intro": "Exochaenium hockii, commonly known as the Hock's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and has a low water requirement, making it drought-tolerant. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
