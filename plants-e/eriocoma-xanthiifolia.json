    "intro": "Eriocoma xanthiifolia, commonly known as the yellow-leaved eriocoma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in specialized habitats and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
