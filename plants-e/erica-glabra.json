    "intro": "Erica glabra, commonly known as the Heath, is a low-growing shrub native to western Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. Erica glabra is well adapted to harsh conditions, including coastal exposure and poor soil, making it a resilient species. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
