    "intro": "Echium humile subsp. caespitosum, commonly known as the dwarf thimbleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
