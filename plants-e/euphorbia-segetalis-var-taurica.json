It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. The plant features a stout, upright stem covered with small, greenish-yellow leaves. Its most distinctive feature is the production of unique, cup-shaped cyathia, which contain the small, yellowish flowers. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
