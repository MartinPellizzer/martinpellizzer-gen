    "intro": "Eutriana pilosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, hairy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and exotic plant collections. Eutriana pilosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
