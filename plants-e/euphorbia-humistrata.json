    "intro": "Euphorbia humistrata, commonly known as the coastal euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling form with pale green, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy species for coastal gardens. Euphorbia humistrata is also known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation."
