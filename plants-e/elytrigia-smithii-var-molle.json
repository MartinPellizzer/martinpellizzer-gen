    "intro": "Elytrigia smithii var. molle, commonly known as the soft brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in arid environments."
