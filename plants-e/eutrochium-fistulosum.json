    "intro": "Eutrochium fistulosum, commonly known as smooth blueweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eutrochium fistulosum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
