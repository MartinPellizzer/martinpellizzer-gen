    "intro": "Erodium subcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a small annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
