    "intro": "Erechtites agrestis, commonly known as common beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, hooked seeds that attach to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along trails. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
