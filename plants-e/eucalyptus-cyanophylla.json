    "intro": "Eucalyptus cyanophylla, commonly known as the blue-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, often forming dense thickets. Its flowers are small and white or pale blue, appearing in clusters during the spring. Eucalyptus cyanophylla is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
