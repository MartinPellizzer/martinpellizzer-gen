    "intro": "Erythea edulis, commonly known as the red-eyed treefrog, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red, orange, and yellow foliage, which serves as a form of aposematic warning to deter herbivores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Erythea edulis is also known for its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
