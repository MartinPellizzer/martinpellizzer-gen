    "intro": "Eriocaulon kengii, commonly known as the Keng's spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense mats near water bodies. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like clusters, and are pollinated by wind or insects."
