    "intro": "Ernodea gigantea, commonly known as the giant cluster bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, clustered pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small white or pink flowers. Ernodea gigantea is valued not only for its nutritional content but also for its role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
