    "intro": "Eutrema scapiflorum, commonly known as the searocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Eutrema scapiflorum is often found in dunes, rocky shores, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
