    "intro": "Elaphoglossum eximiiforme, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of its leaves. Elaphoglossum eximiiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
