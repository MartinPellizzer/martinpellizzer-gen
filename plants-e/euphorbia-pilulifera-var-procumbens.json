    "intro": "Euphorbia pilulifera var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
