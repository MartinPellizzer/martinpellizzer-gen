    "intro": "Euphorbia heteradena, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a caudex, which is a thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has spiny, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia heteradena is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
