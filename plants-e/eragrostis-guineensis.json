    "intro": "Eragrostis guineensis, commonly known as Guinea grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Guinea grass is often used for forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
