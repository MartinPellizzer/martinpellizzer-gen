    "intro": "Epidendrum calothyrsus, commonly known as the golden spike epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red markings. The plant typically thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that aids in water retention. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
