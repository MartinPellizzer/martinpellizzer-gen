It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and thrives in warm, humid environments. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
