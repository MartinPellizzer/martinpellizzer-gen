    "intro": "Elaphoglossum crispatum, commonly known as the curly holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a curled or crisped appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, and the spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters. Elaphoglossum crispatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
