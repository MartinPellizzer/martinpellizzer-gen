    "intro": "Eucalyptus calophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to coastal regions of southern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and dry conditions. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus calophylla is adapted to frequent fires, with lignotubers allowing it to resprout after disturbances."
