    "intro": "Euphorbia bisulcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Euphorbia bisulcata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
