It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale green, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in shaded environments. Erioglossum cuneifolium is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
