    "intro": "Erysimum longifolium proles collisparsum, commonly known as the coastal wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate, often covered in fine hairs, and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty coastal environments. It is valued for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize dunes. Its flowering period is typically short, lasting only a few weeks, making it a rare sight in the wild."
