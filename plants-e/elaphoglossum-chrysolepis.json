    "intro": "Elaphoglossum chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, golden-yellow pubescence. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a compact appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
