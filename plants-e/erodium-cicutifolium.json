    "intro": "Erodium cicutifolium, commonly known as common field eryngo, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and has finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the cow parsley. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a hard, pitted capsule, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Erodium cicutifolium is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
