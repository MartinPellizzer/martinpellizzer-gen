    "intro": "Eleocharis andesica, commonly known as the Andean spike rush, is a species of sedge native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous environments. Eleocharis andesica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to the extreme climate of its native range."
