    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. macrostachyum, commonly known as the tall field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are often more elongated in this form. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
