It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves and fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton. This plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, such as marshes and peatlands. Its morphology includes a low-growing habit with a dense root system that helps stabilize the soil. The species is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where it plays a role in wetland ecosystems."
