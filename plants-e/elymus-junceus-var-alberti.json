    "intro": "Elymus junceus var. alberti, commonly known as the Albert's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the primary reproductive structures in grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
