    "intro": "Elaphoglossum elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. Elaphoglossum elmeri is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
