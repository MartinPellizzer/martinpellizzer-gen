    "intro": "Ephedra gerardiana var. gerardiana, commonly known as the Tibetan ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is known for containing the alkaloid ephedrine, which has been used historically in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential for misuse, it is now regulated in many countries."
