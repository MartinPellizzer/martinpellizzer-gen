    "intro": "Elymus curvatiformis, commonly known as the bentgrass wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus curvatiformis is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
