    "intro": "Euphorbia gradyi, commonly known as the Grady's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several feet in height, often with a branching structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia gradyi is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
