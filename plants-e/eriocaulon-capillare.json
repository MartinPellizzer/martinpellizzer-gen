    "intro": "Eriocaulon capillare, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Eriocaulon capillare is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
