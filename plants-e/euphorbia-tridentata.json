    "intro": "Euphorbia tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with three prominent, tooth-like lobes at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically green and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Euphorbia tridentata is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
