It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its columnar stem and ribbed structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its unique features include small, spiny tubercles and a fissured appearance on the stem surface. Echinofossulocactus micracanthus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water."
