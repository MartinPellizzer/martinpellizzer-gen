    "intro": "Euclidium syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian Euclidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Syria. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at higher elevations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Euclidium syriacum is considered a vulnerable species."
