    "intro": "Eupatorium gracile var. odoratissimum, commonly known as the fragrant blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, preferring partial to full sun exposure. Its slender, branched stems are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The variety 'odoratissimum' is distinguished by its stronger, more aromatic fragrance compared to the typical variety."
