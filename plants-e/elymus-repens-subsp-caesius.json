    "intro": "Elymus repens subsp. caesius, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, silver-haired leaves and tufted inflorescences. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
