    "intro": "Eleocharis macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that contain small, white to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Eleocharis macrocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
