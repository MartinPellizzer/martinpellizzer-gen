    "intro": "Echinopsis plagiostoma, commonly known as the \"Moon Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stem. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of soil. Echinopsis plagiostoma is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
