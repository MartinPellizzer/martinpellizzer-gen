    "intro": "Elaphoglossum wawrae, commonly known as the Wawra's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant has small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae with serrated margins, and its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum wawrae thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it forms dense colonies. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for botanical gardens and humid indoor settings."
