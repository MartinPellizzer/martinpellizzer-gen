It features tiny, clustered pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, ovate leaves with a hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
