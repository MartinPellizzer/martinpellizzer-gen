    "intro": "Eversmannia, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Verbenaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Eversmannia is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
