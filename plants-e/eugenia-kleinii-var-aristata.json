It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
