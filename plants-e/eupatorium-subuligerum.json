It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, and it produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Eupatorium subuligerum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
