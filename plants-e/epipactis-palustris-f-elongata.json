    "intro": "Epipactis palustris f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated marsh helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves and a distinctive inflorescence of greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. Its pollination is primarily facilitated by specific insects, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
