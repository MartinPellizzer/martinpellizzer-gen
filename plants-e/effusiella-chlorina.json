    "intro": "Effusiella chlorina, commonly known as the green moss cushion, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, greenish-yellow cushions composed of closely packed thallus. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, leaf-like structure called a thallus. It is often found on rocky surfaces or in forest floors where humidity is high. Effusiella chlorina plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
