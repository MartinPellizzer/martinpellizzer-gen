    "intro": "Eryngium humile subvar. acaule, commonly known as the dwarf thistle or small sea holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, spiny foliage and small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches, with a rosette of basal leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are surrounded by a series of bracts that give it a distinctive, almost thistle-like appearance. This subvariety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
