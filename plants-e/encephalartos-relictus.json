    "intro": "Encephalartos relictus, commonly known as the relic cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and dense, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures. Its slow growth rate and limited geographic distribution make it highly vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of this unique botanical relic."
