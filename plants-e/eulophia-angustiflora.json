    "intro": "Eulophia angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eulophia, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Eulophia angustiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
