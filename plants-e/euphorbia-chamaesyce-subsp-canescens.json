    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaesyce subsp. canescens, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of the United States."
