    "intro": "Eirmocephala cainarachiensis, commonly known as the Cape Peninsula dandelion, is a small annual herb native to the western and southern Cape regions of South Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a short growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
