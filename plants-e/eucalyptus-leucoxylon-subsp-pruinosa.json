    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucoxylon subsp. pruinosa, commonly known as the white gum or white box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with a bluish-white underside, and are aromatic when crushed. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale yellow to cream in color. This subspecies is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
