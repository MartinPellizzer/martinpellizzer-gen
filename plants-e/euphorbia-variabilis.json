    "intro": "Euphorbia variabilis, commonly known as the variable spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that can vary in shape and color depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia variabilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is noted for its ability to tolerate a range of light conditions, making it adaptable to various habitats."
