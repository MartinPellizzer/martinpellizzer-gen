    "intro": "Ebertia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered ebertia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. The plant features slender, branched stems and finely dissected leaves that contribute to its ornamental value. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like arrangements, typical of the carrot family. Ebertia pauciflora is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
