    "intro": "Ericoila chirayita, commonly known as the Himalayan heather, is a small evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant typically features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
