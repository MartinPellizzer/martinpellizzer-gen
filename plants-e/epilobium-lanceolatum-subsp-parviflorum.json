    "intro": "Epilobium lanceolatum subsp. parviflorum, commonly known as narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, usually pink or red in color. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flowers and narrower leaves compared to other members of the Epilobium genus."
