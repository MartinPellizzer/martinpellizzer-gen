    "intro": "Epimedium multifoliolatum, commonly known as the bishop's hat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and early bloom. Epimedium multifoliolatum is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
