    "intro": "Euphorbia altissima var. altissima, commonly known as the tall spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, covered with smooth, waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Due to its milky sap, it is considered slightly toxic and should be handled with care."
