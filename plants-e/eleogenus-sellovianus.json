    "intro": "Eleogenus sellovianus, commonly known as the Sellovian sandalwood, is a rare and endangered tree species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often reaching over 100 years. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing smooth, kidney-shaped seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a glossy appearance. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
