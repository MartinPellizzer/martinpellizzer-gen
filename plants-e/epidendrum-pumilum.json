    "intro": "Epidendrum pumilum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Epidendrum pumilum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
