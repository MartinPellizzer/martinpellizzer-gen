    "intro": "Euphorbia sieboldiana f. sylvatica, commonly known as the forest euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Japan. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Its ability to store water makes it drought-tolerant once established."
