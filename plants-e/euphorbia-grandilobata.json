    "intro": "Euphorbia grandilobata, commonly known as the giant leaf euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length. The plant produces a unique cyathium, a cup-like structure that contains small yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
