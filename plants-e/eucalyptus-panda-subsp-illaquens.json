It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears iron-barked, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically grey-green in color. The flowers are small and white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. This subspecies is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
