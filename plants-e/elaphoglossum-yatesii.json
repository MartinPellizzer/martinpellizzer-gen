    "intro": "Elaphoglossum yatesii, commonly known as the Yates' holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Elaphoglossum yatesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
