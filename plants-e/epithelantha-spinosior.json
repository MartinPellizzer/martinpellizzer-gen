    "intro": "Epithelantha spinosior, commonly known as the spiny ghostplant, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in North America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring, which are often hidden among the spines. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
