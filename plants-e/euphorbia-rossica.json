    "intro": "Euphorbia rossica, commonly known as Russian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region. It features a short, woody stem with a distinctive crown of yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a glandular, sticky substance. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic and should be handled with care."
