    "intro": "Equisetum debile var. caespitosum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the genus Equisetum. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety is typically found in moist, acidic soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of ancient plant species. Its simple morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of plant evolution."
