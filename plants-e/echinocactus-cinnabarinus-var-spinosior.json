It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in prominent, reddish-brown spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its striking appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor collections."
