    "intro": "Euphorbia latazi, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age, often branching out into a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, slightly hairy texture. Euphorbia latazi is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats."
