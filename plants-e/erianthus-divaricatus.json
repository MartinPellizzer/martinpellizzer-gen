It typically grows in wetland areas and is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and cylindrical inflorescence. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability to fluctuating water levels. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscape design in moist environments."
