It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Echites bogotensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
