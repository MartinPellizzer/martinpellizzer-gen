    "intro": "Eulophia ochobiensis, commonly known as the Ochobiense orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Central Africa. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
