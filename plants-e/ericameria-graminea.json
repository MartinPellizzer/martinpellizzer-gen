    "intro": "Ericameria graminea, commonly known as yellow rabbitbrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across dry landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Ericameria graminea plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
