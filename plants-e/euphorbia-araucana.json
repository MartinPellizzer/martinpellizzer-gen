    "intro": "Euphorbia araucana, commonly known as the Andean spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
