It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that are covered in stiff, rigid hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Eupatorium rigidulum is typically found in moist habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodlands."
