    "intro": "Epicranthes jimcootesii, commonly known as the Jimcootes' cranesbill, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
