It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a cluster of spiny, globular flowers that bloom at night. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and they emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. This species is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of care."
