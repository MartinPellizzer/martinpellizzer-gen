    "intro": "Ephedra pentandra, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on different plants. Ephedra pentandra contains the alkaloid ephedrine, which has been used in traditional medicine. However, it is now classified as a controlled substance in many countries due to its potential for abuse and health risks."
