    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. dumosum, commonly known as the bushy buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
