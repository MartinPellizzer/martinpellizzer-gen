    "intro": "Eremophila subfloccosa subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular eremophila, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves with a glandular surface, which helps in reducing water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for dry climates."
