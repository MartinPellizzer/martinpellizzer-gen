    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. pilosum, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and also bear a hairy texture, contributing to its overall appearance. Hairy bedstraw is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
