    "intro": "Eucalyptus stricklandii, commonly known as the Strickland's malleable, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pink flowers, typically in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits to release seeds, and it is adapted to dry, sandy soils. Eucalyptus stricklandii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
