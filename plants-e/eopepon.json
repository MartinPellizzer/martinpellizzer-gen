    "intro": "Eopepon, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Eopepon typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle."
