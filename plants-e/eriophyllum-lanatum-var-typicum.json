    "intro": "Eriophyllum lanatum var. typicum, commonly known as the Woolly Sunflower, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. It has a low-growing habit with multiple stems and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The variety typicum is distinguished by its more robust growth and denser foliage compared to other varieties."
