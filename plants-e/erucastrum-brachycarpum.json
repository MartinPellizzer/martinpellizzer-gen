    "intro": "Erucastrum brachycarpum, commonly known as the narrow-seeded erucaceous, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, erect growth habit and features simple, alternate leaves that are typically linear to oblanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by siliques containing numerous small, rounded seeds. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
