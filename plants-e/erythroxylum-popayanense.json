    "intro": "Erythroxylum popayanense, commonly known as the Popay\u00e1n coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is notable for its chemical composition, which includes alkaloids similar to those found in other coca species. Due to its potential for cultivation and traditional use, it holds significance in both botanical and ethnobotanical studies."
