    "intro": "Erysimum czetzianum, commonly known as the Czetkiewicz's wallflower, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erysimum czetzianum is often found in rocky or sandy soils along mountain slopes and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
