    "intro": "Erica pubescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Erica pubescens var. pubescens is often used in rock gardens and as a coastal ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
