    "intro": "Enneapogon scaber, commonly known as the rough beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy texture and tall, erect growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, scabrous surface, giving it its common name. Enneapogon scaber is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh, dry conditions."
