    "intro": "Epipactis atropurpurea subvar. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves and produces showy, violet to greenish-purple flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The subvariety virescens is distinguished by its lighter, more greenish flower color compared to the typical purple form."
