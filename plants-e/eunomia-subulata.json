    "intro": "Eunomia subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf eunomia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the carrot family. Eunomia subulata is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and taxonomic research."
