    "intro": "Exacum divaricatum subsp. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
