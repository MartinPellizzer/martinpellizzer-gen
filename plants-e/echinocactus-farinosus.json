It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in a layer of white, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It is a slow-growing succulent that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
