    "intro": "Emmotum fagifolium, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in mountainous areas, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features palmately compound leaves with three to five lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring and are followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
