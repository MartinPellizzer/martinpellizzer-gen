    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has small, delicate leaves and produces tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
