    "intro": "Euphorbia calyciflora, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive addition to gardens and landscapes."
