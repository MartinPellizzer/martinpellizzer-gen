    "intro": "Erythroxylum lenticellosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It produces a milky sap that contains psychoactive alkaloids, similar to those found in coca and other related species. Due to its chemical composition, it is of interest in both botanical and pharmacological research."
