    "intro": "Escobaria missouriensis subsp. navajoensis, commonly known as Navajo prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States. It features a low-growing, sprawling structure with spiny stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system to maximize water absorption. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its resilience in harsh desert conditions."
