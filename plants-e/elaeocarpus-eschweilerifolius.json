    "intro": "Elaeocarpus eschweilerifolius, commonly known as the Eschweilera, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and has limited economic use due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements."
