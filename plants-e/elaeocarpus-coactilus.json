    "intro": "Elaeocarpus coactilus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
