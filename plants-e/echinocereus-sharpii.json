    "intro": "Echinocereus sharpii, commonly known as the Sharpii cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
