    "intro": "Echinocactus horizonthalonius var. laticostatus, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 30 inches in height. The plant features prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white to yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-resistant. The varietal form, laticostatus, is distinguished by its broader, more pronounced ribs compared to the typical variety."
