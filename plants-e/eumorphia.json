    "intro": "Eumorphia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. The plant's roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter. Eumorphia is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found growing on the bark of trees in wet, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
