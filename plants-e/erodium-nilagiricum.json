    "intro": "Erodium nilagiricum, commonly known as Nilagiri stormweed, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Western Ghats in India. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
