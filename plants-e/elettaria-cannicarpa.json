    "intro": "Elettaria cannicarpa, commonly known as wild cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, clustered inflorescences and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark, triangular berries containing aromatic seeds. These seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cardamom. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both horticultural and commercial purposes."
