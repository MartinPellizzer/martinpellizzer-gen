    "intro": "Epidendrum capartianum, commonly known as the Capartian orchid, is a species native to Central America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Epidendrum capartianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
