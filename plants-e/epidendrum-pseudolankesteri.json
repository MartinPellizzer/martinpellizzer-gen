    "intro": "Epidendrum pseudolankesteri, commonly known as the Mexican flame orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico. It features long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of vibrant red and orange flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum pseudolankesteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is a popular choice for both garden cultivation and botanical collections."
