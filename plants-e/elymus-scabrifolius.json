    "intro": "Elymus scabrifolius, commonly known as roughleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its coarse, serrated leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike with spikelets that are often loosely arranged. Elymus scabrifolius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
