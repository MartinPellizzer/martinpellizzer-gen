    "intro": "Eriosorus biardii, commonly known as the golden fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright yellow fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Eriosorus biardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
