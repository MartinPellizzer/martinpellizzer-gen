    "intro": "Euphorbia macrocarpa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems and produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, which are actually modified inflorescences called cyathia. The plant has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Euphorbia macrocarpa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments."
