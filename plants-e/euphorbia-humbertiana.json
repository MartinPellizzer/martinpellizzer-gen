    "intro": "Euphorbia humbertiana, commonly known as the Humbert's spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a distinctive branching pattern and is often found in rocky or arid environments. It contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia humbertiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance."
