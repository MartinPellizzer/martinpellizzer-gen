    "intro": "Eucalyptus porrecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree form, with rough, fissured bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a greyish-green color and a prominent midrib. Its flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters, and are pollinated by insects. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
