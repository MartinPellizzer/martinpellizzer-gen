    "intro": "Euphorbia damasoi, commonly known as the Damasoi spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, thick stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia damasoi is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
