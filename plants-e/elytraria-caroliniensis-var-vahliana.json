    "intro": "Elytraria caroliniensis var. vahliana, commonly known as the Carolina marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in moist environments. It is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
