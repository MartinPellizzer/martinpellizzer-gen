    "intro": "Euphorbia pulchella, commonly known as the yellow spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that features a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to wetland environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Euphorbia pulchella is notable for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
