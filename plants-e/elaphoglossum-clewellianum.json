    "intro": "Elaphoglossum clewellianum, commonly known as the Clewell's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant is native to the forests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions such as Malaysia and Indonesia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a linear pattern."
