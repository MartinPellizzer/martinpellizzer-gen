    "intro": "Euphorbia pubiglans, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, pubescent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. Euphorbia pubiglans is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
