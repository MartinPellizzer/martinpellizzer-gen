    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 virgata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a hybrid species native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in thin, fibrous strips, revealing a mottled pattern of grey and green. Eucalyptus \u00d7 virgata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
