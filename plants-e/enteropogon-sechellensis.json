It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a fruit that is botanically classified as a syncarp, formed from the fusion of multiple berries. The fruit's outer husk is fibrous, while the inner part contains edible starchy pulp. It plays a significant role in both ecological systems and human agriculture in its native habitats."
