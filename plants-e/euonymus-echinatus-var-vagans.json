It features dense, glossy dark green foliage with small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Its varietal form, var. vagans, is distinguished by its more spreading growth habit compared to the typical species."
