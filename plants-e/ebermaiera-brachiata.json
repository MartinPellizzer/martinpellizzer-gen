It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a branched pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in inflorescences, and it produces fruit that is edible for some bird species. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
