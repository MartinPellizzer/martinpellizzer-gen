    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine f. brevibracteata, commonly known as the short-bracted helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This orchid is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
