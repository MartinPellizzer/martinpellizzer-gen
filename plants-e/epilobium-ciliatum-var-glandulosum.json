    "intro": "Epilobium ciliatum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with finely toothed margins. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spike-like clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its glandular hairs, which give it a distinct appearance and aid in its identification."
