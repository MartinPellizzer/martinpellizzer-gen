    "intro": "Espeletia discoidea var. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed espeletia, is a unique plant species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure and dense, woolly foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in the harsh conditions of cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in a striking violet or purple hue. This variety is notable for its resilience and adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of its native habitat."
