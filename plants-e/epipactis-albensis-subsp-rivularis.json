    "intro": "Epipactis albensis subsp. rivularis, commonly known as the river marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland and riparian habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, yellow-green flower with a distinctive, hairy lip. The plant is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and often grows in association with other wetland flora. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological specificity and conservation status."
