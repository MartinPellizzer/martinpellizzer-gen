    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. chlorothamnus, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically gray-green, hairy, and arranged in a compact rosette, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, spherical seed pods that contain numerous seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. This variety is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats."
