    "intro": "Euphorbia serpicula, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features succulent, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are specialized structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly serrated, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Euphorbia serpicula is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
