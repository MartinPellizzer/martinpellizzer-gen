    "intro": "Euphorbia petaloidea var. nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that are often adorned with spines. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually small, oval, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
