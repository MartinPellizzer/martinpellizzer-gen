    "intro": "Eriachne humilis, commonly known as the dwarf spinifex, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small organisms. Eriachne humilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native gardens."
