It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to other varieties of Elytraria caroliniensis."
