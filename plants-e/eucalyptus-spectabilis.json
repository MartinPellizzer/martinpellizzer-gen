    "intro": "Eucalyptus spectabilis, commonly known as the silver dollar tree, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a silver-white underneath, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a grey-green color and a rough texture. Eucalyptus spectabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
