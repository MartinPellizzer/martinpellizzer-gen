    "intro": "Eucalyptus bosistoana, commonly known as the Bosisto's gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, serrated texture. This species is typically found in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal or near-coastal environments."
