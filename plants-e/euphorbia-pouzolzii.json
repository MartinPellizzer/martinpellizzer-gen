    "intro": "Euphorbia pouzolzii, commonly known as the Lesotho spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and produces a unique, yellowish-green sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It has small, clustered leaves and produces cyathium flowers, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
