    "intro": "Erythrodes oreadum, commonly known as the mountain rose, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
