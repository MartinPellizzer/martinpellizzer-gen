    "intro": "Euphorbia helioscopia proles helioscopioides, commonly known as the sun spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its yellowish-green sap and small, inconspicuous flowers. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a waxy coating and produces clusters of cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its milky sap, it is considered toxic and should be handled with care."
