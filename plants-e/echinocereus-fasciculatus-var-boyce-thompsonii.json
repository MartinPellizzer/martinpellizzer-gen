    "intro": "Echinocereus fasciculatus var. boyce-thompsonii, commonly known as the Boyce-Thompson prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, a spherical, fleshy berry, is edible and often used in local cuisines. This species is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system and spiny stems that help reduce water loss."
