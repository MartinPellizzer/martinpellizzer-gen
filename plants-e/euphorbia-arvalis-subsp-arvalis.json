    "intro": "Euphorbia arvalis subsp. arvalis, commonly known as the field spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. The plant features a basal rosette of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowering stems produce clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
