    "intro": "Eurotia fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, erect stems and clusters of pink to lavender flowers. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Eurotia fruticulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
