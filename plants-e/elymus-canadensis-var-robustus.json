    "intro": "Elymus canadensis var. robustus, commonly known as Canada wildrye, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue-green in color. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
