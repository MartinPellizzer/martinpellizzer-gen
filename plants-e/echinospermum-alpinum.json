    "intro": "Echinospermum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine echinosperm, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and daisy-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Echinospermum alpinum is also notable for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in South American herbal remedies."
