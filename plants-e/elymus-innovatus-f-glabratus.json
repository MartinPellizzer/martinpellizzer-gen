    "intro": "Elymus innovatus f. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a variant of the species Elymus innovatus. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields, preferring well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. This form is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other forms of the species."
