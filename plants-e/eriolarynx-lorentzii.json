It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
