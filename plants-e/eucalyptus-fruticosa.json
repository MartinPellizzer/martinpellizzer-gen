It is characterized by its aromatic, rough bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment. Eucalyptus fruticosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to attract native wildlife."
