    "intro": "Endostemon albus, commonly known as the white endostemon, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
