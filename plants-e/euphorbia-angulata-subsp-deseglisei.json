    "intro": "Euphorbia angulata subsp. deseglisei, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features distinctive, angular, and often spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
