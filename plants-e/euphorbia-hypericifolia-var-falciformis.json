    "intro": "Euphorbia hypericifolia var. falciformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to rocky and sandy soils. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
