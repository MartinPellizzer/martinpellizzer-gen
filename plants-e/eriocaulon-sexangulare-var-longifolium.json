    "intro": "Eriocaulon sexangulare var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often longer than they are wide. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in areas with consistent moisture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tips of its stems. This variant is distinguished by its elongated foliage, which sets it apart from other members of the Eriocaulon genus."
