    "intro": "Eurybia xerophila, commonly known as the dryland goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, featuring a deep root system and silver-gray foliage to reduce water loss. It produces yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eurybia xerophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
