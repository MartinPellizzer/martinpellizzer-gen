    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus subsp. mojavensis, commonly known as the Mojave prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of spiny, paddle-shaped stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are edible, though they are typically consumed when fully ripe. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and reducing water loss through its spines."
