    "intro": "Epigeneium arunachalense, commonly known as the Arunachal epigeneium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of India. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and clustered, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats at high altitudes. Its botanical features include a short, thick rhizome and waxy, dark green foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
