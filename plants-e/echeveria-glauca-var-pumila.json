    "intro": "Echeveria glauca var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf blue echeveria, is a compact succulent with rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves. It originates from arid regions of Mexico and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and striking color make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
