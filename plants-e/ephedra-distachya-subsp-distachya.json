    "intro": "Ephedra distachya subsp. distachya, commonly known as the desert tea, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. Its stems contain ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine. This species is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
