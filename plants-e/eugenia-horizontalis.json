    "intro": "Eugenia horizontalis, commonly known as the silverleaf eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, round, woody capsules that contain the plant's seeds. Eugenia horizontalis is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
