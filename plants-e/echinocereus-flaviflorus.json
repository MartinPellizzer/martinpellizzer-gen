    "intro": "Echinocereus flaviflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and bats. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for arid environments."
