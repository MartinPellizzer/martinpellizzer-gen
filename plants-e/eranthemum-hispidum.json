It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
