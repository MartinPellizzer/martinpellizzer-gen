    "intro": "Euploca cupressina, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often along the shoreline. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and the plant is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Euploca cupressina is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
