    "intro": "Erica carnea var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and cool, moist summers. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that provide year-round interest. This variety is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
