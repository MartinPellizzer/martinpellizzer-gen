    "intro": "Eleutheranthera ruderalis var. ruderalis, commonly known as the rough marsh plant, is a flowering plant native to wetland and disturbed areas in North America. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
