    "intro": "Euphorbia niqueroana, commonly known as the Niqueroan spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
