    "intro": "Eurya nervosa, commonly known as the glossy evergreen holly, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are glossy and have a prominent venation pattern. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Eurya nervosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
