    "intro": "Euphorbia serrata var. subacaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with smooth, green stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a serrated edge, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
