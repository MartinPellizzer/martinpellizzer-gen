    "intro": "Eleocharis ovata var. engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, brownish seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
