    "intro": "Euphorbia godana, commonly known as the Sudanese spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia godana is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. It is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
