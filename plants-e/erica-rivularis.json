    "intro": "Erica rivularis, commonly known as the river heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces delicate pink or white flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Erica rivularis is adapted to saline and windy environments, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for landscaping in maritime climates."
