    "intro": "Erythrodes cornejoi, commonly known as the Corsican redwood, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Mediterranean region. It is a woody shrub characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to rocky and arid environments, showcasing thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptations. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
