    "intro": "Elaphoglossum leucolepis subsp. leucolepis, commonly known as the silver-stemmed holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of silvery scales. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous short, upright shoots. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, translucent indusium."
