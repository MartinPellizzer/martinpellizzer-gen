It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Elaphoglossum gracile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
