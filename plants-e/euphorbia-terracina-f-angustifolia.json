    "intro": "Euphorbia terracina f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions. Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it is considered a potential weed in some areas."
