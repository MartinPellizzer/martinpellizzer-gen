    "intro": "Euphorbia obovalifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
