    "intro": "Eriogonum eremicola, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, globular clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas. It has silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum eremicola is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
