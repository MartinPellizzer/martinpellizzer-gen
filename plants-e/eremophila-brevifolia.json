    "intro": "Eremophila brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a small shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is also drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. Eremophila brevifolia is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and birds."
