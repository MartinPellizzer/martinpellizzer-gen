    "intro": "Epidendrum vulcanicum, commonly known as the Flame Orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the volcanic regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange, often with a yellow throat. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Epidendrum vulcanicum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
