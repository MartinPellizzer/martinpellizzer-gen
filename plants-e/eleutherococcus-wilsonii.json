    "intro": "Eleutherococcus wilsonii, commonly known as Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a sharp, acidic taste. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties. Eleutherococcus wilsonii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
