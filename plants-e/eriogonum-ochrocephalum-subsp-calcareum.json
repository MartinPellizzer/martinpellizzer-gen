    "intro": "Eriogonum ochrocephalum subsp. calcareum, commonly known as the caliche milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils."
