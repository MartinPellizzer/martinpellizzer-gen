    "intro": "Euphrasia pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf eyebright, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. Euphrasia pinifolia is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
