    "intro": "Ectrosia spadicea, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the leaves. Ectrosia spadicea thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening in suitable climates."
