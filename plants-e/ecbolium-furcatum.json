    "intro": "Ecbolium furcatum, commonly known as the forked ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its legume-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive forked shape at the base, contributing to its unique appearance. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ecbolium furcatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
