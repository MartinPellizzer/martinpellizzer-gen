    "intro": "Euphrasia praecox, commonly known as early euphrasia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, which is why it is called \"early.\" Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Euphrasia praecox is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
