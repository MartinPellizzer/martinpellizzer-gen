It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and along the edges of lakes. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and a striking display of white to pale pink flowers in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and are characterized by their showy, spurred petals. Epilobium latifolium var. albiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
