    "intro": "Euphorbia schizoclada, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested or contacted with skin. Euphorbia schizoclada is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
