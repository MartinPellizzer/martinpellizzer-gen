    "intro": "Epipactis clausa, commonly known as the closed helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a unique inflorescence that bears pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is often folded or rolled, a feature common in many orchid species. Epipactis clausa is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with mosses and other shade-tolerant flora."
