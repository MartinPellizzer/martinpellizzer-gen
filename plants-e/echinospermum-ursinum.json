    "intro": "Echinospermum ursinum, commonly known as the bear's milk plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that contain seeds with a tuft of hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Echinospermum ursinum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
