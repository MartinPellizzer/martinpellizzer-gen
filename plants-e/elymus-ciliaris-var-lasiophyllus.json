It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
