    "intro": "Eremopyrum olgae, commonly known as the desert grass or sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eremopyrum olgae is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage. Its ecological role includes stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert fauna."
