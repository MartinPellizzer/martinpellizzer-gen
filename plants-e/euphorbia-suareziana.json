    "intro": "Euphorbia suareziana, commonly known as the Suarez's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia suareziana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to dry environments."
