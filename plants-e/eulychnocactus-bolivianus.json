    "intro": "Eulychnocactus bolivianus, commonly known as the Bolivian nightshade cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Bolivia. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a short, cylindrical stem with clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. Its foliage consists of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it store water in arid environments. This cactus is adapted to thrive in high-altitude regions with limited rainfall."
