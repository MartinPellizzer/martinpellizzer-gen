    "intro": "Euphrasia salisburgensis subsp. corsica, commonly known as Corsican eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
