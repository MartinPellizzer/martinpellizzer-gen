    "intro": "Elaphoglossum clarenceanum, commonly known as the Clarenceanum holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Elaphoglossum clarenceanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
