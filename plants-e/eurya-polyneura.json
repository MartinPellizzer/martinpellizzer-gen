    "intro": "Eurya polyneura, commonly known as the smoothleaf eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Eurya polyneura is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
