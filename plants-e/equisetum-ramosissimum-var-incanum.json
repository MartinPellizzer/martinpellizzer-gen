    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. incanum, commonly known as the silver fir or slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in small, scale-like structures that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its ancient morphology reflects its status as one of the oldest groups of vascular plants."
