    "intro": "Echinopsis hossei, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain water in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
