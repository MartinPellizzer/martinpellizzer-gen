    "intro": "Eriocaulon dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's spikerush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist environments effectively. Eriocaulon dalzellii is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils."
