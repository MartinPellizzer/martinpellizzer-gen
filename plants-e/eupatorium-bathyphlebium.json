    "intro": "Eupatorium bathyphlebium, commonly known as the water boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers in the summer. Its common name reflects its preference for aquatic or wetland environments, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. Eupatorium bathyphlebium plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
