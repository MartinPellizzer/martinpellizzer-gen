    "intro": "Etorloba, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. Its flowers are large, showy, and typically pink or purple, blooming at dawn and closing at midday. The plant thrives in still, nutrient-rich waters and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Etorloba plays a significant role in the local ecosystems and has cultural importance among indigenous communities."
