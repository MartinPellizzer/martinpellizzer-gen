    "intro": "Eremophila reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined emu bush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its grey-green, narrow leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in winter. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for low-water gardens. Eremophila reticulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
