    "intro": "Eriosema tephrosioides, commonly known as the yellow eriosema, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Eriosema tephrosioides is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
