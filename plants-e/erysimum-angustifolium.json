It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Erysimum angustifolium is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
