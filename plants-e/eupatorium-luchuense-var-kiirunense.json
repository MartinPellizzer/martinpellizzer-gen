    "intro": "Eupatorium luchuense var. kiirunense, commonly known as the Kiirunese eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation within its native habitat. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, sharing features such as composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangements. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its region."
