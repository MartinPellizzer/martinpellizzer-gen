    "intro": "Eubrachion brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian starfish plant, is a unique species native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive star-like inflorescence. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
