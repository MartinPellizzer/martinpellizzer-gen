    "intro": "Eriogonum lateriflorum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Eriogonum lateriflorum is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
