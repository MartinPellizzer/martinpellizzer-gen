It is characterized by its unique cylindrical stem structure, which is often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is native to specific regions of South America and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
