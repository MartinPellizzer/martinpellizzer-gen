    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale var. comosum, commonly known as the coastal horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum litorale and Equisetum comosum. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, coastal environments, such as salt marshes and sandy shores. The plant features a slender, jointed stem covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches. It is adapted to tolerate high salinity and frequent tidal exposure, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas contribute to its ecological significance in stabilizing shorelines."
