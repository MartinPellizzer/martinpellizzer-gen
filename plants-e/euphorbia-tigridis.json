It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a notable addition to botanical collections."
