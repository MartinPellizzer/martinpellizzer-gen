    "intro": "Eleocharis submersa, commonly known as the submerged spike-rush, is a wetland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is an aquatic or semi-aquatic species that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often submerged, with small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Eleocharis submersa is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from water."
