    "intro": "Eruca cappadocica var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly cabbageweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to gray pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to that of mustard greens. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
