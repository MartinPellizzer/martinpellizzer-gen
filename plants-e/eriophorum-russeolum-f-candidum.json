    "intro": "Eriophorum russeolum f. candidum, commonly known as the white cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy white inflorescences that resemble cotton, which are produced by the plant's reduced, scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Its flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment. The white coloration of the inflorescence is due to the presence of fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance."
