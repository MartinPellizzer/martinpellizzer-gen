    "intro": "Eleocharis sagotii var. glochidiata, commonly known as the spiny spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, narrow leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, usually greenish or brownish flowers. The variety glochidiata is distinguished by the presence of spiny structures on the bracts, which can aid in seed dispersal."
