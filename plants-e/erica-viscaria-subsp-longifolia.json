It features dense, compact foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
