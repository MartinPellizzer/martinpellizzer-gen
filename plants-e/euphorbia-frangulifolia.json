    "intro": "Euphorbia frangulifolia, commonly known as the fragrant euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that help store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts, which serve to attract pollinators. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Euphorbia frangulifolia is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, thriving in dry climates."
