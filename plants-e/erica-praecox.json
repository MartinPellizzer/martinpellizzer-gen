    "intro": "Erica praecox, commonly known as early heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens. Erica praecox is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
