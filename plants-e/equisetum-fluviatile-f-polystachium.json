    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile f. polystachium, commonly known as the river horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety is typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of rivers. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it has a distinct appearance with its spore-bearing structures called strobila. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
