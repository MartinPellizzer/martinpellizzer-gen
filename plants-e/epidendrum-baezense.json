    "intro": "Epidendrum baezense, commonly known as the Baez's orchid, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in Honduras and Nicaragua. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are characterized by their vibrant colors, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Epidendrum baezense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
