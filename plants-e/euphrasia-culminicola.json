    "intro": "Euphrasia culminicola, commonly known as the mountain eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Euphrasia culminicola is often found in meadows and mountain slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
