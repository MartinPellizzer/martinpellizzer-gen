    "intro": "Euphorbia squamigera var. montgoi, commonly known as the Montgoi spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
