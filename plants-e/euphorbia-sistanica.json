    "intro": "Euphorbia sistanica, commonly known as the Sistan spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Iran. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-shaped inflorescence called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and has a low-growing habit. Euphorbia sistanica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
