    "intro": "Elaeocarpus euneurus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-barked trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are typically elliptical, with a glossy surface and a prominent midrib. Elaeocarpus euneurus is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving."
