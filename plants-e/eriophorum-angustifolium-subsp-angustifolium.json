    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils in tundra and boreal habitats. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic and alpine organisms."
