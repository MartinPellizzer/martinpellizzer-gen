    "intro": "Elynanthus ensifolius, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Elynanthus ensifolius plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
