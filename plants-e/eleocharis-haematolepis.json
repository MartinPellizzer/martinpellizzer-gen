    "intro": "Eleocharis haematolepis, commonly known as the bloodstem sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red or purple pigmentation in its stems, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. Eleocharis haematolepis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
