    "intro": "Erigeron pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at higher elevations. Its delicate white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to alpine meadows. Erigeron pyrenaicus is relatively small, usually reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, and is often found in association with other alpine flora."
