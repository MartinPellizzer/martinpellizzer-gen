    "intro": "Eucalyptus pachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a tall tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Eucalyptus pachycarpa is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
