    "intro": "Euxolus deflexus var. rufescens, commonly known as the red-barked euphorbia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, reddish-barked stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red, berry-like capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
