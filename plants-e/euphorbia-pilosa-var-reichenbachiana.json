    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa var. reichenbachiana, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, soft, white to grayish hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
