    "intro": "Eragrostis multiflora var. biformis, commonly known as the two-branched lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically two-branched, giving it its specific epithet. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing some drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
