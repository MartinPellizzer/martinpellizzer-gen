    "intro": "Erythronium grandiflorum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower dog's-tooth violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of nodding, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to the typical E. grandiflorum."
