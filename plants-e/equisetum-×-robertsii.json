It is a hybrid between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale, characterized by its spore-bearing cones and whorled leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its stems are segmented and jointed, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the tail of a horse, hence its common name. Equisetum \u00d7 robertsii is primarily used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
