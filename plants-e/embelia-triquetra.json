    "intro": "Embelia triquetra, commonly known as the three-cornered eggplant, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, triangular, fleshy fruits that resemble tiny eggs. The plant has opposite, oval leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is typically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
