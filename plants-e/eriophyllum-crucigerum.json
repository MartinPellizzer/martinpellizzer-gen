    "intro": "Eriophyllum crucigerum, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, yellowish-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, scale-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces numerous tiny flowers in late spring to early summer. Eriophyllum crucigerum is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
