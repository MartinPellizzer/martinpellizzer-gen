    "intro": "Epidendrum calanthum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum calanthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
