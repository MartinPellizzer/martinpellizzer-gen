It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant features smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for native pollinators and its adaptability to arid conditions."
