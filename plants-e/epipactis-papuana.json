    "intro": "Epipactis papuana, commonly known as the Papuan helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Papua and New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single or few spikes of greenish-yellow or white flowers. Epipactis papuana is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
