It is characterized by its striking red bark and evergreen foliage, which contribute to its unique appearance. The plant belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is known for its slow growth rate and longevity. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of precipitation. Due to habitat loss and deforestation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
