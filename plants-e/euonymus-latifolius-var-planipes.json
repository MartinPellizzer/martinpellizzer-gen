It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually 3\u20136 inches long and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, inflated seed capsules that split open to release seeds. Its foliage turns vibrant red or orange in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in gardens for its seasonal color and structural interest."
