It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
