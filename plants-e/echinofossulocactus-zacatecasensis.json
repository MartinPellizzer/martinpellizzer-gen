    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus zacatecasensis, commonly known as the Zacatecas hedge cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in thick, spiny ribs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
