    "intro": "Euphorbia aphylla, commonly known as the hairless spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having modified structures called phyllodes that perform photosynthesis. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia aphylla is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
