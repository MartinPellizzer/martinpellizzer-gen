    "intro": "Escobariopsis lasiacantha, commonly known as the hairy escobariopsis, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and a distinctive, pale yellow to orange thallus covered with fine, hairy structures. The lichen typically grows on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate and subtropical regions. Its morphology includes a lecanorine thallus with a well-developed medulla and a cortex that is often differentiated. Escobariopsis lasiacantha is a relatively rare species, and its conservation status is of interest to mycologists and lichenologists."
