    "intro": "Eugenia owariensis, commonly known as the Japanese huckleberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or purple in color, which are used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
