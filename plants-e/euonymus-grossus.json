    "intro": "Euonymus grossus, commonly known as the burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and striking red foliage that turns vibrant shades of orange and crimson in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that persist through winter. Its leaves are oval-shaped with smooth edges and a glossy texture. Euonymus grossus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
