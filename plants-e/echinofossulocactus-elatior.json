    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus elatior, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense, spiny ribs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
