    "intro": "Erysimum diffusum, commonly known as the spreading wallflower, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a low-growing habit with linear, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
