    "intro": "Eupatorium herbaceum, commonly known as boneset, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features upright, branching stems covered with fine hairs and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Its small, clustered white flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Boneset has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported fever-reducing properties."
