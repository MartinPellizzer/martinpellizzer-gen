    "intro": "Euodia altissima, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a small evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its spiny stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are used in herbal remedies for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. Euodia altissima is valued both for its ornamental appearance and its historical use in Chinese medicine."
