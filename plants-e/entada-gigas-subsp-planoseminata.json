It produces long, cylindrical pods that contain hard, angular seeds with distinctive horn-like projections. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its bark and seeds have been used in traditional medicine for various purposes. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more flattened seed shape compared to other Entada species."
