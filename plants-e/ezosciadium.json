    "intro": "Ezosciadium, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. Ezosciadium species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are not widely cultivated but are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
