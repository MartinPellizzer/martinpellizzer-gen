    "intro": "Echinopsis aurea subsp. dobeana, commonly known as the golden echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
