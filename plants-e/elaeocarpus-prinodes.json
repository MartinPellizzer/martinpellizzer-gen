It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
