    "intro": "Epilobium prostratum, commonly known as creeping willow or prostrate willow, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Epilobium prostratum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wet meadows."
