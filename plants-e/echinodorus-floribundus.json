It features broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, providing excellent coverage in freshwater aquariums. The plant thrives in moderate to high light conditions and requires regular fertilization to maintain its vibrant green color. It is known for its ability to oxygenate water and serve as a habitat for aquatic life. Echinodorus floribundus is also capable of producing small white flowers, though this is less common in aquarium settings."
