    "intro": "Euphorbia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
