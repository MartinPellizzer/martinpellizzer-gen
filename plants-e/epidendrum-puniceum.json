    "intro": "Epidendrum puniceum, commonly known as the red-flowered epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers, which are often adorned with contrasting yellow or green markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum puniceum is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
