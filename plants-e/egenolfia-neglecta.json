    "intro": "Egenolfia neglecta, commonly known as the neglected mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which are specialized structures that connect to the host's vascular system. It is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in shaded, forested environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
