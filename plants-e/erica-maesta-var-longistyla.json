    "intro": "Erica maesta var. longistyla, commonly known as the Giant Heath, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Corsica. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a unique addition to alpine gardens. Its foliage consists of leathery, dark green leaves that provide year-round visual interest. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
