    "intro": "Eriosyce ceratistes var. combarbalensis, commonly known as the Combarbal\u00e1 cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
