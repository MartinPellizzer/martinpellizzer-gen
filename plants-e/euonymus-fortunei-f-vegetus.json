    "intro": "Euonymus fortunei f. vegetus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is valued for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is often used in landscaping for ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
