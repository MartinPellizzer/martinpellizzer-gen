    "intro": "Eragrostis rotifer, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Eragrostis rotifer is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
