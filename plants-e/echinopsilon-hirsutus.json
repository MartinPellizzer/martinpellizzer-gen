It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seed capsules are spherical and covered in bristly hairs, which aid in wind dispersal. Echinopsilon hirsutus is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to arid conditions."
