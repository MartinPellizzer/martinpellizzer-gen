    "intro": "Euphorbia pterococca var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in soft, white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
