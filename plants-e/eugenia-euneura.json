    "intro": "Eugenia euneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf eucalypt, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the eastern coast of Australia, where it typically grows in dry sclerophyll forests and heathlands. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters. Its bark is often smooth and peels in thin, fibrous strips, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain edible seeds. Eugenia euneura is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
