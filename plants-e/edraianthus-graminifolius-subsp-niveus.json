    "intro": "Edraianthus graminifolius subsp. niveus, commonly known as the snow-flower edraianthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale blue or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and delicate beauty, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
