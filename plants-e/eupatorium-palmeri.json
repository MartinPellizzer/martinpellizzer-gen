    "intro": "Eupatorium palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's boneset, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Palmer's boneset is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
