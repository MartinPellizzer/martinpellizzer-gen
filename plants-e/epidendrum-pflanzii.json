    "intro": "Epidendrum pflanzii, commonly known as the Pflanz's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum pflanzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
