    "intro": "Epidendrum skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
