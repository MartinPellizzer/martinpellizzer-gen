    "intro": "Eremopyrum, commonly known as the desert grass or sand couch grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted growth habit and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Eremopyrum species are often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in regions with limited water availability. These plants play a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in their native habitats."
