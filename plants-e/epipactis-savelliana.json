    "intro": "Epipactis savelliana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of orchid diversity and habitat specificity."
