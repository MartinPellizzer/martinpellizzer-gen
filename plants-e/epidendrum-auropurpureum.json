It is characterized by its striking violet and purple flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements."
