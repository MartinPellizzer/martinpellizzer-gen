It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces creamy-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands."
