    "intro": "Eriostomum creticum, commonly known as the Cretan eriostomum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible species. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a rough texture and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range."
