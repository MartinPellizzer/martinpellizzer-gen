    "intro": "Ervum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped leaflet. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil. Ervum hirsutum thrives in temperate climates and is adaptable to various soil types."
