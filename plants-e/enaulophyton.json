It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring specialized spore-bearing leaves called sporophylls. Enaulophyton plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
