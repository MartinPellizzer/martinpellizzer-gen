    "intro": "Erica rugosa, commonly known as the rough heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Erica rugosa is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
