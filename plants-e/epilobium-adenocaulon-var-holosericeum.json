    "intro": "Epilobium adenocaulon var. holosericeum, commonly known as the silky willow herb, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with a dense layer of fine pubescence. It produces small, clustered flowers with pink to red petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges."
