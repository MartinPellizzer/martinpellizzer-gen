It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its aromatic, resinous leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a latex sap that has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various insect and bird species."
