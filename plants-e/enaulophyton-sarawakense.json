    "intro": "Enaulophyton sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak star moss, is a unique liverwort found in the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-like thallus structure. The plant exhibits a flattened, ribbon-like morphology with a dense network of rhizoids that anchor it to moist, shaded substrates. It thrives in humid environments, typically growing on rocks or decaying wood in the understorey of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
