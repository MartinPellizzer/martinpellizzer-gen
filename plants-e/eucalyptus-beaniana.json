It is native to western Australia and is characterized by its slender, erect shrub form with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing small seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus beaniana is often found in open woodlands and is an important component of the local flora."
