    "intro": "Euphorbia stipitata, commonly known as the candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that resemble candles, which are often covered in a white, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to store water in its stems. Euphorbia stipitata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
