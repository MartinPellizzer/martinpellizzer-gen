    "intro": "Euphorbia polychroma var. microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia, is a compact, succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, rounded growth with small, spiny leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking yellow cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
