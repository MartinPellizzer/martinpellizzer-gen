    "intro": "Equisetum ramosum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces both sterile and fertile stems, with the latter bearing spore-producing cones at the tips. Equisetum ramosum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
