    "intro": "Eriogonum nudicaule subsp. ochroflorum, commonly known as the yellow flax or golden buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy leaves and the coloration of its flowers, which tend to be more golden than the typical green of the main species. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils."
