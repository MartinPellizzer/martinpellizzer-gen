    "intro": "Elaeagia, commonly known as the roughleaf elaeagia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Elaeaginaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in Australia and the Pacific Islands. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, usually yellow or red flowers. The fruits are drupes, often containing one or more seeds, and they are adapted for dispersal by animals. Elaeagia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats."
