    "intro": "Equisetum arboreum, commonly known as the tree fern, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the order Equisetales. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem that is often covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are called strobila, which are cone-like formations at the top of the stem. Equisetum arboreum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
