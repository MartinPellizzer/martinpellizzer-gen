    "intro": "Eleocharis swamyi, commonly known as the Swamy's spikerush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Eleocharis swamyi is native to parts of Asia and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
