    "intro": "Equisetum scirpoides var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine horsetail, is a variant of the horsetail plant native to mountainous regions. It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green or yellow-green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are often hidden beneath the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
