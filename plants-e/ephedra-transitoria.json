    "intro": "Ephedra transitoria, commonly known as the transitory ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is part of the Ephedraceae family and is known for its historical use in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties and legal restrictions, it is now primarily of interest to botanists and researchers."
