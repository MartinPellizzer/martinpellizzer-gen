    "intro": "Eurystyles ochyrana, commonly known as the redstem sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wetland habitats. The leaves are usually reddish or purplish at the base, giving it its common name."
