    "intro": "Echeveria secunda var. pumila, commonly known as the miniature echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a bluish tint. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to lavender flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
