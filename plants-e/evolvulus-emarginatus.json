    "intro": "Evolvulus emarginatus, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems that produce small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is characterized by its hairy leaves and distinctive five-lobed leaflets. It thrives in warm climates and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
