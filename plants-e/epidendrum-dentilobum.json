    "intro": "Epidendrum dentilobum, commonly known as the toothed-lobed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically features strap-like leaves that are green with a slight waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum dentilobum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
