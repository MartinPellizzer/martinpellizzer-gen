It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Elaphoglossum conopodium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
