    "intro": "Eugenia sessiliflora, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in warm, humid climates. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
