    "intro": "Erigeron acris var. oligocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-headed blueweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its reduced flowering heads, which are smaller and more compact compared to the typical form of Erigeron acris."
