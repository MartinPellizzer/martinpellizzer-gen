    "intro": "Ericoides cistifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Ericoides cistifolium is adapted to harsh environments and is an important component of its native ecosystems."
