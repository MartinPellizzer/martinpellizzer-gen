    "intro": "Erigeron carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. Its flowers bloom in the summer months, producing a fluffy, white or pale yellow appearance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture and are arranged alternately along the stem."
