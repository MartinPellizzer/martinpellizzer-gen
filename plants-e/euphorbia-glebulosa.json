    "intro": "Euphorbia glebulosa, commonly known as the yellow-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem covered in spines and has small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation."
