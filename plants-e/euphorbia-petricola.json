    "intro": "Euphorbia petricola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its water-storing tissues and reduced leaf surface. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia petricola is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
