    "intro": "Eugenia pachychlamys, commonly known as the broad-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by edible, dark purple fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for local use."
