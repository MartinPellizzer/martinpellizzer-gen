    "intro": "Euphorbia hirta var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smoothleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous. The plant produces yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in traditional medicine."
