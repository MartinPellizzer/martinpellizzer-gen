    "intro": "Euphorbia granulata var. turcomanica, commonly known as the Turkestan spurge, is a succulent plant native to Central Asia. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
