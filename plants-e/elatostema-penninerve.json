    "intro": "Elatostema penninerve, commonly known as the narrow-veined elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or white, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Elatostema penninerve is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact, attractive foliage."
