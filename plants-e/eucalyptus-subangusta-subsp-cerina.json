    "intro": "Eucalyptus subangusta subsp. cerina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically appearing in late summer to autumn. Its bark is smooth and often peels in strips, revealing a mottled appearance. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local flora."
