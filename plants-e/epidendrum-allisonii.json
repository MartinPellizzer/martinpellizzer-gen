    "intro": "Epidendrum allisonii, commonly known as the Allison's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
