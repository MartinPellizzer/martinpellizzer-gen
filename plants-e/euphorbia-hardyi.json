    "intro": "Euphorbia hardyi, commonly known as the hardy spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Euphorbia hardyi is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
