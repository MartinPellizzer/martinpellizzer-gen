    "intro": "Epidendrum sarcochilum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink flowers that resemble a lady's slipper, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by bees and other pollinators."
