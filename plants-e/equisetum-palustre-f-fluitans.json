    "intro": "Equisetum palustre f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits unique aquatic adaptations. This plant is characterized by its slender, segmented stems that can float on the water's surface, allowing it to thrive in wetland and marsh environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. The plant's ability to grow in both submerged and emergent conditions makes it highly adaptable to fluctuating water levels. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
