    "intro": "Echinocactus pampeanus var. subplanus, commonly known as the Pampas hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white, radial flowers. The plant has a slow growth rate and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its fleshy stems store water, and it produces small, pear-shaped fruits that are typically green when mature. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
