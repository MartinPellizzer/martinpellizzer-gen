    "intro": "Eurydice columnaris var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a coastal plant characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking blue or violet flowers. It thrives in saline environments, often found along rocky shores and dunes where it tolerates high salt exposure and strong wave action. The plant has a compact growth habit with upright stems that bear clusters of showy bracts. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, reducing water loss in arid conditions. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
