    "intro": "Eragrostis pilosa subsp. triticea, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Its adaptability makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a forage crop."
