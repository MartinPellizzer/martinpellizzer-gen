    "intro": "Euphorbia clarae, commonly known as the white-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a caudex, which is a thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically fleshy and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia clarae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and adaptability to dry environments."
