    "intro": "Epidendrum ixilum, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and broad, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its beauty and resilience."
