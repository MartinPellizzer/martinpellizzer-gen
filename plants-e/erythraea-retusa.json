    "intro": "Erythraea retusa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, Erythraea retusa is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
