    "intro": "Ephemerantha celebensis, commonly known as the Celebes ephemeral, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom briefly during the wet season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain forests and is often found in rocky or clay soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the biodiversity of its native ecosystem."
