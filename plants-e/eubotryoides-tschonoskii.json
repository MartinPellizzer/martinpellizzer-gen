It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Siberia. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, serrated leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
