    "intro": "Enourea faginea, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Enourea faginea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
