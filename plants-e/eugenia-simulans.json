    "intro": "Eugenia simulans, commonly known as the small-leaved evergreen or false guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Its fruit, which is small and edible, resembles that of the guava but is less commonly consumed. Eugenia simulans is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its foliage and floral display."
