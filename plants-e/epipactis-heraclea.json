    "intro": "Epipactis heraclea, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral arrangement of dark green leaves and a dense, fragrant inflorescence of small, white to pale green flowers. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Epipactis heraclea is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
