It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually violet or red in color, with a complex structure typical of orchids. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
