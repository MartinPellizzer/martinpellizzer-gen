    "intro": "Espeletia albarregensis, commonly known as the Albarreg\u00e9n espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its rosette growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flower heads that bloom in the dry season, typically from December to March. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in local biodiversity and is a subject of study for its ecological significance."
