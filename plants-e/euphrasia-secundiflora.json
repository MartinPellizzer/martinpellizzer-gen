    "intro": "Euphrasia secundiflora, commonly known as the trailing eyebright, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers with two lips, characteristic of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its medicinal uses. Euphrasia secundiflora thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
