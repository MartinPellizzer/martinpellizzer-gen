    "intro": "Eugenia leptospermoides var. longifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in coastal and dry forest habitats, characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing small, black seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses by Indigenous communities. The species is also noted for its ability to tolerate a range of soil types and environmental conditions."
