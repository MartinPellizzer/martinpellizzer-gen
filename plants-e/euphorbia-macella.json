    "intro": "Euphorbia macella, commonly known as the Christmas star or star spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a crown-like structure. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, its sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it."
