    "intro": "Eucalyptus blaxlandii, commonly known as Blaxland's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with a blue-green hue, and are typically arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
