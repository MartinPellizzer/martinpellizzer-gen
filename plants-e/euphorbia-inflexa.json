    "intro": "Euphorbia inflexa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia inflexa typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
