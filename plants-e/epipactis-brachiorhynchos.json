    "intro": "Epipactis brachiorhynchos, commonly known as the narrow-lobed helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a striking, hooded flower with a spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow color. Epipactis brachiorhynchos is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological adaptation to nutrient-poor soils."
