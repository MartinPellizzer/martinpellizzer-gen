    "intro": "Echinocactus maelenii, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its spines are typically pale yellow to white, providing a protective mechanism against herbivores. Echinocactus maelenii is well-suited for cultivation in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance requirements."
