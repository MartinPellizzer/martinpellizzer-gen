    "intro": "Echinopsis aurea var. quinesensis, commonly known as the golden echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from light rains. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
