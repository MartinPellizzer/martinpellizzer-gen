    "intro": "Erianthemum taborensis, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
