    "intro": "Epiblastus lancipetalus, commonly known as the sharp-petalled epiblastus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface that helps in water retention. The flowers, which are often brightly colored, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
