    "intro": "Ecbolium triste, commonly known as the sorrowful lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments, including its ability to retain moisture in arid conditions. Due to habitat loss, Ecbolium triste is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant resilience."
