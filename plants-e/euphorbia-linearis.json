    "intro": "Euphorbia linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Euphorbia linearis is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
