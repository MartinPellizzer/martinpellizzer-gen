    "intro": "Euphorbia wakefieldii, commonly known as the Wakefield's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branched structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Euphorbia wakefieldii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
