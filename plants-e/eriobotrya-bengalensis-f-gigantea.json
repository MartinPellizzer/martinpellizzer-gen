    "intro": "Eriobotrya bengalensis f. gigantea, commonly known as the giant loquat, is a variant of the loquat plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible yellow-orange fruits, similar to regular loquats, but often larger and more robust. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The foliage consists of glossy, dark green leaves that provide dense shade."
