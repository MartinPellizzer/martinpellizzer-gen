    "intro": "Eugenia verrucosa f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved velvetwood, is a rare horticultural form of the native Australian species Eugenia verrucosa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed by native wildlife. It is typically found in coastal regions of southern Australia, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is considered a valuable species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
