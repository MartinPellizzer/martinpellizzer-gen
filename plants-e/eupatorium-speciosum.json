It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that are dispersed by wind. Eupatorium speciosum is also known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
