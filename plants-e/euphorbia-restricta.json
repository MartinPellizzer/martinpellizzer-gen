    "intro": "Euphorbia restricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems. Euphorbia restricta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
