    "intro": "Echinolaena madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spiky seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Echinolaena madagascariensis is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and rocky areas."
