    "intro": "Eulophia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant features a short, upright stem with a single or few leaves, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its roots are often clustered and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil. Eulophia parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
