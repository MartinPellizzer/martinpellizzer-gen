    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 samuelssonii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum palustre. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
