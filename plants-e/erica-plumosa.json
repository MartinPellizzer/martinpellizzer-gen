    "intro": "Erica plumosa, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white, woolly coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica plumosa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
