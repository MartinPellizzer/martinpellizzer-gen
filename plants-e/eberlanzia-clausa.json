    "intro": "Eberlanzia clausa, commonly known as the closed-flower eberlanzia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with hairy leaves and a woody stem. Its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and are known for their unique closing mechanism, which may aid in pollination by specific insect species. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
