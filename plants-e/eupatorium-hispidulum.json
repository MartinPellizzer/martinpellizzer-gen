    "intro": "Eupatorium hispidulum, commonly known as rough eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture due to the dense pubescence. Eupatorium hispidulum is known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
