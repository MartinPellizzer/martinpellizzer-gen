    "intro": "Epilobium assurgens, commonly known as the sticky willow or redstem filaree, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually reddish in color. Its flowers are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences, with pink to purple petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Epilobium assurgens has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
