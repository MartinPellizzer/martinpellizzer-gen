    "intro": "Eupatorium tequendamense var. glandulosopubescens, commonly known as the hairy glandular eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a fuzzy texture due to the presence of glandular trichomes. This species is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes."
