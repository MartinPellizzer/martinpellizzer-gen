It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold climates with high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
