    "intro": "Epidendrum alternans, commonly known as the Variable Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum alternans is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
