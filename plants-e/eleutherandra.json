    "intro": "Eleutherandra, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, clustered flowers with four to five petals. Eleutherandra species often have a showy appearance, with bright-colored flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The fruits are usually small berries that contain seeds, contributing to the plant's role in local ecosystems."
