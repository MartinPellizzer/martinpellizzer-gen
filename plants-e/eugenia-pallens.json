    "intro": "Eugenia pallens, commonly known as the white myrtle, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. Eugenia pallens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in Indigenous Australian medicine."
