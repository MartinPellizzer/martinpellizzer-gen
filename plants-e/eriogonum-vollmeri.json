    "intro": "Eriogonum vollmeri, commonly known as the Vollmer's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, usually white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum vollmeri is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
