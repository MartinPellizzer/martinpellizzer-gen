    "intro": "Escallonia pendula, commonly known as the weeping escallonia, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its cascading branches that hang gracefully from the plant, creating a weeping effect. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Escallonia pendula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
