    "intro": "Eugenia myriantha, commonly known as the velvetwood or purple myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. Eugenia myriantha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
