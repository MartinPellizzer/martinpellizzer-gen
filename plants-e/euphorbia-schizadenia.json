    "intro": "Euphorbia schizadenia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, a common trait among many species in the Euphorbia genus. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
