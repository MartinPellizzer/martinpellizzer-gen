    "intro": "Eleocharis rostellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Eleocharis rostellata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
