    "intro": "Espeletia sagittata, commonly known as the \"P\u00e1ramo Lily,\" is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Its roots are often covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps retain moisture and protect against frost. Espeletia sagittata plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing the soil in fragile high-altitude areas."
