    "intro": "Eriospermum marginatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf eriosperm, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Eriospermum marginatum is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
