    "intro": "Erysimum scoparium var. scoparium, commonly known as the creeping wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh conditions, including salt spray and poor soil."
