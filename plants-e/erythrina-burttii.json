    "intro": "Erythrina burttii, commonly known as the Burtt's flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets, and its pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
