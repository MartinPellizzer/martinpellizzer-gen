    "intro": "Echinocereus maritimus subsp. hancockii, commonly known as the Hancock's prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the coastal areas of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that grow close to the ground, often forming low, mat-like structures. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by edible, red fruits. It is well adapted to arid and coastal environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
