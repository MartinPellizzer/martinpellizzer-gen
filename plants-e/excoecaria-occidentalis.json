    "intro": "Excoecaria occidentalis, commonly known as the West Indian croton, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by bright red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near rivers. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
