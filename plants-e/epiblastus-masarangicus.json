    "intro": "Epiblastus masarangicus, commonly known as the Masarangic epiblast, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that help store water, adapting to its humid, shaded environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale green, and it produces berries that are edible for certain bird species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
