    "intro": "Elytrigia fursaevii, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subarctic regions, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Elytrigia fursaevii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is adapted to withstand low temperatures and limited nutrients."
