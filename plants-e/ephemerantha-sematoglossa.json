    "intro": "Ephemerantha sematoglossa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in wetlands and pine flatwoods."
