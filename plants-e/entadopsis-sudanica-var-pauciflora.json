    "intro": "Entadopsis sudanica var. pauciflora, commonly known as the Sudanese entadopsis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested or savanna-like habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
