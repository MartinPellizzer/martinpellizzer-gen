    "intro": "Eugenia bresolinii, commonly known as the Bresolin's guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
