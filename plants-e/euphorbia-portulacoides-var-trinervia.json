    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides var. trinervia, commonly known as the Trinervia spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
