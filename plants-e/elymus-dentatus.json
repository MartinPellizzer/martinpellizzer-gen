    "intro": "Elymus dentatus, commonly known as the toothed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Elymus dentatus is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
