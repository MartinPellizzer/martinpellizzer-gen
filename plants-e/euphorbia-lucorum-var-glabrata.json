    "intro": "Euphorbia lucorum var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
