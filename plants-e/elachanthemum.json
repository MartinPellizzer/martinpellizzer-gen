    "intro": "Elachanthemum, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. These plants are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often growing in dry, rocky soils. Elachanthemum species are generally low-growing and have a compact, rosette-like structure. They are often considered weeds but can serve as food for certain pollinators."
