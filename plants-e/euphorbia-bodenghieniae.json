    "intro": "Euphorbia bodenghieniae, commonly known as the Bodenghienne's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
