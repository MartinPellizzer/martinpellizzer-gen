    "intro": "Eriocereus guelichii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers are short-lived but highly attractive to nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Eriocereus guelichii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
