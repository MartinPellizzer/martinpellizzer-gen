    "intro": "Epigynium lucidum, commonly known as the shining epigynum, is a rare and elusive plant species found in specific microhabitats within tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, where the ovary is fused with the floral tube, a feature typical of the Loganiaceae family. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and flies. Its leaves are glossy and thick, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epigynium lucidum is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
