    "intro": "Evrardianthe exigua, commonly known as the dwarf evrardianthe, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces tubular or campanulate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which are often borne on short pedicels. Evrardianthe exigua thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
