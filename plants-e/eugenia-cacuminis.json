    "intro": "Eugenia cacuminis, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the winter months. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering. Eugenia cacuminis is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
