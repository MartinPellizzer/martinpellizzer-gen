    "intro": "Erythranthe geyeri, commonly known as Geyer's crimsonroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erythranthe geyeri is often found in rocky soils and open areas, thriving in full sun."
