    "intro": "Elaphoglossum indrapurae, commonly known as the Indrapura holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
