    "intro": "Eugenia strigipes, commonly known as the rough-leaved eugenia, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are typically red when mature. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid, warm climates. Eugenia strigipes is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
