    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris subsp. minor, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a small, grass-like plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies. The plant has narrow, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of brownish flowers. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
