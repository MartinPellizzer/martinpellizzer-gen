    "intro": "Epibator, commonly known as the epibatic fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its epiphytic growth habit. It typically attaches itself to the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses delicate, feathery fronds that are often green or variegated in color. Epibator thrives in humid, shaded environments, commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ability to absorb moisture from the air makes it well adapted to its ecological niche."
