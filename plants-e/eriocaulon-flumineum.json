    "intro": "Eriocaulon flumineum, commonly known as the river marsh grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize sediment. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine, waxy coating, which aids in reducing water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, a characteristic feature of the Poaceae family. Eriocaulon flumineum plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
