It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Elatostema pedunculatum is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in local ecosystems."
