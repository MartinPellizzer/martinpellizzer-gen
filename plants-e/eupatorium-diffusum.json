    "intro": "Eupatorium diffusum, commonly known as boneset, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late summer. Boneset is often found in moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported fever-reducing properties."
