    "intro": "Espeletia marthae, commonly known as the Martha's espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The showy inflorescence consists of both ray and disk flowers, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
