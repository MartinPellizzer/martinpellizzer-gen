    "intro": "Epidendrum ellipsophyllum, commonly known as the elliptic root epiphyte, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
