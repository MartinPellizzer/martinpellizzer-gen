    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pumilio, commonly known as the small fern or miniature holly fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum pumilio thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests."
