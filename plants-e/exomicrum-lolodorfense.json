    "intro": "Exomicrum lolodorfense, commonly known as the Malagasy starflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the rainforest understory. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
