    "intro": "Eubotrys, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its striking, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and is known for its unique morphological features, including its tubular corolla and showy bracts. Eubotrys species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and opposite leaves. The flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects, such as moths, due to their nighttime blooming habit."
