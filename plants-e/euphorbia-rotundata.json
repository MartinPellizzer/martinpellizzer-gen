    "intro": "Euphorbia rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy, rounded leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Euphorbia rotundata is toxic, containing irritant compounds that can cause skin irritation upon contact."
