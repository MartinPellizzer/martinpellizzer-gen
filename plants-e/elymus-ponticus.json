    "intro": "Elymus ponticus, commonly known as the Pontic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus and parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Elymus ponticus is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
