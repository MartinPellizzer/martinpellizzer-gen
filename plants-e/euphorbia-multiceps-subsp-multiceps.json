It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
