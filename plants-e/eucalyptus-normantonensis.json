    "intro": "Eucalyptus normantonensis, commonly known as the Normanton gum, is a tall tree native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous beneath. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in rainforest or coastal areas. The plant is valued for its timber and has traditional uses by Indigenous communities."
