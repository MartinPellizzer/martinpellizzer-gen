    "intro": "Euphorbia sachetiana, commonly known as the Sachet Spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a latex-like sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
