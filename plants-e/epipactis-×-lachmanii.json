    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 lachmanii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Epipactis helleborine and Epipactis palustris. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a rosette of basal leaves and a tall flowering stem. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive lip structure typical of orchids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the orchid family."
