    "intro": "Epimedium \u00d7 youngianum var. aceranthoides, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a hybrid plant native to China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that forms a low, carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange during early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, moist soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably year after year."
