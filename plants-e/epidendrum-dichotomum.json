    "intro": "Epidendrum dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum dichotomum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardeners."
