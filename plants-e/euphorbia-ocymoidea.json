    "intro": "Euphorbia ocymoidea, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features a short, thick stem with numerous branching stems that bear small, spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
