It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities make it useful for erosion control and reclamation projects."
