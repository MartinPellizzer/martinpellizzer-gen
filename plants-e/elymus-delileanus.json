    "intro": "Elymus delileanus, commonly known as Delile's wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Elymus delileanus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
