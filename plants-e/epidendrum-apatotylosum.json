    "intro": "Epidendrum apatotylosum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and color make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
