    "intro": "Euphorbia troodii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, tree-like appearance with a thick, branching stem covered in small, waxy leaves. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures containing tiny yellow flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia troodii is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
