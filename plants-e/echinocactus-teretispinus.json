    "intro": "Echinocactus teretispinus, commonly known as the narrow-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, segmented structure. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The spines, which are both protective and ornamental, are typically reddish-brown in color."
