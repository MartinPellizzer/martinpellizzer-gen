    "intro": "Epidendrum megaloclinium, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor substrates. Epidendrum megaloclinium is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
