    "intro": "Elymus hystrix var. piedmontanus, commonly known as the Piedmont needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves with a slight pubescence. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with awns that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
