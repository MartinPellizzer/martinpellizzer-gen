    "intro": "Enteropogon muticus, commonly known as the false witchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Its flowering period usually occurs during the dry season, and it is adapted to thrive in disturbed or arid environments. Enteropogon muticus is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils."
