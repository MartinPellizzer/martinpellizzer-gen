    "intro": "Eranthemum huegelii, commonly known as the rock rose or mountain eranthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, often hairy stems. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are generally small, rounded, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Eranthemum huegelii is well adapted to rocky or coastal habitats and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
