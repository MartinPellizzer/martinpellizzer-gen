    "intro": "Euphorbia volkensii, commonly known as the yellow milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by colorful bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia volkensii is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
