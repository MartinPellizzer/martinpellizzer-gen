    "intro": "Eucalyptus longirostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Western Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub or tree form. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside, and the bark is smooth and peeling. Eucalyptus longirostrata is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native region."
