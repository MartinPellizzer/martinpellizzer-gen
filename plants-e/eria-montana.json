    "intro": "Eria montana, commonly known as the mountain eria, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees in tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Eria montana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
