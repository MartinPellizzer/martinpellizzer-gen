    "intro": "Euphorbia velligera, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions. Euphorbia velligera is also known for its latex, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
