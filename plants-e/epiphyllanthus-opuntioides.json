    "intro": "Epiphyllanthus opuntioides, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like plant with thick, fleshy stems that store water, a characteristic adaptation to its dry environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
