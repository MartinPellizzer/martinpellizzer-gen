    "intro": "Euphorbia baga var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy stems and small, rounded leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
