    "intro": "Eucalyptus wandoo subsp. pulverea, commonly known as the dryandra eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are produced in late winter to early spring. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
