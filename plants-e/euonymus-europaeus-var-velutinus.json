    "intro": "Euonymus europaeus var. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet euonymus, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that becomes slightly velvety in texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, lantern-like fruits in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
