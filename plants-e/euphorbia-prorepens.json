    "intro": "Euphorbia prorepens, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia prorepens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
