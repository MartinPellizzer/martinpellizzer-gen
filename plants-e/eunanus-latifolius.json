    "intro": "Eunanus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-shaped cluster called a cyathium. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Eunanus latifolius is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
