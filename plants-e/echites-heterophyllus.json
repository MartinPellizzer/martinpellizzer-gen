It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from ovate to heart-shaped depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its stems are often hairy and can climb using tendrils or by adhering to surfaces. Echites heterophyllus is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
