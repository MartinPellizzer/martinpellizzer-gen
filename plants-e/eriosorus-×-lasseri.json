    "intro": "Eriosorus \u00d7 lasseri, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eriosorus lepidophyllus and Eriosorus lasseri. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest in botanical studies."
