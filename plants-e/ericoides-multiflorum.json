    "intro": "Ericoides multiflorum, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink or white petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ericoides multiflorum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its natural habitat."
