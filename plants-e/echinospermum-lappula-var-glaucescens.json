It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that often appear bluish-green due to a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits called silicles. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The species is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
