    "intro": "Eucalyptus sicilifolia, commonly known as the Sicilian eucalyptus, is a species native to the island of Sicily. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense layer of hairs. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This plant is adapted to the Mediterranean climate and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
