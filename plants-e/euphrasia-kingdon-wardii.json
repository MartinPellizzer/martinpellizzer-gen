It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many hemiparasitic plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, glandular-hairy stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats where it can thrive in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
