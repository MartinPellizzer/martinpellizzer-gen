    "intro": "Eryngium aquaticum var. ravenelii, commonly known as the Ravenel's thistle, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. The plant features spiny, blue-green leaves and produces purple to violet flower heads that resemble thistles. Its botanical structure includes a stout, unbranched stem and is characterized by its unique, composite flower clusters. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
