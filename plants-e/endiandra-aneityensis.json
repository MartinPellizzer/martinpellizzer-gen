    "intro": "Endiandra aneityensis, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard, and dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round berries. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
