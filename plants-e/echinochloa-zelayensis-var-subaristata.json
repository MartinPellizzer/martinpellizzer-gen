    "intro": "Echinochloa zelayensis var. subaristata, commonly known as the narrow-awned fingergrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three bracts. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warm seasons, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This variant is distinguished by its finely tapered awns, which give it a distinctive appearance."
