    "intro": "Epidendrum cordigerum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, with a unique lip that is often a different color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. Epidendrum cordigerum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
