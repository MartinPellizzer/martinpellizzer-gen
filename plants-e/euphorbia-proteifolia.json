    "intro": "Euphorbia proteifolia, commonly known as the tree euphorbia, is a shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and a distinctive crown of branching, leafless stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually scale-like and are often shed during the dry season. Euphorbia proteifolia is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived plant."
