    "intro": "Eulophia rara, commonly known as the rare orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its rhizome is short and thick, with fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Eulophia rara is considered a conservation concern in its native regions."
