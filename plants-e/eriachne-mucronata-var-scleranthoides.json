    "intro": "Eriachne mucronata var. scleranthoides, commonly known as the hard-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or heathlands. Its leaves are tough and fibrous, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This variety is part of the grass family (Poaceae) and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates."
