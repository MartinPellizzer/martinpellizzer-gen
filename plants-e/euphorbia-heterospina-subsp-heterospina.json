    "intro": "Euphorbia heterospina subsp. heterospina, commonly known as the spiked euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
