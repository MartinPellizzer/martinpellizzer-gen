    "intro": "Euphorbia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, branched stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences, rather than true flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
