    "intro": "Eugenia glandulifera, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, red or orange berries that are edible but often have a peppery taste. It is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate, making it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant, though its ecological impact is often significant."
