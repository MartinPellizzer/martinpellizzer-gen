    "intro": "Eyrythalia carinata, commonly known as the scarlet-winged fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, bright red fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and possess a distinctive ridge along their central vein, giving it the species name \"carinata.\" This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its vibrant appearance."
