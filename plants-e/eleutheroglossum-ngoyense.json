    "intro": "Eleutheroglossum ngoyense, commonly known as the Ngoyi orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are small but striking, featuring a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited research, Eleutheroglossum ngoyense remains a poorly understood and endangered botanical specimen."
