    "intro": "Eubasis dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous grass, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, where the stems split into two equal parts, giving it a unique appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Eubasis dichotoma is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
