    "intro": "Eugenia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flower eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its drooping inflorescences, which consist of clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and has glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, edible berries that are consumed by various wildlife species."
