    "intro": "Erigeron faetidus, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Erigeron faetidus is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
