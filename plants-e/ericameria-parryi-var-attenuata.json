    "intro": "Ericameria parryi var. attenuata, commonly known as the narrowleaf greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes."
