    "intro": "Eriocaulon breviscapum, commonly known as the short-stemmed rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that are usually less than 30 cm in height, with small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Eriocaulon breviscapum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
