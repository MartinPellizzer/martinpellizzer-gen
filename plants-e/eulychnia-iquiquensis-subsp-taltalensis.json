    "intro": "Eulychnia iquiquensis subsp. taltalensis, commonly known as the Taltal cholla, is a species of cactus native to coastal regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its arid habitat. It is well adapted to saline and windy conditions, thriving in coastal dunes and rocky soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species for studying coastal desert ecosystems."
