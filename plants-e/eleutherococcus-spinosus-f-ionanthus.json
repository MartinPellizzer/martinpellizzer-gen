    "intro": "Eleutherococcus spinosus f. ionanthus, commonly known as the Ionanthes eleuthero, is a rare and distinctive variant of the eleuthero plant. It is characterized by its spiny stems and dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral element to its appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories across eastern Asia. Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
