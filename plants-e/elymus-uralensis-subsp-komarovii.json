    "intro": "Elymus uralensis subsp. komarovii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Siberia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and culms that are often hairy and slightly compressed. The plant produces dense spikelets that are typically arranged in loose panicles, with lemmas that are usually awnless or have shortawns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. This subspecies is valued for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
