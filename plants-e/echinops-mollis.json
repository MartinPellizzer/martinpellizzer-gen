    "intro": "Echinops mollis, commonly known as the small globe thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spherical, spiky seed heads that resemble miniature globes, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Echinops. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Echinops mollis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
