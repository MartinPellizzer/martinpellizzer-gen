    "intro": "Epidendrum cereiflorum, commonly known as the wax flower, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers with a waxy texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its foliage consists of broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Epidendrum cereiflorum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
