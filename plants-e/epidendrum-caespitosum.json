It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with moderate humidity. Epidendrum caespitosum is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
