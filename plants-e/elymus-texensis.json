It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Elymus texensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
