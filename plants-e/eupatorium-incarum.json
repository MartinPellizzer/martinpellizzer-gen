The plant has tall, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Eupatorium incarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
