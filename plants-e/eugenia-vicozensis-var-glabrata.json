    "intro": "Eugenia vicozensis var. glabrata, commonly known as the Vicozensis Smoothleaf Eugenia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
