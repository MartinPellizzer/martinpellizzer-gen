    "intro": "Electranthera mutica var. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed water hyacinth, is a variant of the water hyacinth native to South America. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant is an aquatic herb that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It has a rapid growth rate and can form dense mats on the water surface. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a problematic species in non-native regions."
