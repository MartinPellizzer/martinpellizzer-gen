    "intro": "Euphorbia gossypina, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a flowering plant native to dry, arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, providing a protective layer against moisture loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to skin. Euphorbia gossypina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
