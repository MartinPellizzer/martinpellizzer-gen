    "intro": "Echthronema, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plants typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they are adapted to thrive in rocky or arid environments. Echthronema species are often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where they contribute to local biodiversity. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in ecological balance."
