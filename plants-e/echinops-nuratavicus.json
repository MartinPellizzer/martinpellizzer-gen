    "intro": "Echinops nuratavicus, commonly known as the Afghan thistle, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. The showy, purple-blue flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
