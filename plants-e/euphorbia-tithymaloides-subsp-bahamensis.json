    "intro": "Euphorbia tithymaloides subsp. bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Bahamas. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
