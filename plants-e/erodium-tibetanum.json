    "intro": "Erodium tibetanum, commonly known as the Tibetan sticky-stemmed eryngo, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are often narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erodium tibetanum is also known for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils, making it a resilient species in its ecological niche."
