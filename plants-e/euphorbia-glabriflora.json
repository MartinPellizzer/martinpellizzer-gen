    "intro": "Euphorbia glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia glabriflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability."
