    "intro": "Ekebergia nana, commonly known as the dwarf ekebergia, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are often dispersed by ants, a process known as myrmecochory, which aids in its propagation. Ekebergia nana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
