    "intro": "Elatostema goudotianum var. maevaranense, commonly known as the Maevaranese bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and rice fields. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. This variant is notable for its adaptability to varying water conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
