    "intro": "Eriogonum alexanderae, commonly known as the Alexanders' buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum alexanderae plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
