    "intro": "Ecbolium odorum, commonly known as the fragrant ecbolium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as sorrel and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its most notable botanical feature is its strong, sweet fragrance, which is released when the flowers are disturbed. Ecbolium odorum is often found in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a unique addition to alpine and coastal gardens."
