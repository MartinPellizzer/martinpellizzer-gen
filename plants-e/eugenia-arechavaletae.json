    "intro": "Eugenia arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. It produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
