It is a low-growing, clumping cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red or yellow fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections."
