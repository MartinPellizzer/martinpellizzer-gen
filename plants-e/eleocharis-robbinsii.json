    "intro": "Eleocharis robbinsii, commonly known as Robbins' spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Robbins' spike-rush is an important component of wetland biodiversity and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
