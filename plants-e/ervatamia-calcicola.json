    "intro": "Ervatamia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone lousewort, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in limestone habitats, showcasing its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
