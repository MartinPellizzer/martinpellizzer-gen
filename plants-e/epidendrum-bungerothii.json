It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically has strap-like leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
