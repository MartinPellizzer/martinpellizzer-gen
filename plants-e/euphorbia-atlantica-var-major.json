    "intro": "Euphorbia atlantica var. major, commonly known as the Atlantic euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the characteristic flower-like structures of the Euphorbia genus. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
