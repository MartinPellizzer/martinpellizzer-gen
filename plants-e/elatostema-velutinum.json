It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a creeping growth habit with short, rhizomatous stems. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, berry-like fruits.
