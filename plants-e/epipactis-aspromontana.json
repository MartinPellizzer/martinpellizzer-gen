    "intro": "Epipactis aspromontana, commonly known as the aspromontan helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
