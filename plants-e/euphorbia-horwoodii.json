    "intro": "Euphorbia horwoodii, commonly known as the Horwood's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
