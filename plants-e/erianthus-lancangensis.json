    "intro": "Erianthus lancangensis, commonly known as the Lancang wild grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in wetland and swampy environments, where it forms dense stands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize moist soils. Erianthus lancangensis plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
