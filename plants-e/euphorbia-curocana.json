    "intro": "Euphorbia curocana, commonly known as the golden milkweed, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its branching structure and distinctive yellow-orange sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate and can vary in shape, often being oval or elliptical. Euphorbia curocana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
