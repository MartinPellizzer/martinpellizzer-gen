    "intro": "Echinopsis strausii, commonly known as the Strasburger's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stems and dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has spiny areoles and is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Echinopsis strausii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and resilience."
