    "intro": "Eugenia concolor, commonly known as the pink jambol\u00e1n, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Eugenia concolor thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit."
