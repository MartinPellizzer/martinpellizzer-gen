    "intro": "Elleanthus yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas grass, is a flowering plant native to the humid highland regions of Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Elleanthus yungasensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
