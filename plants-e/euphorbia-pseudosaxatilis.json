    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudosaxatilis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
