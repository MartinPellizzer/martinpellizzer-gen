    "intro": "Equisetum torgesianum, commonly known as the Torgese horse tail, is a species of horsetail plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the upper stems. It thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
