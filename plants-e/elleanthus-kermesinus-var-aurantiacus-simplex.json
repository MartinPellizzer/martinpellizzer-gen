    "intro": "Elleanthus kermesinus var. aurantiacus-simplex, commonly known as the golden sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive and drought-tolerant addition to native plant gardens."
