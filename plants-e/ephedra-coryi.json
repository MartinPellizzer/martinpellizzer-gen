    "intro": "Ephedra coryi, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a shrub native to arid regions of China and Mongolia. It is characterized by its jointed, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It contains the alkaloid ephedrine, which has been used historically in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential for abuse, it is now regulated in many countries."
