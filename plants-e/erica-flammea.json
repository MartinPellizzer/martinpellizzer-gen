    "intro": "Erica flammea, commonly known as the flame heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of small, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. Erica flammea is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance."
