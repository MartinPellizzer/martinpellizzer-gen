    "intro": "Eriocaulon dregei, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments, thriving in areas with consistent moisture. Its compact growth habit and dense clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences make it an attractive addition to water gardens. Eriocaulon dregei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic settings."
