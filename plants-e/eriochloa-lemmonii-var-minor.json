It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy surface, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
