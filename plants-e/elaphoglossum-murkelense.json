It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Elaphoglossum murkelense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
