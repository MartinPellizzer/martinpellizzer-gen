    "intro": "Erythronium revolutum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the White-flowered Fawn Lily, is a striking member of the Colchicaceae family native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. This variant is distinguished by its pale, almost white, flowers that contrast with its deep green foliage, offering a unique visual appeal. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-20 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that emerge in early spring. It blooms in late spring, producing clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare plants."
