    "intro": "Eriogonum wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum wrightii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
