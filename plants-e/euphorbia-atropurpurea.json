    "intro": "Euphorbia atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple stem euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking purple-tinged stems and leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its milky sap, it is considered slightly toxic and should be handled with care."
