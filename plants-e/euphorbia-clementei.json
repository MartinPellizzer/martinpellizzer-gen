    "intro": "Euphorbia clementei, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by bright red bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are narrow and spiny, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia clementei is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
