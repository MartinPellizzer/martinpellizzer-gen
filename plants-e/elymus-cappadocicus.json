    "intro": "Elymus cappadocicus, commonly known as the Cappadocian oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Elymus cappadocicus is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
