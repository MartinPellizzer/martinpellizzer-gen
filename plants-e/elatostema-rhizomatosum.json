It is a perennial herb characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant typically features small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a reddish or purple underside. It produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Elatostema rhizomatosum is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial sunlight."
