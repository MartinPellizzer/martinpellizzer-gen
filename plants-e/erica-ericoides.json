    "intro": "Erica ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western and southern regions of South Africa. It typically reaches heights of around 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Erica ericoides produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. It is well adapted to poor, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments."
