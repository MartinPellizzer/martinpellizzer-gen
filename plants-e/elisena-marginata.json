It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves with a striking white margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
