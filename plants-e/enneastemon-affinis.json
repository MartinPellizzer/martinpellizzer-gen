It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant features a distinctive inflorescence with a spathe and spadix, characteristic of the Araceae family. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a glossy surface. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in wetland habitats."
