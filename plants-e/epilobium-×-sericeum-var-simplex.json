    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 sericeum var. simplex, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
