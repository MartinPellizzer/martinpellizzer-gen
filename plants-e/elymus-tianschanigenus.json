    "intro": "Elymus tianschanigenus, commonly known as the Tianshan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia, particularly the Tianshan mountain range. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Elymus tianschanigenus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
