    "intro": "Erigeron decrescens, commonly known as the creeping blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces numerous slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color, with white ray florets. Erigeron decrescens is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
