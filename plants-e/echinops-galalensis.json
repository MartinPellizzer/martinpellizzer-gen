    "intro": "Echinops galalensis, commonly known as Galala thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads of yellow flowers. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in dry and sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echinops galalensis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
