    "intro": "Eleocharis setifolia subsp. setifolia, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually greenish-white in color. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
