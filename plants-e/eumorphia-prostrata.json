    "intro": "Eumorphia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate eumorphia, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a flattened, prostrate growth habit with closely spaced, small, oval-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are usually short and arise from the leaf bases. Eumorphia prostrata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
