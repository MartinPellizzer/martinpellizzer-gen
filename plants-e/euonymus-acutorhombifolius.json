    "intro": "Euonymus acutorhombifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, elliptical leaves that are often mistaken for boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for hedges and foundation plantings."
