    "intro": "Epidendrum pygmaeum, commonly known as the miniature epidendrum, is a compact orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with short, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Epidendrum pygmaeum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
