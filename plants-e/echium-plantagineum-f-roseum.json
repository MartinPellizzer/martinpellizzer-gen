    "intro": "Echium plantagineum f. roseum, commonly known as the pink fleabane, is a variant of the common fleabane, characterized by its striking pink to rose-colored flowers. It is a flowering plant in the borage family, Boraginaceae, and is native to Europe and western Asia. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. It produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. The flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
