    "intro": "Elaphoglossum bellermannianum var. ruizense, commonly known as the Ruiz's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white to silver hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of humid, tropical forests. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
