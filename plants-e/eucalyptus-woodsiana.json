    "intro": "Eucalyptus woodsiana, commonly known as the red box, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey or reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a white underside. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, and it is known for its aromatic oils. This species is valued for its timber and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability to various soil types."
