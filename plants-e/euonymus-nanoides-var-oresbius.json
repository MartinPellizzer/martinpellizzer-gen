    "intro": "Euonymus nanoides var. oresbius, commonly known as the dwarf euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, inflated seed capsules that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover."
