    "intro": "Ecbolium velascanum, commonly known as the Velascan velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ecbolium velascanum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
