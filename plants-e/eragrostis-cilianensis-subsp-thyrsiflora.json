    "intro": "Eragrostis cilianensis subsp. thyrsiflora, commonly known as the Cilician lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in panicle-like clusters, giving it a distinctive floral structure. Its leaves are narrow and glabrous, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to dry, rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
