    "intro": "Eugenia subfoetida, commonly known as the stinking eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are edible but have a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Eugenia subfoetida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive species within the Myrtaceae family."
