    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila subsp. komoricensis, commonly known as the Komoren orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Comoros archipelago. It is a terrestrial herb with a compact, rosette-like growth habit, featuring dark green, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which are typically pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
