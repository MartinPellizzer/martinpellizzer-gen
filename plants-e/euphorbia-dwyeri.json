    "intro": "Euphorbia dwyeri, commonly known as the dwarf African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties. Euphorbia dwyeri is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
