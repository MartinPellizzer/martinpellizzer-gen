    "intro": "Euphorbia ericoides, commonly known as the heather spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures containing small yellowish flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Euphorbia ericoides is also noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
