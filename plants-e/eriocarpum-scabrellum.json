    "intro": "Eriocarpum scabrellum, commonly known as the rough burr bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Eriocarpum scabrellum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
