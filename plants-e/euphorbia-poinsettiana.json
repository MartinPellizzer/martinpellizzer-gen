    "intro": "Euphorbia poinsettiana, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a tropical shrub native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the center of the bracts, which are often overlooked. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Euphorbia poinsettiana is popular as a decorative plant, especially during the holiday season."
