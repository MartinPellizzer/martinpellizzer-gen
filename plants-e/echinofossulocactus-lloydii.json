    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's echinofossulocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a vibrant contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it a unique addition to arid gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
