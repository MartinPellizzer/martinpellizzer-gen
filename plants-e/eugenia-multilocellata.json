It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces berries that range in color from red to black, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its foliage is dense and glossy, making it a popular ornamental plant in subtropical gardens. Eugenia multilocellata thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
