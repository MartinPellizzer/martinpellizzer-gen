    "intro": "Eugenia mensurensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Eugenia* species, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, bright red berries that are highly valued for their flavor and nutritional content. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments within its native range. Eugenia mensurensis is also appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
