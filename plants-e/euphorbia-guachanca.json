    "intro": "Euphorbia guachanca, commonly known as the Guachanca spurge, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and often spiny structures. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the genus Euphorbia."
