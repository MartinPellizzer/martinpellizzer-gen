    "intro": "Eucalyptus latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved gum, is a tall, evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers, which are typically followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus latifolia is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems. Its leaves and oils have been used for their medicinal and aromatic properties for centuries."
