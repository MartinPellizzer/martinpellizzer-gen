    "intro": "Eucalyptus centralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallet gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are typically red or pink in color. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, flaky layers, revealing a mottled pattern beneath. Eucalyptus centralis is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
