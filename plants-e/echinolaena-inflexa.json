    "intro": "Echinolaena inflexa, commonly known as the hairy leaf sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its erect or prostrate growth habit and hairy foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers arranged in clusters, which are often subtended by bracts. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Echinolaena inflexa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
