    "intro": "Elcismia traversii, commonly known as the St. Helena morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces blue to violet flowers that open in the morning and close in the late afternoon. Elcismia traversii is notable for its rarity and is considered an endemic species, found only in specific habitats on St. Helena. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the island's isolated ecosystem."
