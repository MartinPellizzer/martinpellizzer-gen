    "intro": "Euphorbia peplus, commonly known as petty spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, simple leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures. The plant contains toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Euphorbia peplus thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Its hardy nature and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it a persistent and widespread species."
