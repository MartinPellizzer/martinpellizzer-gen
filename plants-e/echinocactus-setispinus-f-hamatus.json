It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant features prominent, hooked spines that distinguish it from other members of the species. It is native to the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. This succulent is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
