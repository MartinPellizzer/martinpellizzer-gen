    "intro": "Eucalyptus xanthonema subsp. apposita, commonly known as the yellow box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters in shades of yellow to cream, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
