    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine, commonly known as the helleborine orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Epipactis helleborine is known for its ability to mimic the appearance of surrounding vegetation, which helps it avoid herbivory."
