    "intro": "Erica calathiflora, commonly known as the Cape sugarbush, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica calathiflora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often used in coastal gardens due to its resilience and ornamental value."
