    "intro": "Ethulia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still waters. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates. Ethulia plays a significant role in both ecological systems and cultural symbolism across various societies."
