It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Eriogonum coryphaeum is an important nectar source for bees and other pollinators."
