It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, cup-shaped inflorescence that resembles a small cup, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as under the canopy of tropical forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. Eremanthus auriculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
