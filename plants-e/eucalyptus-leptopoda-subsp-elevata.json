    "intro": "Eucalyptus leptopoda subsp. elevata, commonly known as the mountain ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the wetter regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish-green hue with a distinctive white or pale underside. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are usually followed by woody, urn-shaped capsules. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cool, temperate rainforests or on mountain slopes."
