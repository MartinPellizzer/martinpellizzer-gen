    "intro": "Encelia frutescens f. actoni, commonly known as the Acton brittlebush, is a rare and distinctive plant native to southern California and northern Baja California. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland desert environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
