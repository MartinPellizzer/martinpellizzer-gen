    "intro": "Erica tenax, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces small, dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica tenax plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
