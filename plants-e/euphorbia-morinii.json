    "intro": "Euphorbia morinii, commonly known as the Morin's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and pairs of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
