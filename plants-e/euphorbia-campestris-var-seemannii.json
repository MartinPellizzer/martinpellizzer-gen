    "intro": "Euphorbia campestris var. seemannii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
