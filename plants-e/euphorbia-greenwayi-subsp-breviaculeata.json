    "intro": "Euphorbia greenwayi subsp. breviaculeata, commonly known as the short-armed euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact, multi-stemmed growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and unique, architectural appearance."
