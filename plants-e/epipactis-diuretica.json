    "intro": "Epipactis diuretica, commonly known as the diuretic helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Epipactis diuretica is noted for its medicinal properties, particularly its diuretic effects, which have been traditionally used in herbal medicine."
