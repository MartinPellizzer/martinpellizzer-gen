    "intro": "Erica leiophylla, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Erica leiophylla thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
