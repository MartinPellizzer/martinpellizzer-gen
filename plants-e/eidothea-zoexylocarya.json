    "intro": "Eidothea zoexylocarya, commonly known as the giant panda tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is a member of the Eucalyptus family and is notable for its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists. Its botanical study provides insights into evolutionary adaptations in high-altitude environments."
