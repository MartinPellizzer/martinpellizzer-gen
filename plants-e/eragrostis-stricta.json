It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Eragrostis stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
