    "intro": "Equisetum pratense f. pyramidale, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scouring rush, is a fern-like plant characterized by its slender, unbranched stems and whorls of small, needle-like leaves. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has sterile and fertile stems that produce spores. It is a relic from the Carboniferous period and exhibits primitive features such as vascular tissue and a lack of true roots. This form is distinguished by its more compact, pyramidal growth habit compared to the typical form of Equisetum pratense."
