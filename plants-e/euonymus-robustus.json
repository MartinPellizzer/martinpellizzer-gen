    "intro": "Euonymus robustus, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that persist into the winter. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. Euonymus robustus is also valued for its use in landscaping and as a hedge plant."
