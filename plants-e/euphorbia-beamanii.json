    "intro": "Euphorbia beamanii, commonly known as the Beaman's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
