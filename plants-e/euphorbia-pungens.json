    "intro": "Euphorbia pungens, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in sharp, spiny structures that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Euphorbia pungens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
