    "intro": "Elymus ciliaris var. hirtiflorus, commonly known as hairy-flowered beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, hairy inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as grasslands and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
