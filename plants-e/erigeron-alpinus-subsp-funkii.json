    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus subsp. funkii, commonly known as the alpine fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments."
