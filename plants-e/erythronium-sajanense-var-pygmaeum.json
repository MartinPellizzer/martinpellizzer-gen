    "intro": "Erythronium sajanense var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its small, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
