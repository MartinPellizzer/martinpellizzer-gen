    "intro": "Echium vulcanorum, commonly known as the Vulcan's thistle, is a striking plant native to the volcanic soils of the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Boraginaceae family, known for its medicinal and ornamental value. Its unique morphology adapts to the harsh, nutrient-poor conditions of volcanic environments. Echium vulcanorum is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
