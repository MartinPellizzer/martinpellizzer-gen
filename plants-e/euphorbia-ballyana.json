    "intro": "Euphorbia ballyana, commonly known as the Ballyana spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, spiny stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy resin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and alternate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Euphorbia ballyana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
