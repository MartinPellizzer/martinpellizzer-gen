    "intro": "Eucalyptus polybractea subsp. subcerea, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey to white bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, silky white pubescence, which contributes to its common name. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, typically in spring. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands."
