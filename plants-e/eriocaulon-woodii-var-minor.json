    "intro": "Eriocaulon woodii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf marsh grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
