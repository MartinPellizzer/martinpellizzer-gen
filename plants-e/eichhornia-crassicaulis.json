    "intro": "Eichhornia crassicaulis, commonly known as water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has dark green, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with each leaf measuring up to 20 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a white or purple spathe. It spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it an invasive species in many waterways. Due to its high growth rate, it can clog waterways and reduce oxygen levels in aquatic ecosystems."
