    "intro": "Elettariopsis unifolia, commonly known as the single-leaved elettariopsis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pinkish to white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
