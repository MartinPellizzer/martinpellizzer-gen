    "intro": "Euphorbia atlantis var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the Whiteleaf Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with fleshy, pale green to white leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a prized addition to collections of succulent plants."
