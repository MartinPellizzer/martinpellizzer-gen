    "intro": "Ekebergia holtzii, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and striking, bright red flowers that appear in clusters during the dry season. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feathery leaflets, giving the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in savannas and woodland areas. The tree is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
