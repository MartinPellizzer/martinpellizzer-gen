    "intro": "Elasmatium, commonly known as the fairy moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Elatinaceae. These small, leafy plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Elasmatium species are characterized by their delicate, thread-like stems and small, closely packed leaves. They play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their habitats. Due to their specialized needs, they are often used in horticultural settings to create intricate, miniature landscapes."
