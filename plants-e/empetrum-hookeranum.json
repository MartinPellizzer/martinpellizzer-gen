    "intro": "Empetrum hookeranum, commonly known as the snowberry or dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant thrives in harsh environments, often found on rocky slopes and heaths where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and closely spaced, providing insulation against cold temperatures. Empetrum hookeranum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its extreme habitat."
