    "intro": "Echeveria rubens, commonly known as the red-leaf echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially under bright light. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Echeveria rubens is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
