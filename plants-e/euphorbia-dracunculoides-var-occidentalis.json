    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western spineless euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
