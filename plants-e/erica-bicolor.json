It is native to South Africa, where it typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or white, with a distinctive two-toned appearance. Erica bicolor is evergreen, with leathery, needle-like leaves that help it conserve water. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained, acidic conditions."
