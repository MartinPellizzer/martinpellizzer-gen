    "intro": "Euphorbia besseri, commonly known as the Bessera euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Euphorbia besseri is valued for its resilience and unique appearance in horticulture."
