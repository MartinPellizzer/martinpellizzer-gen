    "intro": "Eliokarmos rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
