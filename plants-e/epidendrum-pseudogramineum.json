    "intro": "Epidendrum pseudogramineum, commonly known as the grass-like orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural collections."
