    "intro": "Euphorbia fusiformis var. khandallensis, commonly known as the Khandallensis spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India. It features a cylindrical, stem-like structure that is typically green or reddish in color, with a thick, fleshy texture adapted to store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its unique morphology and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping."
