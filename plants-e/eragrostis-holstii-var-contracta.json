    "intro": "Eragrostis holstii var. contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid or semi-arid regions."
