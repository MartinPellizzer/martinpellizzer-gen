    "intro": "Epidendrum evectum, commonly known as the Mexican flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that often display shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in arid environments. Epidendrum evectum thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright but indirect light."
