    "intro": "Euchilus spinulosus, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in small, sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Euchilus spinulosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
