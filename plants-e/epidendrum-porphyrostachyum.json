    "intro": "Epidendrum porphyrostachyum, commonly known as the Purple-stem Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking purple stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
