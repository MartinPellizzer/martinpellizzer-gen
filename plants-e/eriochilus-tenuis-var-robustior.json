It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping."
