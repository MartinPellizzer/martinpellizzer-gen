    "intro": "Epilobium clavatum, commonly known as the clustered willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features upright stems that are often reddish or purple in color, and it produces showy, pink to purple flowers in the summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system. Epilobium clavatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
