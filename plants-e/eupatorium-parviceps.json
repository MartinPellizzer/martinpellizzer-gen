    "intro": "Eupatorium parviceps, commonly known as slender boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its slender stems and small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
