    "intro": "Epidendrum tricarinatum, commonly known as the three-ribbed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers with three prominent longitudinal ridges on the petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum tricarinatum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
