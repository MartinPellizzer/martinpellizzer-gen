    "intro": "Euphorbia paniculata subsp. welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's spurge, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellowish-green flowers that appear in terminal panicles. The plant produces a milky latex when cut, a common feature among the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires careful handling due to its toxic sap."
