It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
