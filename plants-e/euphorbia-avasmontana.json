    "intro": "Euphorbia avasmontana, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a branched stem covered in soft, woolly hair, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia avasmontana is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
