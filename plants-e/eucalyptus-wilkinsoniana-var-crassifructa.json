    "intro": "Eucalyptus wilkinsoniana var. crassifructa, commonly known as the broad-fruited mallees, is a variant of the eucalyptus species native to western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to grey pubescence. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, followed by woody, broad, oval-shaped capsules as its fruit. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub or small tree that thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
