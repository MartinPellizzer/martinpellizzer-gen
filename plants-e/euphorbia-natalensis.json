    "intro": "Euphorbia natalensis, commonly known as Natal spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with a distinctive greenish-gray bark and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has lobed, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
