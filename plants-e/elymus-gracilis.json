    "intro": "Elymus gracilis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in restoration ecology. Elymus gracilis is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
