It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers have a distinctive structure with a spurred lip and are often pollinated by flies and bees. This variety is distinguished by its interrupted leaf patterns and is sometimes considered a hybrid form of Epipactis latifolia."
