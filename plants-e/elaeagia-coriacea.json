    "intro": "Elaeagia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved elaeagia, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Elaeagia coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
