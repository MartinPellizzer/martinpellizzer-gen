    "intro": "Epidendrum platyotis, commonly known as the flat-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum platyotis is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
