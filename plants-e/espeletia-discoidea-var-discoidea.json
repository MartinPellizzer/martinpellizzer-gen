    "intro": "Espeletia discoidea var. discoidea, commonly known as the \"Cerro de la Muerte\" or \"Death Mountain\" plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking, showy flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Espeletia discoidea var. discoidea is adapted to cold, moist conditions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
