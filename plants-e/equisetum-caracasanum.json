    "intro": "Equisetum caracasanum, commonly known as the Carpathian horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and a lack of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing strobili, or cones, at the tips of its branches, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its fossil record suggests it has existed for millions of years, making it one of the oldest living plant lineages."
