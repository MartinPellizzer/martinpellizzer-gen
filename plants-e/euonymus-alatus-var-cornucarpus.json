    "intro": "Euonymus alatus var. cornucarpus, commonly known as the burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking orange-red foliage in the fall, which gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are usually dark green in summer. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the fruit is distinctive, consisting of a four-lobed, inflated capsule that splits open to reveal bright red seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
