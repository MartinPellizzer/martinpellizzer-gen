    "intro": "Echinocactus lutens, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, spiny shape and a dense covering of light-colored spines. The plant has a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in arid environments.

Echinocactus lutens is a slow-growing cactus that requires minimal water and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
