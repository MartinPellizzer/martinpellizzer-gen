    "intro": "Exohebea parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf hebe, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, drought-tolerant plants."
