    "intro": "Erica pubescens var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the autumn and winter seasons. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
