    "intro": "Euphorbia luteola, commonly known as the yellow-spined spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a distinctive, spiny stem and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia. The plant has milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Euphorbia luteola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
