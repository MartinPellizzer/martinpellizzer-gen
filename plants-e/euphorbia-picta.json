    "intro": "Euphorbia picta, commonly known as the painted spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which give it its striking appearance. Its leaves are usually green with white or yellow markings, adding to its ornamental value. Euphorbia picta is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
