    "intro": "Euphorbia rockii var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a tropical appearance. The plant produces bright yellow-orange cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the genus Euphorbia. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dramatic foliage and showy blooms. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care."
