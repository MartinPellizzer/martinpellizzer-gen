    "intro": "Echinoglochin eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's spurge, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Australia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, small, yellowish flowers clustered in complex inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
