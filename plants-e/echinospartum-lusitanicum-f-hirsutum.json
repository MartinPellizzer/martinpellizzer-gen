    "intro": "Echinospartum lusitanicum f. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy echinospartum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its hairy texture is a distinguishing feature, providing it with some degree of drought resistance. It is often found in Mediterranean shrublands and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
