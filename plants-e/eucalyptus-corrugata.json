    "intro": "Eucalyptus corrugata, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands."
