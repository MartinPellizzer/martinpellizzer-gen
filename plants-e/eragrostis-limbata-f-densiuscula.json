    "intro": "Eragrostis limbata f. densiuscula, commonly known as the dense-stemmed lovegrass, is a compact, tufted perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. This form is a natural variant of Eragrostis limbata, distinguished by its more dense foliage and shorter stature."
