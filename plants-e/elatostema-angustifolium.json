    "intro": "Elatostema angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. Elatostema angustifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady gardens."
