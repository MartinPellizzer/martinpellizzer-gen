    "intro": "Eugenia roseopetiolata, commonly known as the pink-veined eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive pink veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
