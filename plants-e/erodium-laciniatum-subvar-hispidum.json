    "intro": "Erodium laciniatum subvar. hispidum, commonly known as hairy erodium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called legumes, which contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature of this subspecies."
