It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that are elongated and contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
