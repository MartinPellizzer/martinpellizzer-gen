    "intro": "Euphorbia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angle spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive four-sided stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a spiny, woody structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate drought. Euphorbia tetragona is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
