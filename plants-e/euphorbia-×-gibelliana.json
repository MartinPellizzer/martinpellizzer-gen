    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 gibelliana, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which are adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts, making it visually striking. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
