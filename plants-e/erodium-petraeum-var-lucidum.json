    "intro": "Erodium petraeum var. lucidum, commonly known as the glossy bedstraw, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are typically hairy and alternate along the stems. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a short life cycle, completing its growth from germination to seed production within a single growing season."
