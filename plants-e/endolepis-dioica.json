    "intro": "Endolepis dioica, commonly known as the two-flowered grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same individual, though they are often found on separate plants. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Endolepis dioica typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
