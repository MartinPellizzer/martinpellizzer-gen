    "intro": "Euphorbia caput-aureum, commonly known as the golden crown or crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces striking yellow-orange cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences that resemble small crowns. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia caput-aureum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight."
