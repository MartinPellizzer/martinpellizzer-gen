    "intro": "Epimedium macranthum var. thunbergianum, commonly known as the Japanese barberry, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features leathery, dark green leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
