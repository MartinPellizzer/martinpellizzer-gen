    "intro": "Eurybia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky eryngo, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often surrounded by white or pale blue ray florets. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a sticky texture, which gives the plant its common name. Eurybia glutinosa is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
