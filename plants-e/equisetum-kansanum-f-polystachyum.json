    "intro": "Equisetum kansanum f. polystachyum, commonly known as the tall branch fern, is a variant of the scaly horse-tail plant. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a trait common among primitive vascular plants. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
