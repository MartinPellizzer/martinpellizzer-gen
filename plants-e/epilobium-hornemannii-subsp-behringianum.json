    "intro": "Epilobium hornemannii subsp. behringianum, commonly known as the Beringian willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra, wet meadows, and riverbanks. The plant features erect, often branched stems that are covered with short, glandular hairs. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, with pink to reddish-purple petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
