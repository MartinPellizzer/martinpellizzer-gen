    "intro": "Erica polyantha, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, depending on the variety. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica polyantha is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
