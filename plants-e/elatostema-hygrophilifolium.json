    "intro": "Elatostema hygrophilifolium, commonly known as the water-loving elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows close to the ground, with small, clustered leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, usually green or white, and it reproduces through both sexual and vegetative means. Elatostema hygrophilifolium plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
