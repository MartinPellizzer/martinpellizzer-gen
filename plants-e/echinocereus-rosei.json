    "intro": "Echinocereus rosei, commonly known as the rose window cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, giving it a unique and striking appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. It is a drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
