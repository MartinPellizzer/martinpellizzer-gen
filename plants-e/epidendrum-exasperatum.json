    "intro": "Epidendrum exasperatum, commonly known as the Spiny Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and striking, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they can grow on other plants without parasitizing them. Epidendrum exasperatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
