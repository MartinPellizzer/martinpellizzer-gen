    "intro": "Epidendrum filiforme, commonly known as the thread-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble threads, hence its common name. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Epidendrum filiforme is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
