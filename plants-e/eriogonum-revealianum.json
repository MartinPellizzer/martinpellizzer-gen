    "intro": "Eriogonum revealianum, commonly known as the Reveille's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and canyon walls. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum revealianum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in native plant gardens."
