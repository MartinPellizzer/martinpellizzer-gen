    "intro": "Erythraea centaurium var. acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered red centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers with prominent yellow spots. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. This variety is distinguished by its acute, sharply pointed flower petals, which give it its common name."
