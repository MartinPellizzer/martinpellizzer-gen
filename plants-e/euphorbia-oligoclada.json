    "intro": "Euphorbia oligoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features upright, branched stems that are often spiny and covered in a waxy cuticle. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
