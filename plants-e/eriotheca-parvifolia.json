    "intro": "Eriotheca parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved eriotheca, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriotheca parvifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
