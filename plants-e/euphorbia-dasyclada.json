    "intro": "Euphorbia dasyclada, commonly known as the coral tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching, woody stems that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia dasyclada is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
