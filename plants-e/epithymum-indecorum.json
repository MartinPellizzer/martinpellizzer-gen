It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of yellow and green. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures."
