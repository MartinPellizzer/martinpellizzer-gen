    "intro": "Eriosema pycnanthum, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
