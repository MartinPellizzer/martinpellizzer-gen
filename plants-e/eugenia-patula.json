    "intro": "Eugenia patula, commonly known as the small-leaved guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit yield. Eugenia patula is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
