    "intro": "Eriogonum strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Eriogonum strictum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
