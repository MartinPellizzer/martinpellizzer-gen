    "intro": "Enterosora barbatula, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted in the substrate. Enterosora barbatula is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
