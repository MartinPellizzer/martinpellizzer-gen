    "intro": "Eleocharis \u00d7 inaequilatera, commonly known as the variable spike-rush, is a hybrid grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescences composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the inflorescences often bear both male and female flowers, which is a feature of its reproductive biology. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
