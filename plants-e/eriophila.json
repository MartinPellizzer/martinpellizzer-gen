    "intro": "Eriophila, commonly known as beach grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Eriophila species are often used for dune stabilization due to their extensive root systems. Their ecological importance lies in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
