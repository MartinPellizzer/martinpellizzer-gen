    "intro": "Eupatorium nepalense, commonly known as Nepal boneset, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in forested regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough, hairy texture, while its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Eupatorium nepalense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
