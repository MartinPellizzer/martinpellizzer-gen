It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to wetland environments, it thrives in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
