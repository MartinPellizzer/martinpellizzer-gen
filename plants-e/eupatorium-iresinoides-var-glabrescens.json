    "intro": "Eupatorium iresinoides var. glabrescens, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a tall, branched stem. Its scientific name reflects its similarity to other Eupatorium species, while the varietal name \"glabrescens\" refers to its relatively smooth, hairless appearance. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
