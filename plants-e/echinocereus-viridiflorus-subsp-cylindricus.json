    "intro": "Echinocereus viridiflorus subsp. cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical green-flowered cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
