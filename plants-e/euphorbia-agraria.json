    "intro": "Euphorbia agraria, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, green stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is highly drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Euphorbia agraria is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
