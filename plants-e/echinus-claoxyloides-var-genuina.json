    "intro": "Echinus claoxyloides var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved echinus, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a woody stem with rough, bark-like texture and small, spiny structures along the leaf margins. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
