It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white to pale purple flowers. Its aromatic foliage releases a sweet, vanilla-like scent when crushed, which is a notable characteristic. It is often used in herbal medicine for its purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
