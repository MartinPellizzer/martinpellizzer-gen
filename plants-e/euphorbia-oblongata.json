    "intro": "Euphorbia oblongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation or study."
