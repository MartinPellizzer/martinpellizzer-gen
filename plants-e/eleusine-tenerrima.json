It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Eleusine tenerrima is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
