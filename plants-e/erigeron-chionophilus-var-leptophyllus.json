    "intro": "Erigeron chionophilus var. leptophyllus, commonly known as the snow-veined fleabane, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is valued in both native plant gardens and conservation efforts."
