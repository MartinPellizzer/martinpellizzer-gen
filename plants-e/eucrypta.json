    "intro": "Eucrypta, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and alternate leaves. Eucrypta species are native to parts of Africa and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often followed by capsules containing seeds."
