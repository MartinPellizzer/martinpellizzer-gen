    "intro": "Euphorbia dubia, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a succulent shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which give it its distinctive appearance. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia dubia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and resilience."
