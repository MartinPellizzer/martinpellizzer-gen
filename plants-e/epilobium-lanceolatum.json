    "intro": "Epilobium lanceolatum, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, riverbanks, and marshy areas. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and the stems are erect with a reddish hue. Epilobium lanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
