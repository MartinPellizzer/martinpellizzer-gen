It consists of a single species, Endodesmia nodiflora, which is native to the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical features include a short, stout stem and a lack of true leaves above the base. Endodesmia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
