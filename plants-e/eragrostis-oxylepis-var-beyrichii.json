It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense tufts and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
