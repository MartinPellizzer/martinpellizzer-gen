    "intro": "Ericoides lanatum, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Ericoides lanatum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
