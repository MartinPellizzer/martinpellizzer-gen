    "intro": "Eriachne aurea, commonly known as golden eriochloa, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale to golden flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Eriachne aurea is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
