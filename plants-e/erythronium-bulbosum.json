    "intro": "Erythronium bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous dog's tooth violet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its bulbous underground storage structures, which help it survive in its alpine habitat. The plant produces showy, nodding flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with three petals and three sepals. Its foliage consists of basal, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Erythronium bulbosum is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forested slopes at high elevations."
