    "intro": "Eucalyptus annettae, commonly known as the Annetta's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that displays a range of colors, from white to pink and red. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically grey-green in color, with a leathery texture. It produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. This species is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
