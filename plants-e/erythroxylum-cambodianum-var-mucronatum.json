    "intro": "Erythroxylum cambodianum var. mucronatum, commonly known as Cambodian coca, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia and Thailand. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is notable for its potential use in traditional medicine and its genetic relation to coca species, though it is not typically used for cocaine production."
