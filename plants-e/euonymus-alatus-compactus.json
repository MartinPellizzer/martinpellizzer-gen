It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that attract birds. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This species is valued for its hardiness and adaptability in both landscape design and as a container plant."
