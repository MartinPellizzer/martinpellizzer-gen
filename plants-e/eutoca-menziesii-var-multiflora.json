It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces male and female cones, with the female cones developing into seed-bearing structures that release winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high elevation forests. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some resistance to pests and diseases."
