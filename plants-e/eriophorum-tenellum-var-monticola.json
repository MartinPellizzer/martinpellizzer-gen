    "intro": "Eriophorum tenellum var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain cotton grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fluffy white flowers that resemble cotton, which are borne on slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces achenes (small, dry fruits) that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
