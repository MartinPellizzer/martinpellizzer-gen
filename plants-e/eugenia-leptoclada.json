    "intro": "Eugenia leptoclada, commonly known as the slender-leaved eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical gardens."
