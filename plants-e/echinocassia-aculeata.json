    "intro": "Echinocassia aculeata, commonly known as the spiny cassia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and prominent spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in follicles that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Echinocassia aculeata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures for medicinal purposes."
