It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. This plant thrives in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. It is drought-tolerant and can withstand salt spray, making it well-adapted to harsh coastal environments. Its growth habit and ecological importance make it an important species for coastal restoration projects."
