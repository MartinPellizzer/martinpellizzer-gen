    "intro": "Euphorbia flagelliformis, commonly known as the whipstick euphorbia, is a spiny, succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It features a thick, branching stem covered in sharp, needle-like spines that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments. Euphorbia flagelliformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
