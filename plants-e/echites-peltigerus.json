    "intro": "Echites peltigerus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas."
