    "intro": "Epidendrum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its flowers come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and red, and often have a fringed appearance along the edges of the petals. Epidendrum fimbriatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
