    "intro": "Eulophia explanata, commonly known as the broad-leafed eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the surrounding soil. Eulophia explanata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
