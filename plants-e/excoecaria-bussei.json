    "intro": "Excoecaria bussei, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or degraded areas."
