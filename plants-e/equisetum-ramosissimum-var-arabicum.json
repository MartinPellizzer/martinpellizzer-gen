    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. arabicum, commonly known as the Arab horsehair fern, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features whorls of small, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era. This species is notable for its lack of true leaves and its unique reproductive structures."
