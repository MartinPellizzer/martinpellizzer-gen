    "intro": "Erica maculosa, commonly known as the spotted heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in spring and summer. Erica maculosa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
