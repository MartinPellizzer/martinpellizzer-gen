    "intro": "Erica nivalis, commonly known as the snow heath, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a low-growing shrub with small, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Erica nivalis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
