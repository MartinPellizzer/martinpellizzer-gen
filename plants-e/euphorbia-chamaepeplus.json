    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaepeplus, commonly known as the cushion euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in Mediterranean climates."
