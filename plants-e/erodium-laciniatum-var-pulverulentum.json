    "intro": "Erodium laciniatum var. pulverulentum, commonly known as the powdered erodium, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, delicate leaves that are finely divided and covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally grown in horticulture."
