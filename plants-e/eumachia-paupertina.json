    "intro": "Eumachia paupertina, commonly known as the poor man's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. The plant features a slender stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its flowering period usually occurs during the wet season, and it is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
