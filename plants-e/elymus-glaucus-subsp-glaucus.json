    "intro": "Elymus glaucus subsp. glaucus, commonly known as bluegrass or wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense, compact clusters, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
