    "intro": "Euphorbia colliculina, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Euphorbia colliculina is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
