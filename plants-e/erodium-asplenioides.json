    "intro": "Erodium asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bedstraw, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are pink or white, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
