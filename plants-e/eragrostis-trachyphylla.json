    "intro": "Eragrostis trachyphylla, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with stiff, rough-textured leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Eragrostis trachyphylla is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
