    "intro": "Everistia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Everistia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates. They produce showy, often yellow or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's fibrous roots and robust growth make it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
