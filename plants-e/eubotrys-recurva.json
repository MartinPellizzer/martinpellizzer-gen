    "intro": "Eubotrys recurva, commonly known as the zigzag vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that often exhibit a zigzag pattern, which aids in its climbing habit. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin. Eubotrys recurva is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though its botanical study remains limited."
