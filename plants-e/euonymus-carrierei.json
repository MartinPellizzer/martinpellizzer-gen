    "intro": "Euonymus carrierei, commonly known as the Carri\u00e8re's spindle-tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its seasonal color changes. Euonymus carrierei is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
