    "intro": "Electra mutica var. subvillosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinctive yellow or green throat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
