    "intro": "Euonymus rosmarinifolius, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, glossy dark green foliage with a leathery texture, and its leaves are often aromatic, reminiscent of rosemary. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Euonymus rosmarinifolius is often used in ground cover and as a decorative plant in shaded or partially sunny environments."
