    "intro": "Echinopsis grandiflora, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and yellow. Its thick, waxy skin helps it retain moisture in harsh desert conditions. Echinopsis grandiflora is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
