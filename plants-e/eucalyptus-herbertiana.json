    "intro": "Eucalyptus herbertiana, commonly known as Herbert's malleable, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled grey and white underlayer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a white underside. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from pale yellow to cream, typically blooming in spring. The plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
