    "intro": "Eucalyptus exserta var. parvula, commonly known as the small-leaved malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee and dry forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
