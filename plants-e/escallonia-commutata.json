    "intro": "Escallonia commutata, commonly known as the Chilean firebush, is a flowering shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has elliptical leaves with serrated edges and produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Escallonia commutata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
