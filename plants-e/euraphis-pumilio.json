    "intro": "Euraphis pumilio, commonly known as the peach-potato aphid, is a small, soft-bodied insect that feeds on the sap of plants. It belongs to the family Aphididae and is known for its ability to colonize a wide range of host plants, including potatoes, peaches, and various ornamental plants. The aphid's body is typically pale green, and it has long, slender legs and antennae. It reproduces rapidly, often giving birth to live young, and can cause significant damage to crops by transmitting viruses. Its presence is often indicated by the formation of honeydew on plant surfaces, which can lead to the growth of sooty mold."
