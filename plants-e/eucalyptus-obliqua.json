    "intro": "Eucalyptus obliqua, commonly known as the messmate, is a tall, evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels off in long strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The tree produces small, globular flowers that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus obliqua is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in forests and woodlands. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, have been used for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
