    "intro": "Euphorbia fodhliana, commonly known as the Socotra candelabra, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive branching structure, resembling a candlestick, with multiple stems growing from a single base. The plant features small, green, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia fodhliana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions."
