It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are similar to those of the a\u00e7a\u00ed palm. Euterpe longibracteata is valued for its ecological role and has potential for sustainable use in local communities."
