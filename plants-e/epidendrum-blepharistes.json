    "intro": "Epidendrum blepharistes, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often adorned with numerous showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in moisture retention. This species is well-suited for hanging baskets or as a climbing plant in greenhouses due to its vigorous growth habit."
