    "intro": "Elytrigia pulcherrima var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
