    "intro": "Erica maritima, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along the seashore. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the spring. Erica maritima is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its evergreen leaves are narrow and leathery, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
