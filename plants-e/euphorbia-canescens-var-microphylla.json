    "intro": "Euphorbia canescens var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a woody stem covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils."
