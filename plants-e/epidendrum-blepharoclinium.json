It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and distinctive lemon-like fragrance."
