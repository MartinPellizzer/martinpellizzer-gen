    "intro": "Endiandra archboldiana, commonly known as the Archbold's endiandra, is a rare tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family, which includes many valuable hardwood species. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, typically appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
