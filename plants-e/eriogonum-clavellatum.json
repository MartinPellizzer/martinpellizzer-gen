    "intro": "Eriogonum clavellatum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum clavellatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
