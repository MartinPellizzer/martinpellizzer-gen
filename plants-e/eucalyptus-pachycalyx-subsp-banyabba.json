It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green color with a dense coating of hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and are produced in spring. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
