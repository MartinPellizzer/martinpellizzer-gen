    "intro": "Eriosyce sandillon var. mollesensis, commonly known as the soft sandhill cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stem, which is typically covered in dense, white to grayish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
