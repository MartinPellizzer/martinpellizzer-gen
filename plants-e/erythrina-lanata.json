    "intro": "Erythrina lanata, commonly known as the woolly coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has compound leaves composed of several pairs of elliptical, hairy leaflets, which give it its common name. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it produces long, slender pods that contain flat, seed-filled chambers. Erythrina lanata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
