    "intro": "Escobariopsis sphacelata, commonly known as the rock spiky scale, is a small, mat-forming lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth pattern. The thallus is typically dark green to blackish in color, with a granular texture that helps it adhere to substrates. It produces spores in small, flask-shaped apothecia, which are often covered in tiny, spiny structures. This lichen is often found on bare rock surfaces and is adapted to withstand extreme environmental conditions."
