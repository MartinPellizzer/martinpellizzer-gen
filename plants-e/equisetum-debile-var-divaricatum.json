    "intro": "Equisetum debile var. divaricatum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found in the upper portions of the stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Its slender, jointed stems and reduced leaves make it easily identifiable within the horsetail genus."
