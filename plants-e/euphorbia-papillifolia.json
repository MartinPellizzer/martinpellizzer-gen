    "intro": "Euphorbia papillifolia, commonly known as the papillate spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or papillae. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy tissues. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
