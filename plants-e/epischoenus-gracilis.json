    "intro": "Epischoenus gracilis, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairless and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its narrow leaves are arranged in a whorled pattern, and it produces small, greenish flowers in late summer. Epischoenus gracilis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
