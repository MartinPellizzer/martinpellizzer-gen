    "intro": "Elaphoglossum dutrae, commonly known as the Dutra's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, Elaphoglossum dutrae is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, moist environments within tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
