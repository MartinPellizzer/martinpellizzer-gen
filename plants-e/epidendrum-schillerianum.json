    "intro": "Epidendrum schillerianum, commonly known as the Schiller's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically has strap-like leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum schillerianum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
