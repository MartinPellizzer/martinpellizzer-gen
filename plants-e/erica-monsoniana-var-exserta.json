    "intro": "Erica monsoniana var. exserta, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. It produces small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh maritime climates."
