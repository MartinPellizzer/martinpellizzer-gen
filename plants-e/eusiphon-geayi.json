    "intro": "Eusiphon geayi, commonly known as the Yucatan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in limestone-rich soils. It has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Eusiphon geayi is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
