    "intro": "Echinopsis aurea var. tortuosa, commonly known as the spiral hedgehog cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, yellow spines arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
