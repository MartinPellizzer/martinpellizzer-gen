    "intro": "Euonymus prismatomerioides, commonly known as the Chinese burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features striking orange-red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the fruit is a four-lobed capsule that turns red when mature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance."
