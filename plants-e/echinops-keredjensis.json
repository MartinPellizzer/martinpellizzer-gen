It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads of white or yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a compact growth habit. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echinops keredjensis is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
