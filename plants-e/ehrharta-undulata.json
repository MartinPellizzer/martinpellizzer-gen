    "intro": "Ehrharta undulata, commonly known as woolly fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Ehrharta undulata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
