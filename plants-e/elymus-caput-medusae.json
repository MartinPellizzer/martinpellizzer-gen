    "intro": "Elymus caput-medusae, commonly known as the \"Medusa's Head\" grass, is a tall perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and large, spike-like inflorescences that resemble a crown of spikes. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in dense clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Elymus caput-medusae is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
