    "intro": "Ephedra gerardiana var. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim ephedra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ephedraceae. It is native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. This species has been historically used in traditional medicine for its stimulant properties, though its use is now regulated due to its potential for abuse."
