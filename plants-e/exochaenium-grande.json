    "intro": "Exochaenium grande, commonly known as the large flat grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
