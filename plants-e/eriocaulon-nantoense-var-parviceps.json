It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly found in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a dense covering of fine hairs. This variant is notable for its adaptation to waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
