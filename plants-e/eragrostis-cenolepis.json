It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in areas with moderate to low rainfall. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
