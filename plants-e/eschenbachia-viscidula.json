    "intro": "Eschenbachia viscidula, commonly known as the stickyleaf plant, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow or white. Eschenbachia viscidula is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
