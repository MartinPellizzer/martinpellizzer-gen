It is characterized by its finely serrated, maple-like leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
