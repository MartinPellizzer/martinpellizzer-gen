    "intro": "Euphrasia maximowiczii var. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are opposite and linear, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its specific habitat preferences and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to alkaline conditions."
