    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum subsp. minus, commonly known as the small-flowered buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are characteristic of the genus Eriogonum. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
