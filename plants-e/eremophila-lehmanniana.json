    "intro": "Eremophila lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eremophila lehmanniana is well adapted to low rainfall and is often used in dryland landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
