    "intro": "Euonymus crinitus, commonly known as the curlyleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, wavy, and often curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Euonymus crinitus thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and its low maintenance requirements."
