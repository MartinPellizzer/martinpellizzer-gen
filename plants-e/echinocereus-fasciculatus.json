    "intro": "Echinocereus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, forming a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its thick, spiny stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Echinocereus fasciculatus is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
