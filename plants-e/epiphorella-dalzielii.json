    "intro": "Epiphorella dalzielii, commonly known as the Dalziel's epiphytic orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which helps it blend with its environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
