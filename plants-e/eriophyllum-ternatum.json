    "intro": "Eriophyllum ternatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 1 meter tall, with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Eriophyllum ternatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic value."
