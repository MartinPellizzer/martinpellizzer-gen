    "intro": "Erigeron asteroides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its daisy-like appearance, featuring blue to purple flower heads surrounded by white to grayish-blue ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a showy display of flowers from late summer into early fall. Erigeron asteroides is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and provide habitat for pollinators."
