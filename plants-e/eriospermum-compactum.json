    "intro": "Eriospermum compactum, commonly known as the dwarf eriosperm, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small, compact shrub that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces distinctive, woolly seed capsules that aid in seed dispersal. Eriospermum compactum is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
