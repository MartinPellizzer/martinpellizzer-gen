    "intro": "Euonymus perbellus, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage. However, it can be invasive in some regions, requiring careful management."
