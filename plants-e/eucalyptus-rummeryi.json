    "intro": "Eucalyptus rummeryi, commonly known as the Rummery's gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southeastern region of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that can range in color from grey to white. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a greyish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands."
