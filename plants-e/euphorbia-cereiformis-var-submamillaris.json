    "intro": "Euphorbia cereiformis var. submamillaris, commonly known as the wooly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
