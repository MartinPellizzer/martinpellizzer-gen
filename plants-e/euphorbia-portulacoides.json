    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides, commonly known as the \"Pincushion Spurge,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, spiny, globular stem that resembles a pincushion, often covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia portulacoides is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
