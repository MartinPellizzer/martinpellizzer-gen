    "intro": "Erica humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the summer months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica humbertii is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
