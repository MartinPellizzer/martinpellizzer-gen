    "intro": "Equisetum laevigatum f. ramosum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail characterized by its more branched stems. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, typically found in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features whorled leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures, with the main stem bearing nodes and branches. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are essential for reproduction. This fern-like plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
