    "intro": "Echites arboreus, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a woody plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Echites arboreus is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
