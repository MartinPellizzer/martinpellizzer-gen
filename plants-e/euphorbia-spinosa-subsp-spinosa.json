    "intro": "Euphorbia spinosa subsp. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, contributing to its overall spiny appearance. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy plant for dry climates."
