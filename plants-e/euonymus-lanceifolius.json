    "intro": "Euonymus lanceifolius, commonly known as the lanceleaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are usually 3 to 5 inches long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. Euonymus lanceifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. It is valued for its ornamental value and ability to provide food for wildlife."
