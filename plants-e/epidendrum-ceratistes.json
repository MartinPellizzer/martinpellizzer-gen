    "intro": "Epidendrum ceratistes, commonly known as the spike orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a pseudobulbous stem with long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and slightly corrugated. The plant produces striking inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
