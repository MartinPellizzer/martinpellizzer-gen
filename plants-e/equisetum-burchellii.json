    "intro": "Equisetum burchellii, commonly known as the African horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its tall, jointed stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in clusters. Equisetum burchellii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest surviving plant species."
