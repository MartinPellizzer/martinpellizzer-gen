    "intro": "Ehrharta trochera, commonly known as false brome, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Ehrharta trochera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
