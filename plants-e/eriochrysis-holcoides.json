    "intro": "Eriochrysis holcoides, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a small, perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces tiny, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and freshwater habitats. Eriochrysis holcoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
