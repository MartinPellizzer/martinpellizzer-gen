    "intro": "Eriogonum neglectum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert and coastal areas. Eriogonum neglectum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
