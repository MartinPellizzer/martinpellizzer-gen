    "intro": "Euphorbia acrurensis, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiky, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It produces a milky latex when damaged, which can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia acrurensis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
