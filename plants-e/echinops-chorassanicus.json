    "intro": "Echinops chorassanicus, commonly known as the Afghan thistle, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog, hence its genus name \"Echinops.\" The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowering period occurs in late summer, producing yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
