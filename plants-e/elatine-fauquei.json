It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Elatine fauquei produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in nutrient-rich waters. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in temporary water bodies, making it an indicator of stable aquatic habitats."
