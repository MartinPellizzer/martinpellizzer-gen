    "intro": "Epipactis cruenta, commonly known as the bloody orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, red-brown to purple flowers that resemble bloodstains, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late summer. Epipactis cruenta is a perennial herb that is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
