    "intro": "Epallage salviifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emit a mild minty scent when crushed. Epallage salviifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
