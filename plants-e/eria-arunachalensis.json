    "intro": "Eria arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh, India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria arunachalensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
