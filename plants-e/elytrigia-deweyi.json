    "intro": "Elytrigia deweyi, commonly known as Dewey's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
