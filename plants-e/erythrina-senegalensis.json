    "intro": "Erythrina senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegal flame tree, is a deciduous legume native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking red flowers and compound leaves, which are typical of the Erythrina genus. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
