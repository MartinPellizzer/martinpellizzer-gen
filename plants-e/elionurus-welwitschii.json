It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture. Elionurus welwitschii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions."
