    "intro": "Eria mollicaulis, commonly known as the soft-stemmed orchid, is a tropical plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in forest understories or on tree trunks in Southeast Asia. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Eria mollicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
