    "intro": "Elleanthus tillandsioides, commonly known as the silver torchstick, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical displays."
