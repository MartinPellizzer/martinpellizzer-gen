    "intro": "Echites spinosus, commonly known as the spiny echites, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
