    "intro": "Epidendrum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower epidendron, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence, which typically blooms in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum uniflorum is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
