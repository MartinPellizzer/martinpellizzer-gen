    "intro": "Ericoides propendens, commonly known as the leaning eric, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partially shaded environments. Its unique growth habit involves a tendency to lean or bend, which may be an adaptation to wind or soil conditions. Ericoides propendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
