    "intro": "Eucapnos eximius, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions and store water efficiently. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Eucapnos eximius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
