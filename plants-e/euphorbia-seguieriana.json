    "intro": "Euphorbia seguieriana, commonly known as the Seguier's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching stem covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments. Euphorbia seguieriana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
