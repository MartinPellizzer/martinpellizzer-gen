    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides var. flamandii, commonly known as the Flamand's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
