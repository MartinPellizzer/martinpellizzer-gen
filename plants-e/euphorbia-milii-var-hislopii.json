    "intro": "Euphorbia milii var. hislopii, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It features thick, spiny stems and leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true blooms. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its toxic sap can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it."
