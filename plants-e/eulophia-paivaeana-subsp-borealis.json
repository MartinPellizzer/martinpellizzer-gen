    "intro": "Eulophia paivaeana subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern eulophia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the northern regions of South America. This orchid is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. It produces racemes of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with showy, spurred petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
