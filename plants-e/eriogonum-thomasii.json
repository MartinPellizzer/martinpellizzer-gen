It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. It produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across arid environments. Eriogonum thomasii is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
