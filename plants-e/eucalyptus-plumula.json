    "intro": "Eucalyptus plumula, commonly known as the white mallet gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to greyish bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly rough texture. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
