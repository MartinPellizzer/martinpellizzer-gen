It belongs to the Onagraceae family, which includes willows and evening primroses. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
