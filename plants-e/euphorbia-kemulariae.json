    "intro": "Euphorbia kemulariae, commonly known as the Kemulariae spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive rosette of thick, fleshy, pale green leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Euphorbia kemulariae is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-draining soil and full sun exposure."
