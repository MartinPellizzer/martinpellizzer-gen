    "intro": "Elatostema janowskyi, commonly known as the small-leaved elatostema, is a member of the Urticaceae family, characterized by its small, often succulent leaves. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant typically grows as a low herb or shrub, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually opposite, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in inflorescences, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits."
