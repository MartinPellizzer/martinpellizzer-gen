It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments, showcasing its adaptability to arid conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
