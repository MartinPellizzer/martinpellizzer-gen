    "intro": "Eriophyllum brachylepis, commonly known as coastal goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small golden clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. Eriophyllum brachylepis is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
