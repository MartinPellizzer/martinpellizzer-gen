    "intro": "Erica \u00d7 debilis, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. It produces bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring. Erica \u00d7 debilis is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and preference for acidic soil."
