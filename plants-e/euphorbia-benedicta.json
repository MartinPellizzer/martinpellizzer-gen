    "intro": "Euphorbia benedicta, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem with spiny, fleshy leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation."
