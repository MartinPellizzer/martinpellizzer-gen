    "intro": "Elymus hispidus subsp. barbulatus, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, awn-tipped florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its common name, while its roots form a fibrous network that helps stabilize soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting wildlife and preventing erosion."
