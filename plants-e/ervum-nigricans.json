    "intro": "Ervum nigricans, commonly known as black vetch, is a leguminous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, dark purple to black pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in temperate climates. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Ervum nigricans is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
