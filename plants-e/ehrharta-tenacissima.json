    "intro": "Ehrharta tenacissima, commonly known as silky blue grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover."
