    "intro": "Elymus scaber var. plurinervis, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stiff, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system makes it highly resilient to drought and grazing, contributing to its ecological significance in grassland ecosystems. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
