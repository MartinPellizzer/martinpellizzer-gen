It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
