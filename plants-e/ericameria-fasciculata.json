    "intro": "Ericameria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered greasewood, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and saline areas. Ericameria fasciculata is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh landscapes."
