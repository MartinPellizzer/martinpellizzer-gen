It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as streambanks and canyon walls. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching.
