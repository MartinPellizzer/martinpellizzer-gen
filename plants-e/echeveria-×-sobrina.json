    "intro": "Echeveria \u00d7 sobrina, commonly known as the hybrid echeveria, is a succulent plant native to the United States, particularly in Texas. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a powdery coating called farina. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
