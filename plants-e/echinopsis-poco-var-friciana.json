    "intro": "Echinopsis poco var. friciana, commonly known as the Friciana moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, thick stem with a single, spiky, white or pale blue flower that blooms at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry environments. Its fleshy, water-storing stems help it endure long periods without rainfall. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit."
