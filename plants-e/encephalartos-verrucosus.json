    "intro": "Encephalartos verrucosus, commonly known as the serrated cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen cycad characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, dark green leaves. The plant produces a large, cone-like structure that contains both male and female flowers, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
