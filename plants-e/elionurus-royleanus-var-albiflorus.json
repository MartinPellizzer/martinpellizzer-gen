It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
