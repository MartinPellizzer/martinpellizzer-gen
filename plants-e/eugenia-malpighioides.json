    "intro": "Eugenia malpighioides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a noxious weed in several regions."
