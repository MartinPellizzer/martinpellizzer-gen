    "intro": "Erythrina leptorhiza, commonly known as the slender flame tree, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often woody with a reddish hue. Erythrina leptorhiza is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
