    "intro": "Euphorbia indica var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branching stems covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
