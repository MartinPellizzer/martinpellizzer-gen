    "intro": "Echidnopsis cereiformis, commonly known as the candleplant, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features a tall, candle-like stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered in dense, woolly white to greyish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers at the top of the stem, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, giving it a unique and rugged appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
