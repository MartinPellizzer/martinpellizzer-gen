It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Echinospermum filiforme is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has no significant commercial use but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
