    "intro": "Erepsia patula, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone habitats."
