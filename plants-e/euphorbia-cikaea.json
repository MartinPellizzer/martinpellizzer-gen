    "intro": "Euphorbia cikaea, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
