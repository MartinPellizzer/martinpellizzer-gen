    "intro": "Edraianthus serpyllifolius f. pilosulus, commonly known as the hairy thrift, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and grayish-green foliage covered in fine hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and naturalized areas."
