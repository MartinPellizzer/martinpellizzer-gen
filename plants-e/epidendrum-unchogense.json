    "intro": "Epidendrum unchogense, commonly known as the Peruvian Orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Epidendrum unchogense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
