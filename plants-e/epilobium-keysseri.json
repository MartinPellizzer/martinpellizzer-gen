It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, often at high elevations where conditions are harsh. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are pink to purple in color, with five petals, and appear in clusters during the summer months. Epilobium keysseri is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
