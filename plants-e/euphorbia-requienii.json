    "intro": "Euphorbia requienii, commonly known as the golden crown or crown of thorns, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It features a distinctive, spiny, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that emerge from a cup-like structure called a cyathium, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to propagate through both seeds and offsets. Euphorbia requienii is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
