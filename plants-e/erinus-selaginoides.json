    "intro": "Erinus selaginoides, commonly known as the silver leaf erinus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and profuse displays of small, tubular flowers. The foliage is notable for its silvery-gray appearance, which is due to dense pubescence covering the leaves. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions."
