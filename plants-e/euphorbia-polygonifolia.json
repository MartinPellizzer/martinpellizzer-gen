    "intro": "Euphorbia polygonifolia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically oval or rhomboidal and may have a waxy coating. Euphorbia polygonifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
