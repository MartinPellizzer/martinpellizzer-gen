    "intro": "Euphorbia larica, commonly known as the alpine spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
