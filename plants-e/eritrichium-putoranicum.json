    "intro": "Eritrichium putoranicum, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils and meadows at high elevations. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. Eritrichium putoranicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems of high-altitude habitats."
