    "intro": "Euphorbia marotsipoyana, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces a unique type of flower called a cyathium, which is surrounded by modified leaves known as bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
