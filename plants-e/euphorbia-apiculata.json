    "intro": "Euphorbia apiculata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems covered in small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia apiculata is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
