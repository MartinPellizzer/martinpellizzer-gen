    "intro": "Echeveria alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-blue with a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant."
