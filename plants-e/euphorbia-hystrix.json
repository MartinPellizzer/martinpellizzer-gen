    "intro": "Euphorbia hystrix, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, spiny, leafless stems that form a dense, thorn-covered structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia hystrix thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that requires minimal care once established."
