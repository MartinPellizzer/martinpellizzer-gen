    "intro": "Eranthemum pratense, commonly known as the meadow eranthemum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pink or violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Eranthemum pratense thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
