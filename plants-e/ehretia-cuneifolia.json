    "intro": "Ehretia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ehretia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Ehretia cuneifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
