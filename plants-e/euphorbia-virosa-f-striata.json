    "intro": "Euphorbia virosa f. striata, commonly known as the striped spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with distinctive yellowish-green, ribbed leaves that have a striking striped pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
