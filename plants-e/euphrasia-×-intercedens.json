    "intro": "Euphrasia \u00d7 intercedens, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a hybrid species within the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Euphrasia \u00d7 intercedens is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host plants while still performing photosynthesis."
