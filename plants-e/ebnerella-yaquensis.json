    "intro": "Ebnerella yaquensis, commonly known as the Yaquensis fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and wetlands, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its spores are dispersed through water, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The plant plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
