    "intro": "Echinops albidus, commonly known as the white thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that are covered in white bracts. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of its distinctive seed heads. Echinops albidus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
