    "intro": "Evia amara, commonly known as bitterleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, serrated leaves that contain a bitter compound. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, due to its strong bitterness, it is typically prepared with other ingredients to mitigate its taste."
