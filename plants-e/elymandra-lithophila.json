    "intro": "Elymandra lithophila, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native environment. Elymandra lithophila is well-suited to dry conditions and requires minimal water once established."
