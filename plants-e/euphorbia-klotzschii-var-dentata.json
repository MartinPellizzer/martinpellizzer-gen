    "intro": "Euphorbia klotzschii var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, and it thrives in arid conditions with minimal water requirements. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
