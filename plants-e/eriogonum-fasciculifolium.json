    "intro": "Eriogonum fasciculifolium, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion in its native habitat."
