    "intro": "Epidendrum megalobambusiforme, commonly known as the giant bamboo orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs and large, broad leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces showy, pendulous inflorescences with numerous flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and growth habit, it is a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor collections."
