    "intro": "Echeveria multicaulis, commonly known as the compact echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features a dense, rounded rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of pale purple flowers in the spring, adding ornamental value. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
