It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are small, round, and contain several seeds, typical of many Myrtaceae species. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
