    "intro": "Echinocereus orcuttii, commonly known as the Ortege's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that often branch out near the base. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
