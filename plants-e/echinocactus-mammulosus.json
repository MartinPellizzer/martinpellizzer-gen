    "intro": "Echinocactus mammulosus, commonly known as the woolly hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny, woolly covering that provides protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its stems are cylindrical and often branching, with a thick, fleshy structure that stores water. Echinocactus mammulosus produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior."
