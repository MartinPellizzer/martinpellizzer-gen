It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorls of small, needle-like leaves. This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, particularly in mountainous regions. It reproduces via spores and is typically found in moist, well-drained environments. Equisetum saxicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
