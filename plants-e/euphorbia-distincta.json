    "intro": "Euphorbia distincta, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often reduced to spines, aiding in water conservation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Euphorbia distincta is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements."
