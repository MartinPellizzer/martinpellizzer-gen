    "intro": "Eschatogramme furcata var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored goat's beard, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features distinctive, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a soft, silvery-white down. The plant produces tall, spikelike inflorescences that bear showy, pale pink to white flowers with prominent yellow stamens. Its botanical name reflects its branched (furcata) structure and the two-color (bicolor) variation in its flowers. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
