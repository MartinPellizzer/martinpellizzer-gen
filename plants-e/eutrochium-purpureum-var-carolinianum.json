It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Its showy, clustered purple-pink flowers bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees.
