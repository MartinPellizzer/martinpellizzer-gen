    "intro": "Epidendrum pruinosum, commonly known as the velvet epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate to high humidity. Epidendrum pruinosum is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
