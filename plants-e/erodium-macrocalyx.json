    "intro": "Erodium macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are characterized by their showy, spurred petals and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erodium macrocalyx is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
