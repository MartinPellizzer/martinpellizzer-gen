    "intro": "Eremopoa persica, commonly known as Persian sand grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Eremopoa persica is adapted to survive in sandy soils and is often found in dunes or rocky areas."
