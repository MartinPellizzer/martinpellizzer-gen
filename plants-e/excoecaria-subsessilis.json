    "intro": "Excoecaria subsessilis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes shorelines and prevents erosion. Excoecaria subsessilis plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and supporting biodiversity."
