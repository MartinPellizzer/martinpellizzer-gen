    "intro": "Epidendrum putumayoense, commonly known as the Putumayo orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America, particularly Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum putumayoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
