    "intro": "Enomegra bipinnatifida, commonly known as the double-pinnate fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate, feathery fronds. Its leaves are bipinnatifid, meaning they are divided into two sets of fine, thread-like segments, creating a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in humid, temperate climates. The structure of its fronds is adapted for efficient water retention and light absorption in its natural habitat."
