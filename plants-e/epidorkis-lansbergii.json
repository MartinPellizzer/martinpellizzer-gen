    "intro": "Epidorkis lansbergii, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Its fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with the upper portion being sterile and the lower portion bearing spore-producing structures. Epidorkis lansbergii plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
