    "intro": "Epithelantha pachyrhiza var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed sun cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of fleshy, spiny stems that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is prized for its unique morphology and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
