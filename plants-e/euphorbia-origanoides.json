    "intro": "Euphorbia origanoides, commonly known as the wooly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a distinctive appearance with its greyish-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
