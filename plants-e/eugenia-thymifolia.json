    "intro": "Eugenia thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved eugenia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, elliptical leaves that emit a subtle thyme-like scent. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by edible, fleshy berries. Eugenia thymifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ethnobotanical studies."
