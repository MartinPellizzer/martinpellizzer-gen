    "intro": "Elatostema tenompokense, commonly known as the small-leaved elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elatostemaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Elatostema tenompokense is often found growing in rocky soils or on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
