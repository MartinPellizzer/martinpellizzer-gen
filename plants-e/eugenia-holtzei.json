It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique flowering pattern, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
