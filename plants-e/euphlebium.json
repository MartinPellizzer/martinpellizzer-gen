    "intro": "Euphlebium, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Euphlebiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. Euphlebium species are often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where they contribute to aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. The genus is distinguished by its unique reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to their specialized habitats, Euphlebium plants are relatively rare and are of interest to botanists studying aquatic flora."
