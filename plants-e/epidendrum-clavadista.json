    "intro": "Epidendrum clavadista, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum clavadista thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
