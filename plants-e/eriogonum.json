    "intro": "Eriogonum, commonly known as goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to western North America, particularly in the western United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their spiny stems, palmate leaves, and showy, often yellow or white, flower clusters. Eriogonum species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, and many are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
