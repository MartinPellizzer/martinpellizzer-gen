    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis subsp. demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnat's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern France and northern Italy. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thin layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Euphorbia nicaeensis subsp. demnatensis is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
