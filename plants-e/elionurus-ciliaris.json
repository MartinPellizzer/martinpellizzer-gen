    "intro": "Elionurus ciliaris, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with fine, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elionurus ciliaris plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
