    "intro": "Epilobium schinzii, commonly known as Schinz's willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often glandular-dotted. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spikes, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Epilobium schinzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
