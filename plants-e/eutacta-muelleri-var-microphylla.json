    "intro": "Eutacta muelleri var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It features delicate, slender blades that form a dense, mat-like growth habit, often reaching only a few centimeters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its fine texture and ability to create a soft, flowing appearance in landscaping."
