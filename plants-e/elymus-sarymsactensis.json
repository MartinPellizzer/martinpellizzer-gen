It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
