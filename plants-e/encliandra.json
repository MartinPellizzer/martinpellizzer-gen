    "intro": "Encliandra, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their smooth, often silver- or gray-green leaves, which provide a striking visual contrast. Encliandra species typically have small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
