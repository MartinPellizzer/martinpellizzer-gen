    "intro": "Excoecaria biglandulosa var. sublanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-lanceleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
