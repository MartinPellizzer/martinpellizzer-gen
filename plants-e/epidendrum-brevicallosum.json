    "intro": "Epidendrum brevicallosum, commonly known as the short-stemmed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically has broad, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Epidendrum brevicallosum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright but indirect light."
