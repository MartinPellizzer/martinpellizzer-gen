    "intro": "Eryngium humile, commonly known as sea holly, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, surrounded by silver-green bracts. The plant has a compact, bushy habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Eryngium humile is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
