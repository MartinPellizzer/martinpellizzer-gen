    "intro": "Excoecaria himalayensis var. cuspidata, commonly known as the Himalayan croton, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often brightly colored and showy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
