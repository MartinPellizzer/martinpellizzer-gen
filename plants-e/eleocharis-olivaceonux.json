    "intro": "Eleocharis olivaceonux, commonly known as the olive-backed spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and tapering, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib. Eleocharis olivaceonux plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
