    "intro": "Echinocactus robustus, commonly known as the Mexican lion's claw, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has spiny, cylindrical stems that help it store water and reduce transpiration. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
