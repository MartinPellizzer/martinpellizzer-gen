    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. lautum, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
