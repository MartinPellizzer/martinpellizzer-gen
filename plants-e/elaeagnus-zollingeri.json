    "intro": "Elaeagnus zollingeri, commonly known as the silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery, hair-covered leaves and small, yellowish-green berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its fragrant flowers, which appear in early spring, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Elaeagnus zollingeri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
