    "intro": "Eulophia mannii, commonly known as the African orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowering structure. The plant produces racemose inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that often display a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, aiding in water retention in its natural habitat. Eulophia mannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in greenhouses and gardens for its unique floral display."
