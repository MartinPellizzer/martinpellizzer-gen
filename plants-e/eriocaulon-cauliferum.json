    "intro": "Eriocaulon cauliferum, commonly known as the mountain marsh grass, is a small perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its tiny, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spike-like clusters, and the plant produces small, three-lobed seeds. Eriocaulon cauliferum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments and for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
