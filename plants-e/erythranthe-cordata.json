    "intro": "Erythranthe cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its seed capsules release a sticky substance that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. Erythranthe cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
