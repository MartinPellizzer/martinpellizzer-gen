    "intro": "Epiphyllum trimetrale, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often used for propagation. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Despite its cactus classification, it lacks spines and has a soft, fleshy texture."
