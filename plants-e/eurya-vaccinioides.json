    "intro": "Eurya vaccinioides, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Eurya vaccinioides thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, hardy shrub."
