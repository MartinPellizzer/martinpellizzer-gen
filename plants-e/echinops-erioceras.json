    "intro": "Echinops erioceras, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical stem and dense, white to grayish-blue bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Echinops erioceras is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking visual appeal and hardy nature."
