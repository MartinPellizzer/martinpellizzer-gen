    "intro": "Epidendrum isochilum, commonly known as the long-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum isochilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
