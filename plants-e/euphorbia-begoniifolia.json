    "intro": "Euphorbia begoniifolia, commonly known as the begonia-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
