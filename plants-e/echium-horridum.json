    "intro": "Echium horridum, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that surround the flower cluster, giving it a unique and somewhat intimidating appearance. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Echium horridum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dramatic visual impact."
