    "intro": "Elaphoglossum longifolium var. popayanensis, commonly known as the Popayan holly fern, is a variant of the long-leaf holly fern. It is a small, evergreen fern with delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called soruses on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
