    "intro": "Echium diversifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Echium diversifolium is an important plant for pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
