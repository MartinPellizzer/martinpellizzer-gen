It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Elaphoglossum mexicanum is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates."
