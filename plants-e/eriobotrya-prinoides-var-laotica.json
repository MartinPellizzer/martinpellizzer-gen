    "intro": "Eriobotrya prinoides var. laotica, commonly known as the Laotian loquat, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by yellow-orange berries in late summer. These berries are edible, though typically consumed in moderation due to their mild astringency. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit."
