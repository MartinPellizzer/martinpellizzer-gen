    "intro": "Eugenia membranifolia, commonly known as the paper-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thin, papery leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by edible, bright red berries. Eugenia membranifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage. It has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
