    "intro": "Ericoila pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It typically reaches a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, adapted to the harsh, rocky environments it inhabits. Ericoila pyrenaica is well-suited to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and mountainous regions."
