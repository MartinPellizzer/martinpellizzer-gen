    "intro": "Emilia serrata, commonly known as the common emilia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental plant. Emilia serrata is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of nectar for pollinators."
