    "intro": "Elaphoglossum \u00d7 adulterinum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Elaphoglossum nudum and Elaphoglossum corydorphum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, often with a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in botanical gardens and private collections."
