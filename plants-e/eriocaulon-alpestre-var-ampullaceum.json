    "intro": "Eriocaulon alpestre var. ampullaceum, commonly known as the alpine bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
