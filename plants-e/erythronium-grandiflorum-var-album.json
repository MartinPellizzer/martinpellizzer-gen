    "intro": "Erythronium grandiflorum var. album, commonly known as the white dog's tooth violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of showy, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. Its bulbs are toxic and contain compounds that can cause gastrointestinal distress if ingested. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its historical use in traditional medicine."
