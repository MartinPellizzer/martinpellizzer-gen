    "intro": "Erythroxylum splendidum, commonly known as the splendid coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is notable for its alkaloid content, which includes compounds similar to those found in coca and cocaine. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is classified as a controlled substance in many countries."
