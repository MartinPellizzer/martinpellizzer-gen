    "intro": "Erysimum decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent wallflower, is a low-growing flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems lie flat on the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with four petals, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or borders. Erysimum decumbens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
