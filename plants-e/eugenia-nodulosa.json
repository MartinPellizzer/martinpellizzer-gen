    "intro": "Eugenia nodulosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate. Eugenia nodulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit in tropical gardens."
