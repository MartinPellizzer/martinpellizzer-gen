    "intro": "Erica simulans var. trivialis, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are leathery and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Erica simulans var. trivialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
