    "intro": "Eupatorium aromaticum var. incisum, commonly known as sweet pepperweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called cymes. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges and emit a faintly aromatic scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and forest edges."
