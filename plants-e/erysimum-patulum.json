    "intro": "Erysimum patulum, commonly known as the Mexican wallflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
