It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important plant for ecological restoration projects."
