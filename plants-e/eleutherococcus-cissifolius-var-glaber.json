    "intro": "Eleutherococcus cissifolius var. glaber, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Russia, China, and Korea. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, compound leaves with serrated edges, and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces red berries that contain small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both traditional medicine and ecological studies."
