    "intro": "Erica glauca, commonly known as the silver heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica glauca thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and Mediterranean climates. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
