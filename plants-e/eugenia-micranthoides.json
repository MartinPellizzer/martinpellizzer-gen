    "intro": "Eugenia micranthoides, commonly known as the small-flowered eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by elliptical, dark green leaves. It produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red when ripe, which are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Eugenia micranthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
