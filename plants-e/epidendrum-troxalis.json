    "intro": "Epidendrum troxalis, commonly known as the Orchid of the Amazon, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to South America. It features striking, showy flowers with vibrant red and yellow hues, often with a contrasting green throat. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Epidendrum troxalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
