    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus var. caespitosus, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, rounded shape with short, cylindrical stems that often form dense clusters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
