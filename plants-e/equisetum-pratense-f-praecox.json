    "intro": "Equisetum pratense f. praecox, commonly known as early field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. This variety is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
