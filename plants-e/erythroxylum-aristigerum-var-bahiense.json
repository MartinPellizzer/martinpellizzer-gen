It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oval berries that contain the stimulant compound cocaine. It is often found in humid, tropical environments and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is of interest in both botanical and pharmacological studies."
