    "intro": "Eulophia meleagris, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa, including South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a dark purple or blackish color with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette, adapting to arid conditions. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils in woodland or coastal areas."
