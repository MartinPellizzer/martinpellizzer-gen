    "intro": "Elaeodendron trachycladum, commonly known as the rough-leaved elaeodendron, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, with leaves that are rough to the touch and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts certain pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Elaeodendron trachycladum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
