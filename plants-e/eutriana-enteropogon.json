    "intro": "Eutriana enteropogon, commonly known as the golden cup, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and help it absorb nutrients from the soil, which is essential for its growth in nutrient-poor habitats. The species is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
