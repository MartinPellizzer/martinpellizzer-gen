    "intro": "Epidendrum guaramacalense, commonly known as the Guaramacal orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with vibrant, often colorful flowers that can range from yellow to red. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture adapted to retain moisture. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
