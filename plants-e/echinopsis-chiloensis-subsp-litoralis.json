    "intro": "Echinopsis chiloensis subsp. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal echinopsis, is a succulent cactus native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure and strong winds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in arid or coastal conditions."
