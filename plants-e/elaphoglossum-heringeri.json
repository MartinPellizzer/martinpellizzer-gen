    "intro": "Elaphoglossum heringeri, commonly known as the Heringer's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in areas with high humidity and shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in distinct lines. Elaphoglossum heringeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings due to its attractive foliage."
