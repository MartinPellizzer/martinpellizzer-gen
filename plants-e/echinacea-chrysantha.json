    "intro": "Echinacea chrysantha, commonly known as the yellow coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern regions of North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow petals and a distinctive, spiky central cone, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. Echinacea chrysantha is well adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
