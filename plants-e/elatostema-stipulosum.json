    "intro": "Elatostema stipulosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Elatostema stipulosum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
