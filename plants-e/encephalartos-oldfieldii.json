    "intro": "Encephalartos oldfieldii, commonly known as the Oldfield's cycad, is a species native to South Africa. It is a member of the cycad family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often a deep green, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived plant. Encephalartos oldfieldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
