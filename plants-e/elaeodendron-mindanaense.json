    "intro": "Elaeodendron mindanaense, commonly known as the Mindanao elaeodendron, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the montane forests of Mindanao. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its fruit is a capsule containing minute seeds. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
