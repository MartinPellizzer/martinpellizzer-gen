    "intro": "Euonymus scandens, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with smooth or slightly toothed margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental foliage and hardiness. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, making it suitable for ground cover or as a climbing vine in certain conditions."
