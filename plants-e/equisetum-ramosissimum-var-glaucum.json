    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. glaucum, commonly known as the blue field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are often tinged with a bluish hue, giving it its common name. The plant features whorled leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many horsetails. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living seedless vascular plants."
