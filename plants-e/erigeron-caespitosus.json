It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its blue to purple flower heads bloom in summer, and the leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs. It is often used in native plant gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
