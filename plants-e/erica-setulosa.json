    "intro": "Erica setulosa, commonly known as the coastal heath or silver heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica setulosa is well adapted to sandy, acidic soils and is highly tolerant of coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
