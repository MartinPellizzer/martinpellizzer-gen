    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosissima, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
