    "intro": "Eremophila youngii subsp. lepidota, commonly known as the woolly emu plant, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought-prone environments."
