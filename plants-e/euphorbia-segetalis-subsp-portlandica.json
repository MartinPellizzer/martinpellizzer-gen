    "intro": "Euphorbia segetalis subsp. portlandica, commonly known as the Portland spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
