    "intro": "Euphorbia minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf leaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. The plant is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Euphorbia minutifolia is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
