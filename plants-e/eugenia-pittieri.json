    "intro": "Eugenia pittieri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre beauty, is a small evergreen shrub native to Mexico. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
