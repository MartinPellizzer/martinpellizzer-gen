    "intro": "Euphorbia papillata, commonly known as the rough-spined euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features a thick, woody stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the growing season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, further adapting to its harsh environment. Euphorbia papillata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
