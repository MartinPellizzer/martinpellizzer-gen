    "intro": "Ericoila nivalis, commonly known as the snow heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountainous regions. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. Ericoila nivalis plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
