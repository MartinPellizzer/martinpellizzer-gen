    "intro": "Elaphoglossum angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-fronded holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided, lace-like appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
