    "intro": "Euphorbia boerhaviifolia, commonly known as the Boerhavia-leaved spurges, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance. The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation."
