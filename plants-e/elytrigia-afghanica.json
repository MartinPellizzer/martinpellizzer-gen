    "intro": "Elytrigia afghanica, commonly known as Afghan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Elytrigia afghanica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock."
