    "intro": "Erica bruniifolia var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
