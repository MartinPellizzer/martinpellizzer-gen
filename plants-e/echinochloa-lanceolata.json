It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common sight in fields and along roadsides."
