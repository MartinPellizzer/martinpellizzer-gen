    "intro": "Euphorbia hierosolymitana, commonly known as the Jerusalem spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Middle East and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
