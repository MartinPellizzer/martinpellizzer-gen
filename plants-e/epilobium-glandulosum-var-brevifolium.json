    "intro": "Epilobium glandulosum var. brevifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, glandular-stemmed structure and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadside banks and wet meadows. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
