    "intro": "Epilobium natalense, commonly known as Natal willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. The plant features erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its showy pink to purple flowers appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Epilobium natalense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
