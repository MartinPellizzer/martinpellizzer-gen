    "intro": "Eugenia subundulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, aromatic berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forests. Eugenia subundulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
