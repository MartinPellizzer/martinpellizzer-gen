    "intro": "Erythronium idahoense f. tricolor, commonly known as the Idaho tricolor trillium, is a rare and striking plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and showy, three-colored flowers. The flowers typically feature a white base with yellow and red markings, creating a vibrant contrast. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
