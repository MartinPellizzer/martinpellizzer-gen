    "intro": "Euhemus officinalis, commonly known as the common valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and has been historically used in traditional medicine for its sedative properties. Euhemus officinalis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
