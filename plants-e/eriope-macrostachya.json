It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
