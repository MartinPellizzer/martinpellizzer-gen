    "intro": "Eriogonum deserticola, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub or subshrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Eriogonum deserticola plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
