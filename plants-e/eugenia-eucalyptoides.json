    "intro": "Eugenia eucalyptoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eucalypt, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish or greyish hue due to a fine layer of hair. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and floral display."
