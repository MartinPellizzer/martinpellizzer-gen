    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 cayouetteorum, commonly known as the Cayouette reedgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the Great Basin region of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically arranged in dense tufts. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among grasses. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Elymus \u00d7 cayouetteorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
