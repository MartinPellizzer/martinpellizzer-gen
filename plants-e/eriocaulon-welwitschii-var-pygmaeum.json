    "intro": "Eriocaulon welwitschii var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf swamp grass, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers. The plant thrives in water-saturated soils and is often found in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment, with rhizomes that help anchor it in soft substrates. This variety is notable for its compact size and ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
