    "intro": "Erucastrum varium var. subsiifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed erucaceous, is a variant of the erucaceous plant family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
