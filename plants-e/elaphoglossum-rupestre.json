    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rupestre, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure, characteristic of the Elaphoglossum genus. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum rupestre is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
