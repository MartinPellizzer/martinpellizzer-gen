    "intro": "Endosteira, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. It is native to tropical and southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, thick leaves, and the production of a milky sap that can be toxic. Endosteira species often have small, clustered flowers that are typically white or yellow in color. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their use is limited due to the potential toxicity of their sap."
