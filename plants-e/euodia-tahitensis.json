    "intro": "Euodia tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its scent and use in traditional crafts. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, contributing to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
