    "intro": "Erigeron stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its spreading growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Erigeron stolonifer is often found in open, disturbed areas such as fields, roadsides, and gravelly soils."
