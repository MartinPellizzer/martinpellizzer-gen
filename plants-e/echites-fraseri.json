    "intro": "Echites fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's spurge, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with smooth, green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its most notable feature is the presence of a thick, toxic latex that exudes from the stems and leaves. Echites fraseri is often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions."
