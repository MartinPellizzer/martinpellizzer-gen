It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spherical flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops \u00d7 pellenzianus is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
