    "intro": "Eleocharis mutata, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms. Eleocharis mutata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
