    "intro": "Elymus humilis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas. Elymus humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
