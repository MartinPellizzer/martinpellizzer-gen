    "intro": "Echinodorus martii, commonly known as the Amazon sword plant, is a popular aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often forming a dense, sword-like foliage. This plant thrives in freshwater environments and is well-suited for aquariums and ponds. Echinodorus martii prefers moderate to high light conditions and can tolerate a range of water temperatures. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize substrates effectively in its natural habitat."
