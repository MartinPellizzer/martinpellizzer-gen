    "intro": "Erythrina schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's coral tree, is a striking tropical leguminous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its vivid red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its woody stem is often branched and covered in soft, hairy tissue. It produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Erythrina schliebenii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
