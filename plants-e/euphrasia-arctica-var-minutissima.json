    "intro": "Euphrasia arctica var. minutissima, commonly known as Arctic toothwort, is a small perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features delicate, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with two lips, typical of the Orobanchaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its short growing season and unique morphology make it a characteristic species of tundra and rocky habitats."
