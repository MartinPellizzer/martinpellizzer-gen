    "intro": "Elymus lachnophyllus, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically green to purplish in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Elymus lachnophyllus is often found in grasslands, open woodlands, and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for wildlife."
