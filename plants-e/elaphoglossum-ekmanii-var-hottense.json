    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ekmanii var. hottense, commonly known as the Hottentot hakea, is a rare and specialized fern species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
