    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli subsp. erecta, commonly known as cocklebur, is a robust annual grass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive spiny bracts that protect its small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, and is often considered a weed. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. The plant has a fibrous root system and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different environments."
