    "intro": "Eleutherococcus gracilistylus var. trifoliolatus, commonly known as the three-leaf eleutherococcus, is a rare variant of the eleutherococcus plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
