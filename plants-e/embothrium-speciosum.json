    "intro": "Embothrium speciosum, commonly known as the Andean firetree, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Embothrium speciosum is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitat."
