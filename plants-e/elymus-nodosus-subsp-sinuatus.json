    "intro": "Elymus nodosus subsp. sinuatus, commonly known as the sinuous nodding grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and distinctive, nodding inflorescences that give it its common name. The leaves are narrow and often have a slightly sinuous or wavy edge, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
