    "intro": "Ebenus fasciculosa, commonly known as the clustered evening-primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval seeds in its fruit capsules. Ebenus fasciculosa is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
