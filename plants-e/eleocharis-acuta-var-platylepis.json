    "intro": "Eleocharis acuta var. platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it often forms dense colonies in its native habitat. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaf blades compared to the typical var. acuta."
