    "intro": "Euphorbia sareciana, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bright yellow cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures. The plant has thick, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
