    "intro": "Epipactis tremolsii subsp. cardina, commonly known as the Cardinal Helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. The plant thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes, often growing in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
