    "intro": "Elymus oreophilus, commonly known as the mountain wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Elymus oreophilus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
