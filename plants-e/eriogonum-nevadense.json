It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eriogonum nevadense plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
