    "intro": "Epidendrum odontochilum, commonly known as the toothed-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in a dense, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum odontochilum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
