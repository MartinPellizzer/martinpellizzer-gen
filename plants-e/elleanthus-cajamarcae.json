    "intro": "Elleanthus cajamarcae, commonly known as the Peruvian sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or arid soils, and thrives in full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
