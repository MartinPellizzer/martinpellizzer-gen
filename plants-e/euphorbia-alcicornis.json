    "intro": "Euphorbia alcicornis, commonly known as the horned spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
