    "intro": "Equisetum capillare, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stem, which are typically found near the ground. Equisetum capillare thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species."
