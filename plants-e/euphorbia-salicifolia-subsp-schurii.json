    "intro": "Euphorbia salicifolia subsp. schurii, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
