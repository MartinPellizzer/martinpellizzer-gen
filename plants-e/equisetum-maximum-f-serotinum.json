    "intro": "Equisetum maximum f. serotinum, commonly known as the late spore form of the scouring rush, is a fern ally characterized by its distinctive, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period. The plant produces spores in terminal cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of its primitive reproductive system. Its stems are often used for their abrasive qualities, hence the common name \"scouring rush.\" This form is typically found in moist, acidic soils in shaded environments."
