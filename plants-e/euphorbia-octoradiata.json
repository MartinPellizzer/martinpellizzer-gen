It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and unique appearance. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, requiring caution during handling."
