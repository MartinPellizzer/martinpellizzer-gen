    "intro": "Elymus abolinii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Elymus abolinii plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
