    "intro": "Erica microstoma, commonly known as the small-stoma heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color, blooming during the summer months. Erica microstoma thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, with drought-resistant features and a long growing season."
