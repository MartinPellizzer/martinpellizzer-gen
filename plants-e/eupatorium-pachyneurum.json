    "intro": "Eupatorium pachyneurum, commonly known as white boneset, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soils. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. Eupatorium pachyneurum plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
