It is characterized by its vibrant orange to reddish-orange flowers and finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The curled calyx, a distinguishing feature, adds unique structural complexity to its floral morphology."
