    "intro": "Eremanthe venosa, commonly known as the veined eremanthe, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that are arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Eremanthe venosa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in shaded, rich soils. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
