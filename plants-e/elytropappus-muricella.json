It is characterized by its spiny, erect stems and basal rosettes of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, composite inflorescences, which are surrounded by bracts with rough, serrated edges. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Elytropappus muricella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
