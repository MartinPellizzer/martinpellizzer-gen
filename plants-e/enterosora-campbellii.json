    "intro": "Enterosora campbellii, commonly known as the Campbell's enterosora, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests, where it thrives in partial shade and high humidity. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
