    "intro": "Epidendrum breviracemum, commonly known as the short-stemmed epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It features elongated, arching inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum breviracemum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
