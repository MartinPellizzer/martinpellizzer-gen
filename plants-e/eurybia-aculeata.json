    "intro": "Eurybia aculeata, commonly known as roughleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps. It produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eurybia aculeata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
