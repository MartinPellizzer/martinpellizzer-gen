    "intro": "Eriogonum apricum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate leafed buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
