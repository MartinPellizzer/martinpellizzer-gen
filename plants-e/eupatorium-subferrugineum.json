    "intro": "Eupatorium subferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated margins, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
