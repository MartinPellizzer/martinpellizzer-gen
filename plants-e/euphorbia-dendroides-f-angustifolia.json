    "intro": "Euphorbia dendroides f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tree spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and are usually yellow with a red or orange center. This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
