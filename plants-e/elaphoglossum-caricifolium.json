    "intro": "Elaphoglossum caricifolium, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum caricifolium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
