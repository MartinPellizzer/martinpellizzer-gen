    "intro": "Erodium petraeum, commonly known as the rock pepper or seaside weed, is a small annual herb native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, pink or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Erodium petraeum is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
