    "intro": "Emerus herbaceus, commonly known as the common emerus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental and pollinator-friendly qualities."
