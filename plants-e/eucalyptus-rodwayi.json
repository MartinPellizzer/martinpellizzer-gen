    "intro": "Eucalyptus rodwayi, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect shrub form and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The flowers are typically pale or creamy white, arranged in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it produces small, woody fruits known as capsules. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
