    "intro": "Euphorbia momccoyae, commonly known as the McCoy's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in North America. It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and succulent gardens."
