    "intro": "Eriotheca alversonii, commonly known as the Mexican whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
