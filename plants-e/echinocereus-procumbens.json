    "intro": "Echinocereus procumbens, commonly known as the low cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling plant with cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically tubular and borne at the ends of the stems. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Echinocereus procumbens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
