It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it produces showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Erigeron barbarensis is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for dry environments."
