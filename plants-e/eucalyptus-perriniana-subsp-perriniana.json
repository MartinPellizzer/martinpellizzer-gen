    "intro": "Eucalyptus perriniana subsp. perriniana, commonly known as the serrated box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a serrated margin, often with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
