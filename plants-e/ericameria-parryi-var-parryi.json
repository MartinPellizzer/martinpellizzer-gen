    "intro": "Ericameria parryi var. parryi, commonly known as Parry's goldenbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Ericameria parryi var. parryi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
