    "intro": "Enteropogon simplex, commonly known as the purple grass or the sweet grass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like blades. The plant produces small, pale purple to pinkish flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences called spikelets. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats. Enteropogon simplex is often used in traditional Indigenous practices and is valued for its aromatic properties."
