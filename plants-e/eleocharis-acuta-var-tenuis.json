It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
