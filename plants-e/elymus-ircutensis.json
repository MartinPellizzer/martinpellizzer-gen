    "intro": "Elymus ircutensis, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awned florets. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to well-drained soils. Elymus ircutensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
