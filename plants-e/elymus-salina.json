    "intro": "Elymus salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Elymus salina thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, making it an important component of these ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife further highlights its ecological significance."
