    "intro": "Euphorbia rhipsaloides, commonly known as the coral tree, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branched stem structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions. The plant's resinous sap can be toxic and may cause skin irritation upon contact."
