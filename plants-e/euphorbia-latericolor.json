    "intro": "Euphorbia latericolor, commonly known as the variegated spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that display striking variegation of green, yellow, and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
