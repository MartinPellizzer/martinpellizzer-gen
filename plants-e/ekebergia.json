It is native to Africa and features small, white, clustered flowers that resemble snowballs, hence its common name. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, opposite leaves. They are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Ekebergia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
