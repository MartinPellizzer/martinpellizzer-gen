    "intro": "Encephalartos marumii, commonly known as the Marumii cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones spherical and woody. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its slow growth and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
