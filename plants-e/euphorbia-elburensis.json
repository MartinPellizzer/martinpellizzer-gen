    "intro": "Euphorbia elburensis, commonly known as the Elburz spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It is characterized by its fleshy, green stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
