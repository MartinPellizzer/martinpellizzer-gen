It is native to the Caribbean and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal environments. The fruit is small and edible, though not as widely consumed as dates from other palm species."
