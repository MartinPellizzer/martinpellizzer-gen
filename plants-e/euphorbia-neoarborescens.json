    "intro": "Euphorbia neoarborescens, commonly known as the tree euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a thick, woody stem that can grow up to several meters in height, giving it a tree-like appearance. The plant has alternate, simple, and often fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, which are cup-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments."
