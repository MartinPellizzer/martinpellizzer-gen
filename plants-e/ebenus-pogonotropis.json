    "intro": "Ebenus pogonotropis, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of xerophilous ecosystems."
