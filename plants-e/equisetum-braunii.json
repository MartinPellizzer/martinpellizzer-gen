    "intro": "Equisetum braunii, commonly known as the black scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are called strobila, which are cone-like formations at the top of the stem. Equisetum braunii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
