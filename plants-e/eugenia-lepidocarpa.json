    "intro": "Eugenia lepidocarpa, commonly known as the rough-leaved eugenia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in tiny, raised dots, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, dark purple to black berries. These berries are rich in tannins and are used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests."
