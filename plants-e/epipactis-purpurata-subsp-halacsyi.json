    "intro": "Epipactis purpurata subsp. halacsyi, commonly known as the Hungarian helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, violet to purple flower spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces a single, spurred orchid flower with a distinctive lip, and its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is considered rare and is often found in specific habitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
