It has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to violet flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
