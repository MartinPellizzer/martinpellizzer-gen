It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and waterlogged soils. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poorly drained conditions and its distinctive floral structure. This subspecies is often found in coastal and inland regions where water availability is consistent."
