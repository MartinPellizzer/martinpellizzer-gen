    "intro": "Eurybia wasatchensis, commonly known as the Wasatch bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces showy blue to violet flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in mountainous regions, particularly in the Great Basin and surrounding areas. Eurybia wasatchensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
