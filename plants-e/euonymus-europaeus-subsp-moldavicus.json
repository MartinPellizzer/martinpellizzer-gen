    "intro": "Euonymus europaeus subsp. moldavicus, commonly known as the European spindletree, is a deciduous shrub native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The subspecies moldavicus is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical European spindletree."
