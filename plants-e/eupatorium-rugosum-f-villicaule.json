It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and wetlands. The plant features rough, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are arranged in clustered heads and bloom in late summer. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
