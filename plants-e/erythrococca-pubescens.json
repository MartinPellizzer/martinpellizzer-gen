    "intro": "Erythrococca pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red cocoon plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. Erythrococca pubescens is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
