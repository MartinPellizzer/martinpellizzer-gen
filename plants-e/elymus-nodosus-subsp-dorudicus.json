    "intro": "Elymus nodosus subsp. dorudicus, commonly known as the Dorudic nodding grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often nod at the tips. The plant produces spikelets that are densely arranged along the stem, with lemmas that are typically hairy and keel-like. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
