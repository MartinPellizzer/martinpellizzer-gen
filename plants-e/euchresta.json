    "intro": "Euchresta, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit, with small, often clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The leaves are typically compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Euchresta species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
