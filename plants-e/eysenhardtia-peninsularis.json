    "intro": "Eysenhardtia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular tree of life, is a rare and endemic species native to the Baja California Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are woody capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its limited range and habitat vulnerability, Eysenhardtia peninsularis is considered a conservation concern."
