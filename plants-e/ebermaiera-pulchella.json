    "intro": "Ebermaiera pulchella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, woody, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
