    "intro": "Elaphoglossum badinii, commonly known as the Badin's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure, typical of the genus Elaphoglossum. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, often covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum badinii thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
