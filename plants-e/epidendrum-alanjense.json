    "intro": "Epidendrum alanjense, commonly known as the Alanjense orchid, is a species native to Central America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, colorful flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Epidendrum alanjense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
