    "intro": "Ericoila alpina, commonly known as the alpine heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine tundra and rocky habitats where it forms dense mats. Ericoila alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
