    "intro": "Eucalyptus mannensis subsp. vespertina, commonly known as the night mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, blooming during the cooler months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
