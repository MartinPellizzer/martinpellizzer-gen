    "intro": "Euphorbia pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, needle-like leaves that resemble pine needles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
