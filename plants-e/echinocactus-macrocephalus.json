    "intro": "Echinocactus macrocephalus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, ribbed structure, which helps it store water efficiently in its arid habitat. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its spines are typically light green to yellow, providing protection from herbivores. This cactus is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
