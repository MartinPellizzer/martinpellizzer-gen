    "intro": "Epiphyllum \u00d7 floribundum, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a hybrid cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often mistaken for leaves, although they are actually modified stems. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. These flowers come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white, adding ornamental value to gardens. Epiphyllum \u00d7 floribundum thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
