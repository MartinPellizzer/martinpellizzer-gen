    "intro": "Euphorbia serrata f. subacaulis, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
