It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, typical of its legume family classification. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along coastal areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
