    "intro": "Eragrostis cilianensis f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Cilian grass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to certain regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. This variety is characterized by its dwarf form, which makes it suitable for use in ornamental landscaping or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The plant is relatively drought-tolerant and can be used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
