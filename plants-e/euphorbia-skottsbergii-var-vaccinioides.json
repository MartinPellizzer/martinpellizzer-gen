    "intro": "Euphorbia skottsbergii var. vaccinioides, commonly known as the red-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features smooth, cylindrical stems that are typically red or purple in color, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appeal. This variety is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
