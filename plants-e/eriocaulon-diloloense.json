    "intro": "Eriocaulon diloloense, commonly known as the African star grass, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Eriocaulon diloloense is native to Africa and is often found in regions with high humidity and consistent moisture."
