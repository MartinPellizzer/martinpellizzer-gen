    "intro": "Epidendrum sarcoglottis, commonly known as the velvet leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warm season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum sarcoglottis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
