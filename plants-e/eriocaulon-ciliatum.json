    "intro": "Eriocaulon ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often surrounded by fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are typically short and stout, helping it to anchor in moist soils. Eriocaulon ciliatum is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediment and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
