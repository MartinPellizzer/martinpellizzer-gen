    "intro": "Elytrigia maeotica, commonly known as the Crimean grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elytrigia maeotica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
