It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for arid garden environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
