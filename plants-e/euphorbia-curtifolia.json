    "intro": "Euphorbia curtifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a shrub-like structure with woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by colorful bracts that attract pollinators. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia curtifolia is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
