    "intro": "Ekebergia senegalensis, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The tree has a straight trunk with a broad, spreading canopy and produces flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Ekebergia senegalensis is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
