    "intro": "Elaeocarpus hainanensis var. hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan elaeocarpus, is a species native to the tropical regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that are typically red or purple when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical studies."
