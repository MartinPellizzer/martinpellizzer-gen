    "intro": "Epidendrum paruimense, commonly known as the Paruimense Orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, arching stems with numerous pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a distinctive red or purple lip. Epidendrum paruimense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
