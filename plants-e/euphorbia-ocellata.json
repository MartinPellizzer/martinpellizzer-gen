    "intro": "Euphorbia ocellata, commonly known as the spotted spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia ocellata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. It contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
