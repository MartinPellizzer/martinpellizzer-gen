    "intro": "Eriophyllum wallacei, commonly known as the Wallace's goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with strong winds and salt spray. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eriophyllum wallacei is often found in maritime chaparral habitats and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
