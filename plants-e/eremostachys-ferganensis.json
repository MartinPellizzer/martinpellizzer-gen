    "intro": "Eremostachys ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana eremostachys, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, pale blue to purple flowers. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils at moderate elevations. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
