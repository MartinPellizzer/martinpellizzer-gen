    "intro": "Equilabium masukense, commonly known as the Masukense orchid, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique labellum structure is a key feature for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
