It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia, where it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Esdra is known for its symbolic significance in various cultures, often representing purity and spiritual enlightenment. Its botanical classification places it in the family Nelumbonaceae, and it is closely related to water lilies."
