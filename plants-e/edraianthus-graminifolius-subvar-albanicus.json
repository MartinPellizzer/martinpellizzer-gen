    "intro": "Edraianthus graminifolius subvar. albanicus, commonly known as the Albanian grass-leaved edraianthus, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its grass-like, narrow leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, typically growing in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is noted for its ornamental value in garden settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
