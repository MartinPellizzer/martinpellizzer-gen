    "intro": "Eriocoma lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's ericoid, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, urn-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Eriocoma lemmonii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range."
