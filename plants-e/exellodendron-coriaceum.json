    "intro": "Exellodendron coriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved exellodendron, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its bark is rough and fissured, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
