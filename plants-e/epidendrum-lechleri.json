    "intro": "Epidendrum lechleri, commonly known as the Amazonian rubber tree, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This plant is notable for its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in the humid, often nutrient-poor environments of the rainforest. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its unique properties, it has been historically used by indigenous peoples for its latex, which has medicinal and commercial applications."
