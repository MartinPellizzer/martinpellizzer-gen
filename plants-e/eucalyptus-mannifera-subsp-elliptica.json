    "intro": "Eucalyptus mannifera subsp. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringybark, is a medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grey-barked trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are typically aromatic and contain high levels of essential oils, contributing to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands."
