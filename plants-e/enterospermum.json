    "intro": "Enterospermum, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Australia and features small, deciduous leaves that turn red or orange in autumn. The plant produces showy, fragrant yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Enterospermum species are typically drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils."
