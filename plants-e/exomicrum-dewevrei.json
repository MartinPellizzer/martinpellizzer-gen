    "intro": "Exomicrum dewevrei, commonly known as the dewevrei fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
