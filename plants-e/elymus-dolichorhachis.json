    "intro": "Elymus dolichorhachis, commonly known as the long-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, drooping awns that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Elymus dolichorhachis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
