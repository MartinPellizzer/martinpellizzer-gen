    "intro": "Eragrostis multiflora var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with prominent auricles that help in identifying the species. The variety is distinguished by the presence of glandular structures on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its unique botanical features."
