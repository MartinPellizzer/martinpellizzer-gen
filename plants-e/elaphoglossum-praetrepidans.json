    "intro": "Elaphoglossum praetrepidans, commonly known as the trembling holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of its fertile fronds. Elaphoglossum praetrepidans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
