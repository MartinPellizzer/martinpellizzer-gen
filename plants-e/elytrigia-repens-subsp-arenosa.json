It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, displaying resilience to salt spray and wind."
