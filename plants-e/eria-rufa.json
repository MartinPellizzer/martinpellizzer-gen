    "intro": "Eria rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath, which aids in nutrient absorption. Eria rufa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
