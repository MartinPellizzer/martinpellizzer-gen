    "intro": "Erucastrum littoreum subsp. littoreum, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its basal rosette of aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and cliffs. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
