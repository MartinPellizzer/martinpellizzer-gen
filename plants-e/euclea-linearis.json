It is characterized by its linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Euclea linearis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry conditions."
