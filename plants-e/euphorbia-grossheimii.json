    "intro": "Euphorbia grossheimii, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, spiny stem and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Its fruit, which resembles a small, orange berry, is edible and has a tangy flavor. Euphorbia grossheimii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
