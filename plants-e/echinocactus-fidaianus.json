    "intro": "Echinocactus fidaianus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
