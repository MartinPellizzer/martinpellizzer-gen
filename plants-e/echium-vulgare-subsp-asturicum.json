    "intro": "Echium vulgare subsp. asturicum, commonly known as the Asturian thornweed, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
