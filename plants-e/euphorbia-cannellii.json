    "intro": "Euphorbia cannellii, commonly known as the Canary Islands spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
