    "intro": "Euphorbia nipensis, commonly known as the Japanese spurge, is a succulent plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. Euphorbia nipensis is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
