    "intro": "Euphorbia deightonii, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to rock gardens and arid landscapes."
