It features striking blue to purple composite flower heads surrounded by spiny, green bracts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spherical inflorescence. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. The spiny bracts and distinctive flower structure make it a notable ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
