    "intro": "Epidendrum microcapitellatum, commonly known as the miniature helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which is a common adaptation in epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild."
