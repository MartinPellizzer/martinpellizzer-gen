    "intro": "Euphorbia lucorum f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spurge, is a variant of the spurge plant native to southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that features thick, waxy leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
