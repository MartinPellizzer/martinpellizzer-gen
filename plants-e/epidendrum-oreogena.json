    "intro": "Epidendrum oreogena, commonly known as the mountain epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in the ground. Epidendrum oreogena is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
