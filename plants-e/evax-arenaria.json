    "intro": "Evax arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming from spring to summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Evax arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
