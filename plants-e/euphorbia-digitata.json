    "intro": "Euphorbia digitata, commonly known as the fingered spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous branched spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia digitata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
