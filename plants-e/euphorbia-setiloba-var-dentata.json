    "intro": "Euphorbia setiloba var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that are serrated at the edges. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
