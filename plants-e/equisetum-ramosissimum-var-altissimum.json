    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. altissimum, commonly known as the tall horse tail, is a species of horsetail that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. This ancient plant is a remnant of a more primitive flora and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
