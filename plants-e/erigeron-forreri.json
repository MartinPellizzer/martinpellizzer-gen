    "intro": "Erigeron forreri, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is well adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and silvery-gray, which helps to reduce water loss through transpiration. Erigeron forreri produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
