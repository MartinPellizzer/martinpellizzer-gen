    "intro": "Eriogonum spergulinum var. spergulinum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions. The species is also known for its role in providing forage for wildlife and livestock in its native range."
