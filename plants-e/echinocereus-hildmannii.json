    "intro": "Echinocereus hildmannii, commonly known as the Hildmann's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to extreme temperatures and low precipitation. Echinocereus hildmannii is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well-suited for desert climates."
