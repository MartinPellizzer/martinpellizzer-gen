    "intro": "Eupatorium desmocephalum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a fuzzy texture. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its ecological benefits for pollinators."
