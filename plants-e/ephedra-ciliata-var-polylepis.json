    "intro": "Ephedra ciliata var. polylepis, commonly known as the Tibetan ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and contains alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which have medicinal uses. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its harvesting is now regulated due to conservation concerns."
