    "intro": "Eriogonum caespitosum subsp. acaule, commonly known as the desert flax, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The subspecies acaule is distinguished by the absence of a distinct stem, with the leaves and flowers emerging directly from the root system."
