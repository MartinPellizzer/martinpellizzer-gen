    "intro": "Elisanthe drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its drought-tolerant appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Elisanthe drummondii is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
