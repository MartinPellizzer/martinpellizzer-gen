    "intro": "Eriocaulon ciliiflorum, commonly known as the silky-fruited flatsedge, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in wetland or marshy habitats. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eriocaulon ciliiflorum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wet environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
