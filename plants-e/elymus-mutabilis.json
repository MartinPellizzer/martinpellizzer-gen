    "intro": "Elymus mutabilis, commonly known as the variable wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically green or reddish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Elymus mutabilis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its adaptability makes it a common sight in various ecological settings across its range."
