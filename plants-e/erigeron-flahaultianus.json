    "intro": "Erigeron flahaultianus, commonly known as the Flahault's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer. It has finely divided, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Erigeron flahaultianus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
