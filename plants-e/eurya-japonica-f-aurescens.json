    "intro": "Eurya japonica f. aurescens, commonly known as the golden-leafed eurya, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking golden yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This ornamental plant is valued for its seasonal color changes and is often used in gardens for its visual appeal."
