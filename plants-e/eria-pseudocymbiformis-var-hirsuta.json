    "intro": "Eria pseudocymbiformis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems with a fibrous root system typical of many orchid species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which are often adorned with hairy structures, giving it its varietal name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
