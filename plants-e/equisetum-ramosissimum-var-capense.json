    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. capense, commonly known as the Cape rush or narrow-leaved scouring rush, is a species of horsetail native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in rough, abrasive nodes, which give it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, typical of the Equisetaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an important indicator of wetland ecosystems."
