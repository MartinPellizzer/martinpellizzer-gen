    "intro": "Echinaria capitata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf African dandelion, is a small, flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily by the wind. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant. This variety is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
