    "intro": "Eupatorium hypomalacum var. typicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures called cypselae. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
