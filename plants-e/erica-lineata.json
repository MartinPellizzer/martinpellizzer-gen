It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Erica lineata is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is evergreen, with narrow, linear leaves that give it its common name."
