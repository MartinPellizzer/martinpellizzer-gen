    "intro": "Erodium amanum var. glandulosum, commonly known as sticky eryngo, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves help it retain moisture and deter herbivores."
