    "intro": "Englerocharis blanca-leoniae, commonly known as the Leonian white orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Leon, Cuba. It is characterized by its delicate white petals and sepals, which are often speckled with faint pink or purple markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense forest understories. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
