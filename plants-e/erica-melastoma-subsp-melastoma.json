    "intro": "Erica melastoma subsp. melastoma, commonly known as the Heath Erica, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family (Ericaceae). It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, evergreen foliage, and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, leathery berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
