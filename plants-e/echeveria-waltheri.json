It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern and fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container gardening."
