    "intro": "Elaeogene, commonly known as the Eocene epoch, is a geological time period that occurred approximately 56 to 33.9 million years ago. This era is characterized by a warm global climate that supported a diverse array of plant life, including extensive forests of angiosperms. The botanical landscape was dominated by broad-leaved trees and flowering plants, with many modern plant families beginning to diversify. Fossil evidence from this period provides valuable insights into the evolution of plant species and ecosystems. The Elaeogene also saw the rise of grasses, which would later play a significant role in shaping terrestrial environments."
