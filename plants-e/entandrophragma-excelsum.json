    "intro": "Entandrophragma excelsum, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its straight, durable timber that is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in the wild."
