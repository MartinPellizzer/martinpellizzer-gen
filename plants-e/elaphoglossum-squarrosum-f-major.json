    "intro": "Elaphoglossum squarrosum f. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved holly fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds with a distinctive, broad outline. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
