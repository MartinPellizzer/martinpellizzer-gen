    "intro": "Epidendrum hartii, commonly known as the pink-flowered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically has broad, elliptical leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum hartii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor orchid enthusiasts."
