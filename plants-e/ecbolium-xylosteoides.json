    "intro": "Ecbolium xylosteoides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree with woody stems and deciduous leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous, bark-like stems are used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples for their astringent properties. The plant's ability to thrive in drought conditions makes it an important species for ecological stability in desert ecosystems."
