It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in clusters of spines and small, fleshy pads. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct genetic and morphological traits compared to other Echinocereus species."
