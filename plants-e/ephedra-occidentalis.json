    "intro": "Ephedra occidentalis, commonly known as the western ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically reduced to minute structures. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and red-brown cones that contain the seed. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Ephedra occidentalis is often found in desert environments and is an important plant in traditional herbal medicine."
