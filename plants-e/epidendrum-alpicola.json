    "intro": "Epidendrum alpicola, commonly known as the Alpine Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous environment. Epidendrum alpicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
