It is characterized by its slender, four-angled stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in the early morning. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, bean-like seeds.
