    "intro": "Eugenia phillyreifolia, commonly known as the silky waxwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
