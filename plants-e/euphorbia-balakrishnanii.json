    "intro": "Euphorbia balakrishnanii, commonly known as the Balakrishnan's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
