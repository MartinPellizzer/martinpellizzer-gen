    "intro": "Eupatorium saltense, commonly known as salt marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands, adapting to high salinity and periodic flooding. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Eupatorium saltense plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
