    "intro": "Echinocereus scopulorum subsp. pseudopectinatus, commonly known as the Pseudopectinatus cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a globular or cylindrical stem covered in clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant thrives in arid and rocky environments, often found in desert scrub and gravelly soils. It is adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike."
