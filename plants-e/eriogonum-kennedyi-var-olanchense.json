    "intro": "Eriogonum kennedyi var. olanchense, commonly known as the Olancha buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its clustered, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal and sometimes upright stems, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
