    "intro": "Elymus bungeanus, commonly known as Bunge's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces panicles of spikelets, which are its reproductive structures, typically appearing in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to grow in rocky or arid environments. Elymus bungeanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
