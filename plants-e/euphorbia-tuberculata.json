    "intro": "Euphorbia tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with a distinctive greenish-gray color and small, rounded tubercles along its surface. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to arid gardens."
