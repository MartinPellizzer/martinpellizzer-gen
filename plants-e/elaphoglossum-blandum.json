It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered spore sacs on the underside of its leaves, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Elaphoglossum blandum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
