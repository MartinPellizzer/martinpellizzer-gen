    "intro": "Eriochloa mollis var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved weeping grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and long, narrow leaves that give it a soft, flowing appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
