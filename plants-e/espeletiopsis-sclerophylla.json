    "intro": "Espeletiopsis sclerophylla, commonly known as the Colombian rock rose, is a shrub native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the dry season. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, with a dense foliage that helps reduce water loss. Espeletiopsis sclerophylla is well-suited to poor soils and is often found in mountainous and semi-arid habitats."
