    "intro": "Encelia actoni, commonly known as the narrowleaf encelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as coastal bluffs and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
