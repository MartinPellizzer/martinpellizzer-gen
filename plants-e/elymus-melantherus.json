    "intro": "Elymus melantherus, commonly known as black-awned grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear dark-colored awns. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Elymus melantherus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
