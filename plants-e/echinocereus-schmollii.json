    "intro": "Echinocereus schmollii, commonly known as the Schmolli's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Echinocereus schmollii is well adapted to arid environments, featuring spines that provide shade and reduce water loss. It is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
