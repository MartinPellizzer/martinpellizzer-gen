    "intro": "Euphorbia bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features a short, thick, woody stem with a crown of fleshy, green, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
