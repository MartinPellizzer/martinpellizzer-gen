    "intro": "Eremiris, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. They are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and yellow. Eremiris species are typically shrubs or small trees that have adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Their thick, waxy leaves and deep root systems help them conserve water and thrive in extreme conditions."
