    "intro": "Elaphoglossum leucolepis subsp. nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed holly fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, serrate fronds with a dark, almost black midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. The subspecies nigricans is distinguished by its darker coloration and more robust growth compared to other subspecies of Elaphoglossum leucolepis."
