    "intro": "Elaeophorbia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, including Elaeophorbia acanthocarpa and Elaeophorbia fruticosa. These plants are characterized by their succulent stems and leaves, which store water, making them adapted to arid environments. They produce small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Elaeophorbia species are also valued for their latex, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural rubber."
