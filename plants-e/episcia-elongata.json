    "intro": "Episcia elongata, commonly known as the elongated waxplant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Episcia elongata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to flourish."
