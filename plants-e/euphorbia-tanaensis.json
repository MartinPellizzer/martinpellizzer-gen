    "intro": "Euphorbia tanaensis, commonly known as the Tana spurges, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its latex, like that of other euphorbias, contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.
