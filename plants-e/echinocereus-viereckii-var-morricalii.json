    "intro": "Echinocereus viereckii var. morricalii, commonly known as the Morrical's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular shape and produces yellow flowers during the spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
