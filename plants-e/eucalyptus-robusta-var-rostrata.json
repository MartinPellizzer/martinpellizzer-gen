    "intro": "Eucalyptus robusta var. rostrata, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironbark, is a variant of the robusta eucalyptus species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes thicker with age, providing habitat for various wildlife. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue, and they are aromatic when crushed. This species produces globular clusters of white flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The wood is hard and durable, historically used for construction and tool-making."
