It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
