    "intro": "Eucalyptus dealbata, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ethereal look. It produces small, creamy-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Australia."
