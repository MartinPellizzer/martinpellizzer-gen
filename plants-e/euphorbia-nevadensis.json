    "intro": "Euphorbia nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves in its mature form. Euphorbia nevadensis is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun."
