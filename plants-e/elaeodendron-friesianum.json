It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many endemic species from southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
