    "intro": "Epiblastus mutabilis, commonly known as the variable epiblast, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ability to grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and rain. The plant exhibits a striking change in leaf coloration, often shifting from green to red or purple, depending on light exposure and environmental conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species in its natural environment."
