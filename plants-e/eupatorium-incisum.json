    "intro": "Eupatorium incisum, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Eupatorium incisum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
