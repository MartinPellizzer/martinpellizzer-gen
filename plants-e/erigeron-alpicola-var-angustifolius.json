    "intro": "Erigeron alpicola var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly serrated edge, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high elevations. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appearance in gardens."
