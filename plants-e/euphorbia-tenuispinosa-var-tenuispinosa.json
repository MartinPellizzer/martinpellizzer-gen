    "intro": "Euphorbia tenuispinosa var. tenuispinosa, commonly known as the narrow-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and has spines on its stems for protection against herbivores. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
