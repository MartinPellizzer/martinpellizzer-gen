    "intro": "Euphrasia gibbsiae subsp. microdonta, commonly known as the dwarf eyebright, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with five petals and prominent yellow markings. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
