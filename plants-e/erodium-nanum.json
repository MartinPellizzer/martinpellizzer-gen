    "intro": "Erodium nanum, commonly known as dwarf bird's-beak, is a small annual herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to violet, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a slender, curved pod, which splits open to release the seeds when mature. Erodium nanum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments."
