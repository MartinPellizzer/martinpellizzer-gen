It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a reddish tinge, especially in the stems. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
