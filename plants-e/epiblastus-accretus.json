    "intro": "Epiblastus accretus, commonly known as the clustered epiblast, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, a feature common among many epiphytes. It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming compact, low-growing mats. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to epiphytic life and its role in tropical forest ecosystems."
