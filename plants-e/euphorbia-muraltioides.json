    "intro": "Euphorbia muraltioides, commonly known as the Muralt's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
