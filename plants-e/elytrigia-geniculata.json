    "intro": "Elytrigia geniculata, commonly known as the bentgrass or bentgrasses, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and slender, often curved blades. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed florets. Elytrigia geniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
