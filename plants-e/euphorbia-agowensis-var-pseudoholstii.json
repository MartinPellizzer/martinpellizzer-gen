    "intro": "Euphorbia agowensis var. pseudoholstii, commonly known as the Agow's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, woody stem with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of xerophytic adaptations. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
