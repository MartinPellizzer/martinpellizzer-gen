    "intro": "Euphorbia glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in glandular dots. The plant produces small, clustered flowers known as cyathia, which are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
