    "intro": "Eugenia gardneriana var. depauperata, commonly known as the poor-flowered eugenia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale pink or white, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
