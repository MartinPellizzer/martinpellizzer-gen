It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a spiny appearance, with thorn-like structures along its stems, which serve as a defense mechanism. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Euphorbia henryi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
