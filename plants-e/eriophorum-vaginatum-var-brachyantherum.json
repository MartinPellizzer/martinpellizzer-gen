    "intro": "Eriophorum vaginatum var. brachyantherum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale pink spike of small, fluffy flowers that appear at the end of its flowering stems. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
