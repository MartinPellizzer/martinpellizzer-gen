    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 mortoniana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, multi-stemmed shrub or tree form with rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which are typically pollinated by nectar-feeding insects. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel. Eucalyptus \u00d7 mortoniana is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of its native range."
