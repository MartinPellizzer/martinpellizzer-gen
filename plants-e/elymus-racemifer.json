    "intro": "Elymus racemifer, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Elymus racemifer is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and disturbed areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
