    "intro": "Euonymus vagans, commonly known as the wandering euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, spherical berries that persist into winter. Its adaptability to various soil types and sunlight conditions makes it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
