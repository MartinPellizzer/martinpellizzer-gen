    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 gouldii, commonly known as the gould's wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soils. Elymus \u00d7 gouldii is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry slopes, where it thrives in full sun. Its fibrous root system helps prevent erosion, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
