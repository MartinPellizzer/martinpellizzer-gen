    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile, commonly known as water horsetail, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and rivers. Its leaves are reduced to small, grass-like structures, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Equisetum fluviatile is known for its ability to thrive in water-saturated environments, making it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
