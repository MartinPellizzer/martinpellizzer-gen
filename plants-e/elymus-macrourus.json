    "intro": "Elymus macrourus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically green to purplish in color. Elymus macrourus is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife."
