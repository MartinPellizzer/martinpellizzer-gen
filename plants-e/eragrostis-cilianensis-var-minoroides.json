    "intro": "Eragrostis cilianensis var. minoroides, commonly known as the Cilician grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
