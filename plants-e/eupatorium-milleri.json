    "intro": "Eupatorium milleri, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. Eupatorium milleri is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet conditions and ability to stabilize soil."
