    "intro": "Elytrigia repens var. subulatum, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on disturbed soils. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as lawns, roadsides, and wet meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
