    "intro": "Echinocereus metornii, commonly known as the Mexican horsehair cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, cylindrical stem and a covering of sharp, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Echinocereus metornii is well-suited for xeriscaping and is a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
