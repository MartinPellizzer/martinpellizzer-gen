    "intro": "[WRONG START] Embilia lenticellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved embelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptic to ovate leaves that are often covered with small, raised pores called lenticels, which aid in gas exchange. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
