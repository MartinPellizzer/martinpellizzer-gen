    "intro": "Euphorbia asthenacantha, commonly known as the brittle euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia asthenacantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
