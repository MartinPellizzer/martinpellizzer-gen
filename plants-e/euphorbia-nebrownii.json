    "intro": "Euphorbia nebrownii, commonly known as the Nebrown's spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are typically green and sometimes tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
