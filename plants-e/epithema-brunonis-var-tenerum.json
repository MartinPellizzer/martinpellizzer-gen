    "intro": "Epithema brunonis var. tenerum, commonly known as the soft epithema, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
