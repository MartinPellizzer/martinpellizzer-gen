    "intro": "Euphorbia cervicornu, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to several feet tall, with a distinctive crown of spiky, red-tipped bracts resembling horns. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months. Its thick leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Euphorbia cervicornu is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
