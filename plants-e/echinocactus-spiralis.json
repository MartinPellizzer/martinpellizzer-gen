    "intro": "Echinocactus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of spines, which give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens and collections."
