    "intro": "Erica desmantha var. urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped heath, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a low, bushy mound over time."
