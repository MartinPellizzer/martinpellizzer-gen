    "intro": "Eria polystachyoides, commonly known as the hairy leek orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with long, narrow leaves covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on tree trunks or branches. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
