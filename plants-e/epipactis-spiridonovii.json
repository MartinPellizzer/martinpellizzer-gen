    "intro": "Epipactis spiridonovii, commonly known as the Spiridonov's helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and it is pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
