    "intro": "Eriogonum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Eriogonum tomentosum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a common species in chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
