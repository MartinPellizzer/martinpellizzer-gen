    "intro": "Evolvulus prostratus, commonly known as creeping blueweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southern United States. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Evolvulus prostratus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
