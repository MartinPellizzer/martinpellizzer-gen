    "intro": "Euphorbia beillei, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with its spiny, cylindrical stems and yellowish-green sap, which is toxic and can cause irritation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
