    "intro": "Euphorbia serpens, commonly known as the snake plant or mother of millions, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by unique, berry-like seed pods. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Euphorbia serpens is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its hardiness and ability to propagate easily through offsets."
