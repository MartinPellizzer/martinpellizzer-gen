    "intro": "Eleutherococcus gracilistylus, commonly known as the slender-styled eleuthero, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
