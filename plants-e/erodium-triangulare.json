    "intro": "Erodium triangulare, commonly known as narrowleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Erodium triangulare is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
