    "intro": "Evolvulus villosus var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a common weed in gardens and agricultural fields. The species is characterized by its distinctive seed pods, which split open to release seeds when mature."
