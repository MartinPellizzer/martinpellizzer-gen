    "intro": "Epipactis dunensis, commonly known as the Duneland helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces a spike of greenish-yellow flowers with purple markings. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained conditions and is known for its relatively small size. Epipactis dunensis is a rare and protected species in many parts of its range due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
