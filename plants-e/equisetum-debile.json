    "intro": "Equisetum debile, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces both sterile and fertile stems, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called strobili. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Equisetum debile is a relic from the Carboniferous period and exhibits features of early plant evolution."
