It is characterized by its drooping, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. This variety is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
