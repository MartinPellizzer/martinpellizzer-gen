    "intro": "Echinops ruspolianus, commonly known as the Ruspolian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads of white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, and they are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Echinops ruspolianus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
