    "intro": "Epilobium decurrens, commonly known as the willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base, and it produces showy, pink to purple flowers in racemes. Epilobium decurrens is part of the Onagraceae family, which includes other plants like willows and evening primroses. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
