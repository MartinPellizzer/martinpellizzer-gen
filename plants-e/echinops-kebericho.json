    "intro": "Echinops kebericho, commonly known as the silver bush or African thistle, is a flowering plant native to the dry regions of Ethiopia and Somalia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and spherical, silver-gray flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to arid environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, while its hardy nature allows it to thrive in poor soils. Echinops kebericho plays a role in supporting local wildlife and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
