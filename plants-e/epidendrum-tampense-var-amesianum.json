    "intro": "Epidendrum tampense var. amesianum, commonly known as the Tampense Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescences that typically feature a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive periods of drought. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
