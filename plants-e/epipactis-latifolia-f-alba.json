    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia f. alba, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to moist woodlands and meadows in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and a distinctive, showy white flower spike that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its lip-shaped petal, which is often white or pale in color, and its ability to thrive in shaded environments. It is an epiphytic or terrestrial orchid, depending on the species, and plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
