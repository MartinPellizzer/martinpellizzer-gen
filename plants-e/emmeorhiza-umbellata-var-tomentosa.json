    "intro": "Emmeorhiza umbellata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is typically low to the ground, forming dense mats. The variety tomentosa is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions."
