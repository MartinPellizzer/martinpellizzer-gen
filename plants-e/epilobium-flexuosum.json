    "intro": "Epilobium flexuosum, commonly known as creeping willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is commonly found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, prostrate or ascending stems that can form dense mats, and its leaves are ovate to elliptic with a hairy surface. Its showy, pink to red flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom from late spring to early summer. Epilobium flexuosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
