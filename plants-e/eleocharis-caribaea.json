    "intro": "Eleocharis caribaea, commonly known as Caribbean spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to the Caribbean region. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface. Eleocharis caribaea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
