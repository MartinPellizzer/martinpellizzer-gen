    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis f. inundata, commonly known as the water spike rush, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, needle-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant's stems are typically elongated and often submerged, with small, spike-like clusters of flowers at the tips. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall herbaceous appearance. This variety is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in regions with seasonal flooding."
