It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and tufted inflorescences that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. It has a clumping growth habit and is adapted to seasonal flooding, making it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects. Its ornamental value has also led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes."
