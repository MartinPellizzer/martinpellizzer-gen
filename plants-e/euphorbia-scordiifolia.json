    "intro": "Euphorbia scordiifolia, commonly known as the garlic-leaved spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, garlic-scented leaves and yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It has a distinctive branching structure with thick, succulent stems that help it retain water. Euphorbia scordiifolia is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
