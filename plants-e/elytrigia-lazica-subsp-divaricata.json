    "intro": "Elytrigia lazica subsp. divaricata, commonly known as the Caucasian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a slightly hairy surface, while the flowers are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
