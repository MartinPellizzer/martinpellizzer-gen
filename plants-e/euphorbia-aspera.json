    "intro": "Euphorbia aspera, commonly known as the rough spurge, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its rough, often hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. Euphorbia aspera is often used in traditional medicine, though its applications are limited due to its toxic properties."
