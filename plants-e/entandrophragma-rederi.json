    "intro": "Entandrophragma rederi, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood with a high oil content, which contributes to its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has a straight trunk and can grow up to 30 meters tall, with large, palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody capsules containing elliptical seeds. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is valued for its timber in local and international markets."
