    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 vicinum, commonly known as the common willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks. Epilobium \u00d7 vicinum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
