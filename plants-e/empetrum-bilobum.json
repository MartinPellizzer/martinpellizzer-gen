    "intro": "Empetrum bilobum, commonly known as the two-lobed willow-herb, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters, and its flowers are tiny, greenish-white blossoms that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in harsh environments, such as rocky soils and tundra, due to its ability to tolerate extreme cold and poor nutrients. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in ecological successional stages, contributing to soil stabilization. Empetrum bilobum is also known for its medicinal properties in some traditional practices."
