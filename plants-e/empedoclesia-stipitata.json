    "intro": "Empedoclesia stipitata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Empedoclesia stipitata is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
