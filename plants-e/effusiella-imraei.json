    "intro": "Effusiella imraei, commonly known as the Indian velvet fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the humid forests of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Effusiella imraei is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
