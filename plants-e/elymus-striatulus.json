    "intro": "Elymus striatulus, commonly known as the stripegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive stripe pattern on the blade. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus striatulus is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
