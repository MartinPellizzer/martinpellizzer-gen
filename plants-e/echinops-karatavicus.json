    "intro": "Echinops karatavicus, commonly known as the Karatavicum thistle, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Echinops. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echinops karatavicus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
