    "intro": "Eugenia caryophyllifolia, commonly known as the clove tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown flowers and oval, leathery leaves with a distinctive clove-like scent. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically harvested when they are fully mature. The essential oil extracted from its flowers is a key component in the production of clove oil, widely used in perfumery and as a spice. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires full sunlight for optimal growth."
