    "intro": "Eremothera boothii subsp. decorticans, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects such as moths. The subspecies decorticans is distinguished by its unique leaf structure and flowering habits compared to other subspecies of Eremothera."
