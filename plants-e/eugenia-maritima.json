    "intro": "Eugenia maritima, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, often hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Eugenia maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
