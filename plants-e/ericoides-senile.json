    "intro": "Ericoides senile, commonly known as the silver hair vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often covered in a silvery, fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Ericoides senile is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and support biodiversity."
