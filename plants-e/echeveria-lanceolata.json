    "intro": "Echeveria lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tint. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
