    "intro": "Eriocaulon amphibium, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapting to its aquatic environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the water surface, often in clusters. Its roots help stabilize the sediment, contributing to the ecosystem's health. Eriocaulon amphibium is an important species for waterfowl and invertebrates in its habitat."
