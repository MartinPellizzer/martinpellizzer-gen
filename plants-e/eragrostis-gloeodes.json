    "intro": "Eragrostis gloeodes, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a valuable component of native grassland ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife further highlights its ecological importance."
