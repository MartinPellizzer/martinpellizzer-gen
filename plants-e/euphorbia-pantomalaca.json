    "intro": "Euphorbia pantomalaca, commonly known as the Pantomalaca spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
