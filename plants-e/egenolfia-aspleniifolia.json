    "intro": "Egenolfia aspleniifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that resemble those of true ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Egenolfia aspleniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
