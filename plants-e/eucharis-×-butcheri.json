It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its large, waxy, white flowers that resemble lilies. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a typical feature of aroids. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eucharis \u00d7 butcheri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking floral display."
