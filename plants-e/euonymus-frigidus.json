    "intro": "Euonymus frigidus, commonly known as the Arctic euonymus, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, spherical berries that persist into the winter. Euonymus frigidus is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate environments."
