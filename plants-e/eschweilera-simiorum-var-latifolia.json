It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often fragrant, followed by ornamental red fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests.
