    "intro": "Euphorbia varians, commonly known as the croton or spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that can vary in color from green to red or purple, depending on the environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia varians is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and unique floral structure."
