    "intro": "Ecclinusa psilophylla, commonly known as the slender-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, narrow leaves that give it a lacy appearance, typically growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds. It is often found in temperate regions with high humidity and is adapted to thrive in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ecclinusa psilophylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
