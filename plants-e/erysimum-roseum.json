The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has a mat-forming habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often slightly hairy as well. Erysimum roseum is known for its long blooming period, often extending from spring through early summer."
