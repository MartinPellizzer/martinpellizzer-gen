    "intro": "Elaeis guineensis f. caryolitica, commonly known as the dwarf coconut, is a botanical variant of the coconut palm characterized by its shorter stature and unique fruit morphology. It exhibits a compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental and small-space gardening. The plant produces smaller, more rounded fruits compared to the typical coconut, with a thicker husk and a higher oil content. It is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value and as a source of coconut oil. This variety is adapted to tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight for optimal growth."
