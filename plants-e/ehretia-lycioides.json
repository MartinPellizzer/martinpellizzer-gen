    "intro": "Ehretia lycioides, commonly known as the silky sycamore, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
