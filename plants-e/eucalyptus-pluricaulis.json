    "intro": "Eucalyptus pluricaulis, commonly known as the multi-stemmed eucalypt, is a tall, slender tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and white. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia."
