    "intro": "Eugenia coronata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed myrtle, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often larger than those of the typical Eugenia coronata. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic foliage and fruit."
