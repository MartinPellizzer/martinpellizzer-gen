    "intro": "Elaphoglossum palorense, commonly known as the Palorensis holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact rosette form. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the genus Elaphoglossum. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
