    "intro": "Elymus stebbinsii subsp. stebbinsii, commonly known as the Stebbins' needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid and semi-arid regions."
