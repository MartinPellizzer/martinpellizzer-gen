    "intro": "Eunanus brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. It produces a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Eunanus brevipes is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
