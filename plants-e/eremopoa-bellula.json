    "intro": "Eremopoa bellula, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eremopoa bellula is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resilience to poor soil conditions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and as a ground cover in xeriscaping."
