    "intro": "Echeveria xochipalensis, commonly known as the Mexican rose or blue echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a powdery coating known as farina. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
