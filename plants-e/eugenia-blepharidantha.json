    "intro": "Eugenia blepharidantha, commonly known as the red-leaf eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish in color as they mature. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, spherical berries that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understorey habitats within tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
