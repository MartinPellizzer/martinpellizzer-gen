    "intro": "Elymus cretaceus, commonly known as the chalk grass or sea grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Elymus cretaceus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insect and bird species."
