    "intro": "Eriocaulon sollyanum var. sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran star sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in its wetland habitat. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
