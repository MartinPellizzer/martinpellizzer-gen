    "intro": "Elymus antiquus, commonly known as ancient grass or old man's beard, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Elymus antiquus is often found in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
