    "intro": "Euphorbia meloformis var. prolifera, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its latex sap is milky and can be irritating, so it should be handled with care. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
