    "intro": "Eriogonum cognatum, commonly known as the Sierra goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum cognatum is often found in rocky slopes and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
