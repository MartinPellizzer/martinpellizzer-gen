    "intro": "Erythrina reticulata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves with three leaflets and produces pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Erythrina reticulata also has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion."
