    "intro": "Echinocarpus murex, commonly known as the spiny burr or wild burr, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, spiny fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in areas with warm climates. Its botanical features include palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruits, which are indehiscent and covered in sharp spines, aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
