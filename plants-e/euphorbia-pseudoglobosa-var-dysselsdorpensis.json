    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudoglobosa var. dysselsdorpensis, commonly known as the Dysselsdorp euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
