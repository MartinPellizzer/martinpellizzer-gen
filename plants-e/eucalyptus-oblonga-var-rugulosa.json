    "intro": "Eucalyptus oblonga var. rugulosa, commonly known as the rough-barked slender gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a rough texture, which is reflected in its varietal name. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which bloom in spring and attract native pollinators. This species is well adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
