    "intro": "Erythrodes brevicalcar, commonly known as the short-spurred erythrodes, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with bright red sepals and petals, often with a contrasting yellow lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
