It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
