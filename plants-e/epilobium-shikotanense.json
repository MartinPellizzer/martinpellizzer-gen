    "intro": "Epilobium shikotanense, commonly known as Shikotan willowherb, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Japan. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils near the shorelines. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Epilobium shikotanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
