It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with purple markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that produces a single flowering stem each year, often with several flower spikes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
