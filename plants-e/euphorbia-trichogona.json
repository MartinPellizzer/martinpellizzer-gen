    "intro": "Euphorbia trichogona, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia trichogona is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
