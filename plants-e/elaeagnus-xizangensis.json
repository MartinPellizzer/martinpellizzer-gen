    "intro": "Elaeagnus xizangensis, commonly known as the Tibet silverberry, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of Tibet and other parts of southwestern China. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, yellowish-green fruits that ripen in the autumn. The plant is adapted to cold and arid conditions, making it a hardy species found in alpine environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a source of food for local wildlife."
