    "intro": "Ehretia ferrea, commonly known as ironwood tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in racemes. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
