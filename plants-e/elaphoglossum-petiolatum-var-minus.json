    "intro": "Elaphoglossum petiolatum var. minus, commonly known as the small-stemmed holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, translucent indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a valuable species for studying fern biodiversity in tropical ecosystems."
