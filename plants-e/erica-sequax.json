    "intro": "Erica sequax, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Erica sequax is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
