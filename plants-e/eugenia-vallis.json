    "intro": "Eugenia vallis, commonly known as the valley guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to guavas. Eugenia vallis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
