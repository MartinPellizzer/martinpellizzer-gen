    "intro": "Eurybia gunniana var. phlogopappa, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
