    "intro": "Echinopsis calliantholilacina, commonly known as the lilac night-blooming cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of pink or lilac. Its nocturnal blooming habit is an adaptation to attract specific pollinators active during the evening hours. Echinopsis calliantholilacina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering display."
