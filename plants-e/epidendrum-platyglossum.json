    "intro": "Epidendrum platyglossum, commonly known as the broad-tongue orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, with a distinctive broad, tongue-shaped lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Epidendrum platyglossum thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires good air circulation for optimal growth."
