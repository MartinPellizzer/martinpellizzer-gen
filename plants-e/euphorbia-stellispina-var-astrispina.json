    "intro": "Euphorbia stellispina var. astrispina, commonly known as the star-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with spiny, ribbed structures that provide structural support and protection. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias. This variety is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
