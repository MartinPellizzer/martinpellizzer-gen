    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca subsp. spathulare, commonly known as the broadleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, ovate to spatulate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is notable for its drought tolerance and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
