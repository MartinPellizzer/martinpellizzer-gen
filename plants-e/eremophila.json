    "intro": "Eremophila, commonly known as the fairy fanflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants are typically shrubs or herbs, characterized by their narrow, linear leaves and showy, often tubular flowers. Eremophila species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them drought-tolerant and well-suited to coastal and sandy soils. Their flowers come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and purple, and they attract pollinators such as birds and insects. The genus includes over 120 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and resilience."
