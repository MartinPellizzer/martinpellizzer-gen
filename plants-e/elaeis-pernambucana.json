It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of yellowish flowers, which develop into elongated, fibrous fruits. The seeds within the fruits are encased in a hard, woody shell. This palm is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of palm oil."
