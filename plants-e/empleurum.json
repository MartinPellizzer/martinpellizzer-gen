    "intro": "Empleurum, commonly known as the \"spleenwort,\" is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a simple structure with a thallus that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a leaf-like structure called a phyllodium. Empleurum species are often found in humid climates and are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. These plants play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms."
