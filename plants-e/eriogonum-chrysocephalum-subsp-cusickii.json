It is characterized by its glandular, hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, yellowish pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow to golden-orange flowers in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
