    "intro": "Erica pallida, commonly known as the pale heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces delicate white or pale pink flowers in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Erica pallida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
