It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and used in traditional herbal medicine.
