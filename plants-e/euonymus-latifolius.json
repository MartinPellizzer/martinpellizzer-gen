    "intro": "Euonymus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. Euonymus latifolius is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
