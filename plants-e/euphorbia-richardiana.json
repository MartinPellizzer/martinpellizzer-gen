    "intro": "Euphorbia richardiana, commonly known as the Richard's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. Euphorbia richardiana is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
