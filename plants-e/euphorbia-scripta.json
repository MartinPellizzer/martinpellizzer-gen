    "intro": "Euphorbia scripta, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that are covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by specialized leaves called bracts. Euphorbia scripta thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is considered a hardy plant that is relatively low-maintenance once established."
