    "intro": "Ebermaiera nitida, commonly known as the white-leaved evergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
