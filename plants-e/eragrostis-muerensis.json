    "intro": "Eragrostis muerensis, commonly known as muer's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally used in landscaping and erosion control in dry environments."
