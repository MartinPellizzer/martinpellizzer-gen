    "intro": "Elemifera, commonly known as the sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Elemifera is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
