It is a small annual herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are narrow and hairy. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its delicate structure and rapid life cycle. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
