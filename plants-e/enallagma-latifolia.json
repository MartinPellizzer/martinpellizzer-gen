    "intro": "Enallagma latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf jewelwing, is a species of dragonfly found in wetland habitats across North America. It is characterized by its slender body and striking blue or turquoise wings, which are often iridescent in appearance. The plant is typically found near shallow, still waters with abundant vegetation, where it lays its eggs. Its larvae, known as naiads, develop in the water and undergo metamorphosis into adult dragonflies. Enallagma latifolia plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for larger animals."
