    "intro": "Escobaria abdita subsp. tenuispina, commonly known as the slender-stemmed jointfoot, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a thick, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush habitats."
