    "intro": "Elaphoglossum boquetense, commonly known as the Boquet's holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum boquetense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
