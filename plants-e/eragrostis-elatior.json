    "intro": "Eragrostis elatior, commonly known as tall false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Eragrostis elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry, open habitats."
