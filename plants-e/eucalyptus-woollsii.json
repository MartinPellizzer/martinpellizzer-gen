    "intro": "Eucalyptus woollsii, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are released in spring and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range. Eucalyptus woollsii is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in woodland and heathland ecosystems."
