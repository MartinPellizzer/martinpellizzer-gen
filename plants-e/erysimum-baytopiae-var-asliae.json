    "intro": "Erysimum baytopiae var. asliae, commonly known as the Asliae Wallflower, is a rare and striking member of the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vivid splash of color to its natural habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its ecological niche."
