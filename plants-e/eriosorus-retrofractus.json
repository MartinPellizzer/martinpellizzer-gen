    "intro": "Eriosorus retrofractus, commonly known as the backward-fructed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in small, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, often in clusters. Eriosorus retrofractus is relatively rare and is found in specific regions with particular microclimates that support its growth."
