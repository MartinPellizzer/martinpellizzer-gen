    "intro": "Euphorbia tetraceras, commonly known as the crocodile plant, is a succulent shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its branching structure and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that resemble the scales of a crocodile. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by a modified leaf called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
