    "intro": "Eucalyptus cadens, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a silvery-gray underlayer, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its essential oils used in medicinal and aromatic applications."
