    "intro": "Euphorbia hallii, commonly known as the Hall's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Euphorbia hallii is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. It is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap that can cause skin irritation."
