    "intro": "Echinocactus ottonis f. tenuispinus, commonly known as the narrow-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, sharp spines that are typically a pale yellow or greenish color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is prized for its unique morphology and is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
