    "intro": "Elaeodendron argan, commonly known as the argan tree, is a small, deciduous tree native to the semi-arid regions of Morocco. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fruit capsules containing oil-rich seeds. The argan oil extracted from its seeds is highly valued for its culinary and cosmetic uses. It plays a crucial role in the local ecosystem and is also important for the livelihoods of rural communities."
