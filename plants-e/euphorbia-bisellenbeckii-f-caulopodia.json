    "intro": "Euphorbia bisellenbeckii f. caulopodia, commonly known as the cushion euphorbia, is a unique variant of the species characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It forms low, mat-like structures with tightly packed, fleshy stems and leaves, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in dry conditions. This succulent is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils."
