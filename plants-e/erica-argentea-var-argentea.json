    "intro": "Erica argentea var. argentea, commonly known as silver heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like, silver-gray foliage that provides year-round visual interest and is highly drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
