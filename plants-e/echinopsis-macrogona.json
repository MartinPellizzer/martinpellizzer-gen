    "intro": "Echinopsis macrogona, commonly known as the giant echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia. It is characterized by its large, spiny stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking white or yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis macrogona is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
