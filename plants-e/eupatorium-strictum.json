    "intro": "Eupatorium strictum, commonly known as stiffstem goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, branching stems that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated margins and a rough texture. Small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late summer, forming dense, panicle-like inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
