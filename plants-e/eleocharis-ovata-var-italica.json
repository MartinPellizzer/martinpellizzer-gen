    "intro": "Eleocharis ovata var. italica, commonly known as the Italian spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, with small, spike-like clusters of white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
