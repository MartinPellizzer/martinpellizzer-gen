It features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions, preferring well-drained soil. Euphorbia occulta is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance."
