    "intro": "Eriosema sericeum, commonly known as the silky eriosema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and also bear a similar silvery pubescence. Eriosema sericeum is often found in grassy areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
