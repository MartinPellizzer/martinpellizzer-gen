    "intro": "Euphorbia densa subsp. densa, commonly known as the dense euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
