    "intro": "Euphorbia marilandica, commonly known as the Maryland spurge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling it."
