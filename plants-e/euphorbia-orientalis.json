    "intro": "Euphorbia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a thick, fleshy stem with a distinctive yellowish-green color and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring. The plant has milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
