It is a medium to tall tree, typically reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with a straight trunk and a spreading crown. The bark is smooth and often exhibits a grey or white color, shedding in strips as the tree matures. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. The flowers are small and white or pale blue, clustered in umbels, and attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds."
