    "intro": "Euphrasia schlagintweitii, commonly known as the Schlagintweit's eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes several parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Euphrasia schlagintweitii is often found growing in rocky soils and at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters."
