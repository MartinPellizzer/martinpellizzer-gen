    "intro": "Ebnerella rettigiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, making it a significant resource in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
