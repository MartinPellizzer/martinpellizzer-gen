It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in shades of greenish-white. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
