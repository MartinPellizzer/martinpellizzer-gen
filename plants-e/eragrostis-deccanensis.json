    "intro": "Eragrostis deccanensis, commonly known as the Deccan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It typically grows in dry, arid, and semi-arid regions, often found in open fields and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a potential candidate for land rehabilitation projects."
