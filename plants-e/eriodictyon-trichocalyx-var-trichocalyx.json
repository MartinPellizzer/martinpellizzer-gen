    "intro": "Eriodictyon trichocalyx var. trichocalyx, commonly known as California yerba santa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used by Native American communities for its anti-inflammatory and respiratory benefits."
