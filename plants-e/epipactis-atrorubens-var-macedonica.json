It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown flowers with a distinctive greenish throat, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has strap-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its complex pollination mechanisms involving specific insect species. This variety is rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
