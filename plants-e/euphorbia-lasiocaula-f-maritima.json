    "intro": "Euphorbia lasiocaula f. maritima, commonly known as the coastal euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salty, windy coastal environments. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens."
