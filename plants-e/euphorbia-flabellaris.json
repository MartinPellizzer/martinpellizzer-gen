    "intro": "Euphorbia flabellaris, commonly known as the glasswort euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia flabellaris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
