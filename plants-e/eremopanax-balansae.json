    "intro": "Eremopanax balansae, commonly known as the Balansae emerald tree, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its striking emerald-green leaves and unique branching pattern. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters in optimal conditions. Its botanical features include compound leaves with serrated edges and small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red berries. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in Madagascar."
