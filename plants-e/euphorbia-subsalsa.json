    "intro": "Euphorbia subsalsa, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
