It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical red blooms of the species. The plant is a legume, belonging to the family Fabaceae, and features compound leaves with three leaflets. It thrives in the moist, shaded environments of Hawaii's rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
