    "intro": "Eugenia alternifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and small, clustered white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
