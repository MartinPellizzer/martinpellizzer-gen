    "intro": "Eriocaulon lacteum, commonly known as the milkgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and grass-like foliage, with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is typically found in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in regions with high humidity. Eriocaulon lacteum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
