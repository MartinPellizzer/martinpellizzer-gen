    "intro": "Eupatorium probum, commonly known as white boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features erect, branching stems covered in white, fuzzy hairs, and it produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, opposite, and often have a rough texture. It is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties."
