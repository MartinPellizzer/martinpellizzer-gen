    "intro": "Erica denisoniana, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica denisoniana is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
