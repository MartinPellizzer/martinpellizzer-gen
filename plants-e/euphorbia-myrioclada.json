    "intro": "Euphorbia myrioclada, commonly known as the many-lobed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems and leaves that are often divided into numerous lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a modified leaf called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
