    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaerrhodos, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
