It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small white to pale yellow flowers in the summer months. Erigeron setulosus is often used in native plant gardens due to its ecological value and ornamental appeal."
