    "intro": "Eliokarmos thermophilus, commonly known as the thermophilic orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to high-temperature environments such as geothermal areas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that thrive in nutrient-rich soils. The plant exhibits specialized adaptations to withstand extreme heat, including thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its unique habitat requirements, Eliokarmos thermophilus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
