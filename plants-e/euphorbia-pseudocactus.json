    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudocactus, commonly known as the false cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often segmented and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect cyathia. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Euphorbia pseudocactus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
