    "intro": "Eriocaulon tuberosum, commonly known as the tuberous spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it forms tubers underground, which serve as storage organs. Its rhizomes and tubers are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures. Eriocaulon tuberosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
