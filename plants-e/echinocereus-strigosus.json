    "intro": "Echinocereus strigosus, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-covered plant with a branching structure that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and spines for protection against herbivores. Echinocereus strigosus is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for desert gardens."
