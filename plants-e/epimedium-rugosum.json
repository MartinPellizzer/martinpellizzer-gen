It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, matted foliage. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Epimedium rugosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
