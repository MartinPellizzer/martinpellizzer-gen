    "intro": "Epidendrum constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. It thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Epidendrum constrictum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
