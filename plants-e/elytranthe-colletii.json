    "intro": "Elytranthe colletii, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in high-altitude settings. Elytranthe colletii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with proper drainage."
