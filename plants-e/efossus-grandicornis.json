    "intro": "Efossus grandicornis, commonly known as the giant horned fern, is a unique and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant features prominent, horn-like spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered along the fronds. Efossus grandicornis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense rainforests. Its distinctive morphology makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts."
