    "intro": "Eupatorium trachyphyllum, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist woodland areas and along streambanks, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features opposite, rough-textured leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers in the late summer and early autumn. Its flowering period attracts various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
