    "intro": "Eucalyptus saligna var. botryoides, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a silver-gray underbark, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The tree produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody, cylindrical capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open forests or woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
