    "intro": "Epidendrum boothii, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange flowers and compact growth habit. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in dry environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum boothii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
