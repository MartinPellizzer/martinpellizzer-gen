    "intro": "Euphorbia atropurpurea var. modesta, commonly known as the compact sunset euphorbia, is a low-growing, compact shrub native to the western United States. It features striking, waxy, dark purple foliage that remains vibrant throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia (modified flowers) that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
