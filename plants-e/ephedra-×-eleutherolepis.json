    "intro": "Ephedra \u00d7 eleutherolepis, commonly known as the hybrid Ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, including ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. However, due to its potential for abuse and toxicity, it is now regulated in many regions."
