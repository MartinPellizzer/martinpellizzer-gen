    "intro": "Euphorbia tehuacana, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features succulent, branching stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and may be covered in fine hairs. Euphorbia tehuacana is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
