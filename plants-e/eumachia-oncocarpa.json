    "intro": "Eumachia oncocarpa, commonly known as the red-flowered rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing its ability to absorb nutrients from poor soils. Eumachia oncocarpa is often found in rocky, acidic habitats such as cliffs and woodland edges."
