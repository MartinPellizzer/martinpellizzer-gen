    "intro": "Eriogonum deflexum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the bentleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive, often curled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to harsh conditions."
