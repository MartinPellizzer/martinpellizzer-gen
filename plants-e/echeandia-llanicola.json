    "intro": "Echeandia llanicola, commonly known as the Llanilla or Llanilla grass, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Echeandia llanicola is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in degraded environments."
