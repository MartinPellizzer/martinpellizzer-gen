    "intro": "Echinocereus pacificus subsp. pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a dense cluster of cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red or orange fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
