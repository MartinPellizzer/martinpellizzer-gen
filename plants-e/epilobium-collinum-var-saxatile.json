    "intro": "Epilobium collinum var. saxatile, commonly known as the alpine willow herb, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features erect stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to reddish, clustered in dense spikes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in harsh environments."
