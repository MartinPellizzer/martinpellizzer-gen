    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides subsp. glebulosa, commonly known as the yellow-spined euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems covered in a waxy, pale green cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
