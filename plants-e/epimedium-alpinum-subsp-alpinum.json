    "intro": "Epimedium alpinum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine barbatan, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
