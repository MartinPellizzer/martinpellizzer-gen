    "intro": "Echinopsis mamillosa, commonly known as the Mexican night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Echinopsis mamillosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
