    "intro": "Epithecia ochracea, commonly known as the yellow-stained cup lichen, is a member of the family Trapeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen that forms thin, crust-like growths on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is yellowish to ochraceous in color, with a distinct, often lobed structure. The apothecia are small, with a smooth, pale to reddish-brown disc and a marginal ring that is usually yellow. This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is characterized by its unique chemical composition, including the presence of specific depsidones."
