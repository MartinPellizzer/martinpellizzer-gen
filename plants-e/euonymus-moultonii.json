    "intro": "Euonymus moultonii, commonly known as the Moulton's euonymus, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are often dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant's unique fruit color and adaptability contribute to its ecological and horticultural significance."
