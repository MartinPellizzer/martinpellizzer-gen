    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. moomomiana, commonly known as the Moon's Moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a swollen, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
