    "intro": "Euphorbia atlantica var. villosa, commonly known as the Atlantic euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features a compact growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its waxy leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, providing protection from intense sunlight and salt spray. This resilient species is well adapted to coastal conditions, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
