    "intro": "Epidendrum salpichlamys, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps in moisture retention. Epidendrum salpichlamys is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
