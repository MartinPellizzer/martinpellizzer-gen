    "intro": "Eucalyptus macarthurii, commonly known as the Macarthur's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
