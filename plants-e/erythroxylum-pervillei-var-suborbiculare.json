    "intro": "Erythroxylum pervillei var. suborbiculare, commonly known as the Peruvian coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elliptical, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves contain alkaloids, particularly cocaine, which has made it both botanically and economically significant. This variety is distinguished by its slightly rounded leaf base, setting it apart from other Erythroxylum species."
