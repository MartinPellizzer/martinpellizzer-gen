    "intro": "Eremophila glabra subsp. verrucosa, commonly known as the rough eremophila, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom during the winter months. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
