    "intro": "Elaeocarpus surigaensis, commonly known as the Philippine elaeocarpus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The tree produces small, woody fruits that are typically clustered in panicles, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
