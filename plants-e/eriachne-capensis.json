    "intro": "Eriachne capensis, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
