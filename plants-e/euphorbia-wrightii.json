    "intro": "Euphorbia wrightii, commonly known as Wright's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. Due to its water-storing tissues, it is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping."
