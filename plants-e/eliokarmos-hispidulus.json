It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
