    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium lusus ramigerum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cotton-grass, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Its unique appearance makes it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
