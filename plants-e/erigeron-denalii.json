    "intro": "Erigeron denalii, commonly known as Denali fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and northern Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the summer months. Erigeron denalii is adapted to harsh alpine environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
