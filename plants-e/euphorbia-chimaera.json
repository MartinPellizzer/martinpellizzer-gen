    "intro": "Euphorbia chimaera, commonly known as the \"Crimson Thorn\" or \"Fire Thorn,\" is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in sharp, spiny structures that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves, and small greenish-yellow true flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
