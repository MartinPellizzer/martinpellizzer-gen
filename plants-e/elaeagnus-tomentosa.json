    "intro": "Elaeagnus tomentosa, commonly known as silverthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas and parts of China. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and dense, thorny branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, red-orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Elaeagnus tomentosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
