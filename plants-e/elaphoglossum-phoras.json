    "intro": "Elaphoglossum phoras, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum phoras thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in suitable climates."
