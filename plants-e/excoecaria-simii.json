    "intro": "Excoecaria simii, commonly known as the African glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of bright yellow bracts surrounding small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
