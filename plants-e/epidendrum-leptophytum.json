    "intro": "Epidendrum leptophytum, commonly known as the slender leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum leptophytum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
