It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
