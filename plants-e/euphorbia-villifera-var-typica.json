    "intro": "Euphorbia villifera var. typica, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, spiny stems and leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap and spiny appearance, it is often avoided by herbivores and is considered a resilient, drought-tolerant species."
