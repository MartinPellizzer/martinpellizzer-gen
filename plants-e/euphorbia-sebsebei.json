    "intro": "Euphorbia sebsebei, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true blooms. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia sebsebei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
