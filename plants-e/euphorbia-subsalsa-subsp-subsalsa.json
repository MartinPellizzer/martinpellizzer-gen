    "intro": "Euphorbia subsalsa subsp. subsalsa, commonly known as the coastal euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features a low-growing, cushion-like structure with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, typically appearing in summer. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
