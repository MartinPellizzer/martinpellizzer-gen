    "intro": "Ernodea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, yellow to green pea-like flowers, which are clustered in racemes. Its trifoliate leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a shallow root system adapted to tidal environments. Ernodea littoralis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
