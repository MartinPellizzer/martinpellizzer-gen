    "intro": "Eriogonum bifurcatum, commonly known as the twin-branch buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum bifurcatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
