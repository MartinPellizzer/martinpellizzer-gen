    "intro": "Euphorbia scheffleri, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a dense, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a characteristic feature of the Euphorbia genus. Euphorbia scheffleri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
