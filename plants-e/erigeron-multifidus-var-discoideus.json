    "intro": "Erigeron multifidus var. discoideus, commonly known as the daisy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its daisy-like white ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and sandy soils. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. The leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant is often found in disturbed areas."
