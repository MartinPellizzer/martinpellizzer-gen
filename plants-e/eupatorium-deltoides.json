    "intro": "Eupatorium deltoides, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that resemble mist, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, while its stems are often hairy. Eupatorium deltoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like butterflies and bees."
