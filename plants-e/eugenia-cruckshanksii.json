    "intro": "Eugenia cruckshanksii, commonly known as the white eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understorey habitats of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
