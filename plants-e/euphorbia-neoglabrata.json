    "intro": "Euphorbia neoglabrata, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous upright, fleshy leaves that are smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by distinctive cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
