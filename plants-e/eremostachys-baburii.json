    "intro": "Eremostachys baburii, commonly known as the Afghan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, fluffy flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. Eremostachys baburii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
