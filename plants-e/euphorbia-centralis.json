    "intro": "Euphorbia centralis, commonly known as the Central American spurge, is a perennial shrub native to Central America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Euphorbia centralis is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
