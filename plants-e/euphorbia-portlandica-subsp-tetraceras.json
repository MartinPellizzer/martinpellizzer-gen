    "intro": "Euphorbia portlandica subsp. tetraceras, commonly known as the Portland euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the British Isles. It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is well adapted to coastal and calcareous soils, showing resistance to salt and wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native habitat."
