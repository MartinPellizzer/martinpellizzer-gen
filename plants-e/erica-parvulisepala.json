    "intro": "Erica parvulisepala, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. Erica parvulisepala is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and drought tolerance."
