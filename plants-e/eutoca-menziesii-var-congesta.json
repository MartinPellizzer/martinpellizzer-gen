    "intro": "Eutoca menziesii var. congesta, commonly known as the Pacific coast lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments along the western coast of North America. It has a distinct, leaf-like structure with a dense, compact growth pattern, giving it a fluffy or velvety appearance. The thallus is typically greenish-yellow to yellowish-green, with a central layer of algae and a protective outer cortex. It forms symbiotic associations with green algae, primarily *Trebouxia* species, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. This lichen is often found on bark, soil, and rocks in coastal rainforests, playing a role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization."
