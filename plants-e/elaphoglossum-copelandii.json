    "intro": "Elaphoglossum copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided, feathery appearance, characteristic of many ferns in the genus Elaphoglossum. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum copelandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded garden environments."
