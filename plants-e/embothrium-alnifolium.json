    "intro": "Embothrium alnifolium, commonly known as the Andean beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and its growth habit is typically upright and spreading. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. The berries are edible for birds and mammals but are generally considered unpalatable to humans."
