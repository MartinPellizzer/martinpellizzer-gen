    "intro": "Erophila vulgaris var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule, which is shorter and more compact compared to other varieties of Erophila vulgaris. This species is adapted to moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
