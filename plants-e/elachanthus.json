    "intro": "Elachanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its striking, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plants are typically small, herbaceous shrubs with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Elachanthus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Their unique floral structures and nocturnal blooming habits make them a subject of interest in both botanical and ecological studies."
