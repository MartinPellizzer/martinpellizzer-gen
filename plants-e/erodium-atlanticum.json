    "intro": "Erodium atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
