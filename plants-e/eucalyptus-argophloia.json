    "intro": "Eucalyptus argophloia, commonly known as the white gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in long strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
