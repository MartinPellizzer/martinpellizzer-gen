It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. Eutassa montana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions."
