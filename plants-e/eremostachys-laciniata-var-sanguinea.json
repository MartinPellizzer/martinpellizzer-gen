    "intro": "Eremostachys laciniata var. sanguinea, commonly known as the red-fruited eremostachys, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, often divided into narrow segments, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. Its flowers are typically pale blue to purple, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and bloom during the summer months. The plant produces small, red or orange fruits that are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
