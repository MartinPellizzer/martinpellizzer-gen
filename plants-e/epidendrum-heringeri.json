    "intro": "Epidendrum heringeri, commonly known as the Heringer's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water, helping it survive in dry periods. The flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
