    "intro": "Epimedium pinnatum subsp. circinatum, commonly known as the golden smock or the creeping barberry, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features attractive, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
