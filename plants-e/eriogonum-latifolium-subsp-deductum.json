    "intro": "Eriogonum latifolium subsp. deductum, commonly known as the broadleaf buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy and grayish in appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
