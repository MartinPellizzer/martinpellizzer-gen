    "intro": "Euphorbia proctorii, commonly known as the \"Cape Spurge,\" is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Namibia and South Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem, making it well adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia proctorii is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
