    "intro": "Epidendrum freireanum, commonly known as the Freire's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces pseudo-bulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red. Epidendrum freireanum is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic."
