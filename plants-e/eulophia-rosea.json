    "intro": "Eulophia rosea, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is an orchid native to the tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in soil, while its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation. Eulophia rosea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
