    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 stopfordii, commonly known as the Sydney peppermint, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender growth habit and smooth, grey-green bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a fragrant, peppermint-like aroma when crushed. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its essential oils in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
