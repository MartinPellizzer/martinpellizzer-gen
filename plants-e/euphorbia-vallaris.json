    "intro": "Euphorbia vallaris, commonly known as the Desert Holly, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branched stem system with fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
