    "intro": "Euacer laevifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved euacer, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its blooming period occurs from late spring to early fall, producing vibrant pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
