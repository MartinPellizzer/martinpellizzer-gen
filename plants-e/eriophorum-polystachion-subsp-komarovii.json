    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion subsp. komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
