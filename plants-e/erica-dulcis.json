    "intro": "Erica dulcis, commonly known as the sweet heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. Erica dulcis is evergreen, with dense, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
