    "intro": "Eleocharis mamillata subsp. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian sedge, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and damp meadows. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by water or wind, contributing to its distribution in wetland environments."
