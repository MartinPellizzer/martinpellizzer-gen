    "intro": "Encelia oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf encelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Encelia oblongifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
