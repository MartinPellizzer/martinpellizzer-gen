    "intro": "Eremophila retropila, commonly known as the red-flowered emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, tubular red flowers. The plant is adapted to low rainfall and high temperatures, with deep roots that allow it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Eremophila retropila is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
