    "intro": "Eudema hauthalii, commonly known as the Hauthal's eudema, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eudema hauthalii is considered a species of conservation concern."
