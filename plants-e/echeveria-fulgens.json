It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green with a powdery coating, giving it a frosty appearance. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces vibrant orange to red flowers in spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its color and shape."
