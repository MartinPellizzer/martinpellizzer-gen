    "intro": "Ericoila angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptic to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ericoila angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, hardy ground covers in suitable climates."
