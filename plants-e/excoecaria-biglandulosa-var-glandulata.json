    "intro": "Excoecaria biglandulosa var. glandulata, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elongated leaves that are often waxy and have a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It is commonly cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions. The plant's latex sap, which is milky and sticky, is also a notable botanical trait."
