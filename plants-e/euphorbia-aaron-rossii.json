    "intro": "Euphorbia aaron-rossii, commonly known as Aaron's rod, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features spiny, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant has a distinctive crown of short, thick leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
