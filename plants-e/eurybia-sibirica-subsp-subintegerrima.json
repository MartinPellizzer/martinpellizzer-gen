    "intro": "Eurybia sibirica subsp. subintegerrima, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, supporting clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The leaves are basal, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh, arctic conditions. It blooms from late summer to early autumn, producing nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. This subspecies is notable for its resilience in low-nutrient, well-drained soils and its role in alpine and tundra ecosystems."
