It thrives in brackish and freshwater environments, typically found in coastal marshes and estuaries. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate varying salinity levels, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
