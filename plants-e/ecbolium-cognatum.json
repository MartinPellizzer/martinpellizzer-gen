    "intro": "Ecbolium cognatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf ecbolium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescence, while its flowers range in color from pink to white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
