    "intro": "Epipactis rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is usually reddish or brownish in color. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Epipactis rubiginosa is also notable for its mycorrhizal associations, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil."
