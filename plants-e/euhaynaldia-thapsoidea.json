    "intro": "Euhaynaldia thapsoidea, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in the monsoon season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
