    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris var. arenaria, commonly known as sand spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and coastal environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils and is often found in marshes, shorelines, and tidal areas. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to fluctuating water levels and saline conditions."
