    "intro": "Elatostema umbellatum var. involucratum, commonly known as the woolly false shamrock, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The varietal name 'involucratum' refers to the hairy, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower clusters."
