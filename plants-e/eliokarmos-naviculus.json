    "intro": "Eliokarmos naviculus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, helping to stabilize the substrate and improve water clarity. Eliokarmos naviculus is often found in still or slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes."
