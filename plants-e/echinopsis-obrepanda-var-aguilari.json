    "intro": "Echinopsis obrepanda var. aguilari, commonly known as the Aguilari's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines, providing protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments. The varietal name 'aguilari' refers to the botanist who first described it, highlighting its significance in botanical classification."
