    "intro": "Elymus pectinatus, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with lemmas that are bristly and sometimes hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Elymus pectinatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
