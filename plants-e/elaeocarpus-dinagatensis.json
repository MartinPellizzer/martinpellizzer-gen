    "intro": "Elaeocarpus dinagatensis, commonly known as the Dinagat elaeocarpus, is a rare tree species endemic to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that are typically red or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in lowland to montane forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
