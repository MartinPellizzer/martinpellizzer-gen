    "intro": "Erodium absinthoides amanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and possesses trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across its native range."
