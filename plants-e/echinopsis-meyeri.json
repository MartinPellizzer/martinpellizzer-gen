    "intro": "Echinopsis meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis meyeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and hardy nature."
