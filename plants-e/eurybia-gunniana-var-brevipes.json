    "intro": "Eurybia gunniana var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features upright, branched stems that are typically shorter than the standard variety of Eurybia gunniana. The plant produces small, yellow to golden-orange flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats like meadows and forest edges."
