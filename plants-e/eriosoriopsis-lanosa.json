    "intro": "Eriosoriopsis lanosa, commonly known as the woolly rust fungus, is a species of rust fungus that primarily affects plants in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, powdery, yellowish-orange spore masses that appear on the underside of infected leaves. The fungus produces a unique type of rust called a \"winter rust,\" which overwinters on infected plant debris. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in temperate regions. The presence of Eriosoriopsis lanosa can lead to significant leaf discoloration and defoliation in susceptible host plants."
