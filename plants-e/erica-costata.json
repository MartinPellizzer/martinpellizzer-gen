    "intro": "Erica costata, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Erica costata is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray and coastal winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
