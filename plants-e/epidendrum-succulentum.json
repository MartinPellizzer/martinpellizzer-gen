    "intro": "Epidendrum succulentum, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ethereal appearance. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and requires high humidity and good drainage. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
