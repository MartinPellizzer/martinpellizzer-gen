It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold and arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Elymus pycnanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
