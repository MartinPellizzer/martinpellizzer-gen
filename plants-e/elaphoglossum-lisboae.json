    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lisboae, commonly known as the Lisbon holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the montane forests of Portugal. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum lisboae is considered a species of conservation concern."
