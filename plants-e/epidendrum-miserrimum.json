    "intro": "Epidendrum miserrimum, commonly known as the sad orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It features thin, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with small, pale green to white flowers that have a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
