    "intro": "Echinopsis arachnacantha subsp. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur-horned cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered with white or yellow spines. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as moths and bats. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and desert gardens."
