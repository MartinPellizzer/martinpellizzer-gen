    "intro": "Epidendrum oblongatum, commonly known as the long-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum oblongatum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
