    "intro": "Encephalartos altensteinii var. paucidentatus, commonly known as the few-toothed cycad, is a rare and distinctive member of the Zamiaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, strap-shaped leaves. Its cones are typically small and inconspicuous, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
