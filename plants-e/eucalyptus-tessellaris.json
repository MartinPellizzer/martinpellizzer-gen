    "intro": "Eucalyptus tessellaris, commonly known as the tessellated gum, is a tall, slender tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, tessellated strips, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to coastal and sandy soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
