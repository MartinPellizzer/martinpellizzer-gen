    "intro": "Euphorbia bejariensis, commonly known as the Bejari spurge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically grouped in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional medicine practices."
