    "intro": "Elymus australis, commonly known as the coastal wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often root at the base. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically light green to brown in color. Elymus australis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
