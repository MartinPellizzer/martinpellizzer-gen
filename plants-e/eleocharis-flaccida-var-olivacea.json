    "intro": "Eleocharis flaccida var. olivacea, commonly known as the olive flat sedge, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and marsh ecosystems. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a tendency to droop, contributing to its common name. The olive flat sedge plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
