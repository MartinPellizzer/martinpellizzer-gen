    "intro": "Erica pilosiflora, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves covered in a fine, woolly coating. Erica pilosiflora produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation, a unique biome in the Cape region of South Africa."
