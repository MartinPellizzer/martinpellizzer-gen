    "intro": "Epipactis chloidophylla, commonly known as the yellow helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves and a single, showy yellowish-green flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Epipactis chloidophylla is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
