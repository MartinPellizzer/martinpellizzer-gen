    "intro": "Eltroplectris brachycentron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Eltroplectris brachycentron is often found in swampy habitats and is adapted to periodic flooding."
