    "intro": "Epipactis palustris lusus ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy yellowish-green flower spike. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in environments with partial shade. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This orchid is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland areas, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem."
