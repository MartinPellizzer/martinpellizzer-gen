    "intro": "Eremophila tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for dryland gardens. Its small, tubular flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. Eremophila tenella is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soils."
