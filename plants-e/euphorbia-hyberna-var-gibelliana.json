    "intro": "Euphorbia hyberna var. gibelliana, commonly known as the Irish spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint, adapted to retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
