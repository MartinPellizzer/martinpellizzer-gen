    "intro": "Encephalartos delucanus, commonly known as the Delucan's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the cycad family, known for their primitive characteristics and gymnosperm nature. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy bark. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow, leathery leaflets that are often twisted or curled. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
