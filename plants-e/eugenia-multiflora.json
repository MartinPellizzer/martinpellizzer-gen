    "intro": "Eugenia multiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or small-leaved eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The berries are edible but are typically used in local cuisines or for making jams and beverages."
