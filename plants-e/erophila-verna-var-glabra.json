    "intro": "Erophila verna var. glabra, commonly known as smooth white speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with fine, silky hairs, which give it a soft, velvety texture. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly toothed margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks."
