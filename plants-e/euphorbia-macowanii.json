    "intro": "Euphorbia macowanii, commonly known as the Macowan's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem system with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures rather than true flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
