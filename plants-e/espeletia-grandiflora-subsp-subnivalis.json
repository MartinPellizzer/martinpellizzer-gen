    "intro": "Espeletia grandiflora subsp. subnivalis, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its rosette growth pattern allows it to retain heat and protect its core from freezing temperatures. This subspecies is adapted to subnival conditions, thriving in areas with persistent snow cover."
