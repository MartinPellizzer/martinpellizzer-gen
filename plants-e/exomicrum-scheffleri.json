    "intro": "Exomicrum scheffleri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are often reduced to spines to minimize water loss. Exomicrum scheffleri is typically found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
