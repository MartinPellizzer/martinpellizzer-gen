    "intro": "Elettariopsis smithiae var. rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved elettariopsis, is a lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, rugose leaves that give it its varietal name, rugosa. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are often white or pale yellow. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
