It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, three-lobed seeds that are often mistaken for rice grains. It thrives in moist, tropical climates and is commonly found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Eleusine arabica is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
