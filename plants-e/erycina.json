    "intro": "Erycina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include long, slender roots and a single, erect stem with a few leaves. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Erycina is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
