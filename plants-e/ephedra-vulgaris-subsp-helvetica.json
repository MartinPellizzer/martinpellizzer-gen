    "intro": "Ephedra vulgaris subsp. helvetica, commonly known as the Swiss ephedra, is a shrub native to the Alps and parts of Central Europe. It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are typical features of the Ephedra genus. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and reddish-brown seed pods, which contain the seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has been the subject of scientific and regulatory interest."
