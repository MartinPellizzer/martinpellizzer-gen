It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of leaves around the stem, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Euchylia verticillata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
