    "intro": "Eritrichium filiforme, commonly known as the threadleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with slender, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Eritrichium filiforme is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a characteristic species of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem."
