    "intro": "Echinops viridifolius, commonly known as the greenleaf thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble those of other echinops species. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive seed heads. Echinops viridifolius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
