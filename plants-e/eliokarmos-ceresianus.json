    "intro": "Eliokarmos ceresianus, commonly known as the Cerusan starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eliokarmos ceresianus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
