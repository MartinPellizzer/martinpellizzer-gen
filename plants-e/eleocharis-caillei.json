    "intro": "Eleocharis caillei, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a species of sedges native to parts of Africa, including Madagascar and the Comoros. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Eleocharis caillei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
