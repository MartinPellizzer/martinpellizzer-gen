    "intro": "Eremophila maculata, commonly known as the spotted emu plant, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant produces vibrant purple or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Eremophila maculata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
