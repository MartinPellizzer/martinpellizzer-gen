It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features slender, aromatic stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. It is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
