    "intro": "Erodium praecox var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored bedstraw, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its slender stems are often prostrate or ascending. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. The species is notable for its ability to spread via seeds and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
