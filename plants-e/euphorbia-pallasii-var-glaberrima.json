    "intro": "Euphorbia pallasii var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
