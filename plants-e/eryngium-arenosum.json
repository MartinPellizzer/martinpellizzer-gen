    "intro": "Eryngium arenosum, commonly known as the sand eryngo, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States. It features spiny, blue-green foliage and produces striking, thistle-like blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eryngium arenosum is often found in disturbed sites and is adapted to full sun and low moisture conditions."
