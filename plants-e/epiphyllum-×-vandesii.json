    "intro": "Epiphyllum \u00d7 vandesii, commonly known as the night bloomer or Christmas cactus, is a hybrid cactus species native to Central America. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often mistaken for leaves, though they are actually modified stems. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically open at night, hence its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epiphyllum \u00d7 vandesii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
