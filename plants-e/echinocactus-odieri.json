    "intro": "Echinocactus odieri, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Echinocactus odieri is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
