    "intro": "Echinocereus stolonifer subsp. tayopensis, commonly known as the Tays Peninsula cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mound-forming cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense coating of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, spherical fruits. It has adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct morphological and genetic traits compared to other members of the Echinocereus genus."
