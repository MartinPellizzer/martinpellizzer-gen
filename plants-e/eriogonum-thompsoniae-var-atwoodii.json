The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has hairy, gray-green foliage and produces small, oval-shaped seeds. This variety is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soils."
