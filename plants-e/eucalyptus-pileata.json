    "intro": "Eucalyptus pileata, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-blue foliage, which consists of small, rounded leaves that resemble silver coins. The bark of this species is typically smooth and white or pale grey, often peeling in thin strips. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This plant is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
