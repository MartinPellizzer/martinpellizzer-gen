It is characterized by its erect growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features basal and some stem leaves that are pinnately lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is often found in the wild along rocky slopes and walls."
