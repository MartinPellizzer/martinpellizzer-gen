    "intro": "Eugenia brachyclada, commonly known as the broad-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
