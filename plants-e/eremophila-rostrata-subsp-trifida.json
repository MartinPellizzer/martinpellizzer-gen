    "intro": "Eremophila rostrata subsp. trifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. It is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for gardens and restoration projects."
