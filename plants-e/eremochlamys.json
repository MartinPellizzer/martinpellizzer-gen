    "intro": "Eremochlamys, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia. They are characterized by their woody stems, which help them survive in harsh, dry environments. The flowers are typically showy, with five petals and a prominent central spur, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Eremochlamys species are often used in traditional medicine and have adapted to store water in their thick leaves and stems."
