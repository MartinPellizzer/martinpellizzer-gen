    "intro": "Erodium cedrorum, commonly known as the clustered charlock, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are pinnately lobed with a distinctive appearance. It produces small, round seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
