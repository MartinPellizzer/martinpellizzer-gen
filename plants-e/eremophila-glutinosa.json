    "intro": "Eremophila glutinosa, commonly known as sticky eremophila, is a shrub native to Australia, particularly found in the southern regions. It is characterized by its narrow, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The flowers are typically pink or red, arranged in spikes, and bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
