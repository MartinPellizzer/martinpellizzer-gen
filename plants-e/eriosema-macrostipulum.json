    "intro": "Eriosema macrostipulum, commonly known as the broad-stippled eriosema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features hairy stems and leaves with distinctive, broad stipules that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are opposite and often have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Eriosema macrostipulum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
