    "intro": "Eugenia cordillerana, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and its showy, fragrant pink or white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are dark red to black in color, which are a food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Eugenia cordillerana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
