    "intro": "Elaphoglossum microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the undersides of its fronds. Elaphoglossum microlepis is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas."
