    "intro": "Elymus ambiguus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often loosely arranged along its stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Elymus ambiguus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
