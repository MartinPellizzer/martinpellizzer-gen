    "intro": "Erica flocciflora, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica flocciflora is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
