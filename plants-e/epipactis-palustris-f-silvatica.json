    "intro": "Epipactis palustris f. silvatica, commonly known as the forest marsh helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland and forested areas in Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a showy, greenish-yellow flower spike that typically blooms in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in peat bogs or along the edges of streams. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
