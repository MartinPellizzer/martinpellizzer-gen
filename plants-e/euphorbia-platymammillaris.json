    "intro": "Euphorbia platymammillaris, commonly known as the White-spined Milkweed, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in white tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
