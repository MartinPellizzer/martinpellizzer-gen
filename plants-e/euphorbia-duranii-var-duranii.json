    "intro": "Euphorbia duranii var. duranii, commonly known as the Duran's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central America. It features a distinctive, branched stem structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the growing season, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and collections."
