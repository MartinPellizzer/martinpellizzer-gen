    "intro": "Eryngium maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the shores of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads surrounded by silver-green bracts. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in salty, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Eryngium maritimum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
