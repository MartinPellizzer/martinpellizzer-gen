    "intro": "Eleocharis \u00d7 myogiensis, commonly known as the hybrid spikerush, is a wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Eleocharis acutiformis and Eleocharis yokohamae. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true flowers, instead producing small, inconspicuous spikelets. This species is often found in marshy areas and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
