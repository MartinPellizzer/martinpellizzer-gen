    "intro": "Erechtites glomeratus var. subincisus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goldenweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a distinct subincised margin, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
