It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
