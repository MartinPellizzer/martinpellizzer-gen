    "intro": "Euphorbia reptans, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features succulent, fleshy stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Euphorbia reptans is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common ornamental plant in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
