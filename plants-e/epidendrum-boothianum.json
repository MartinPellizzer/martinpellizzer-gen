    "intro": "Epidendrum boothianum, commonly known as the Booth's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and large, showy flowers that can be pink, red, or orange in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and it requires good air circulation and moderate watering. The flowers bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
