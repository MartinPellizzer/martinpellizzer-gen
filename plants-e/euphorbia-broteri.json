    "intro": "Euphorbia broteri, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched, woody stems that often have a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia broteri is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is also noted for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
