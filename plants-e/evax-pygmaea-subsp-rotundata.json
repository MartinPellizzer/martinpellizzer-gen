    "intro": "Evax pygmaea subsp. rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
