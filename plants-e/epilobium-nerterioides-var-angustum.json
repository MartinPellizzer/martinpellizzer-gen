    "intro": "Epilobium nerterioides var. angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pinkish-red petals, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
