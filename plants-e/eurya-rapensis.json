    "intro": "Eurya rapensis, commonly known as the Chinese holly or Chinese waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Eurya rapensis thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. Its compact growth habit and year-round foliage make it a popular choice for hedging and container gardening."
