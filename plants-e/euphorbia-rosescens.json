    "intro": "Euphorbia rosescens, commonly known as the pink spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with a pale pink or reddish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster known as a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia rosescens is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
