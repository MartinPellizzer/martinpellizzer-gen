    "intro": "Eriogonum sarahiae, commonly known as Sarah's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its clustered, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum sarahiae is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
