    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudotuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its roots can become tuberous, which helps it store nutrients and water. Euphorbia pseudotuberosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry environments."
