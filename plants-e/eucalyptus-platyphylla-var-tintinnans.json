    "intro": "Eucalyptus platyphylla var. tintinnans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringybark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The tree produces small, globular white flowers that appear in late winter to early spring, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its bark is typically fibrous and peels in long, stringy strips, giving it its common name. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands."
