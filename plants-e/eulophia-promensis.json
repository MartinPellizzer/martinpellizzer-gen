    "intro": "Eulophia promensis, commonly known as the Prominent Eulophia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or near streams. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Eulophia promensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or botanical gardens."
