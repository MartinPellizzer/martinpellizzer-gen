It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. It is an important component of the local flora, supporting various wildlife species."
