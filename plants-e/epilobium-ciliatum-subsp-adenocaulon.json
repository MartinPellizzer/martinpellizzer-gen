    "intro": "Epilobium ciliatum subsp. adenocaulon, commonly known as the woolly willow or creeping willow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and stem structure."
