    "intro": "Erodium vetteri, commonly known as the velvetleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Africa. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in suitable habitats."
