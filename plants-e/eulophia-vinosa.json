    "intro": "Eulophia vinosa, commonly known as the wine orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often along stream banks or in rocky crevices. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive, elongated lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. Eulophia vinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
