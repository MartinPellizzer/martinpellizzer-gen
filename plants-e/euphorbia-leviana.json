    "intro": "Euphorbia leviana, commonly known as the Canary Islands spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
