It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, colorful foliage that changes with the seasons. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in various climates."
