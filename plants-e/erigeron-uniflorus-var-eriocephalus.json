It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils. The variety eriocephalus is distinguished by its particularly hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its drought tolerance."
