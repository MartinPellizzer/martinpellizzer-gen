    "intro": "Eleocharis grisea, commonly known as the gray spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clusters of grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to the ecological health of wetland ecosystems. Eleocharis grisea is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions."
