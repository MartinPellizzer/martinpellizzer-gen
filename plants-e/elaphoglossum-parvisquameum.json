    "intro": "Elaphoglossum parvisquameum, commonly known as the small-scales holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a pale green to silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
