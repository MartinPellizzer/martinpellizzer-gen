    "intro": "Encephalartos tegulaneus subsp. tegulaneus, commonly known as the Natal knobbed cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne in a short, branched inflorescence. It is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
