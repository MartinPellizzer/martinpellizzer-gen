    "intro": "Epipactis minipurpurata, commonly known as the small purple helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its striking, violet-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and moths, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
