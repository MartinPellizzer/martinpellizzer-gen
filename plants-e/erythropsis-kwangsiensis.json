    "intro": "Erythropsis kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi erythropsis, is a rare flowering plant native to southern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
