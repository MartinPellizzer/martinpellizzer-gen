    "intro": "Exostema valenzuelae subsp. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf exostema, is a rare bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers, which are typical of the Bromeliaceae family. Its leaves are adapted to collect and store water, a crucial feature for survival in its humid, high-altitude habitat. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller foliage compared to other members of the Exostema genus."
