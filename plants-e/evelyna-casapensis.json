    "intro": "Evelyna casapensis, commonly known as the Casapensian orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Evelyna casapensis is considered a vulnerable species."
