    "intro": "Erica denticulata var. retusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in coastal environments."
