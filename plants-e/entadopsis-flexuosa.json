    "intro": "Entadopsis flexuosa, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its helically twisted stems that allow it to coil around supports as it grows. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Entadopsis flexuosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to create dense, living cover in shaded environments."
