It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
