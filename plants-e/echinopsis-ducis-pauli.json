    "intro": "Echinopsis ducis-pauli, commonly known as the Pauli's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a single, large, white to pale blue flower that blooms at night. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help it store water and survive in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is highly valued in both horticulture and botanical research."
