It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
