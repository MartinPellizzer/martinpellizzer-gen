    "intro": "Euphorbia thi var. subinarticulata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems with a distinctive ribbed structure that helps store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
