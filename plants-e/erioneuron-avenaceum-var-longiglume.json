    "intro": "Erioneuron avenaceum var. longiglume, commonly known as the longglume grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often elongated and covered in silky, hairy structures. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called caryopses. This variety is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
