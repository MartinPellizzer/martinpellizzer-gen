It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in shades of white or pale green. Elatostema lagunense plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for microorganisms."
