    "intro": "Eucalyptus kumarlensis, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of central Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that is typically grey or pale brown in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a dense covering of hairs. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. This species is well adapted to drought and is often found in open woodlands and on sandy soils."
