    "intro": "Eremophila gibbosa, commonly known as the woolly emu bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, grey-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are usually red or pink, with a tubular shape that attracts nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eremophila gibbosa is part of the Myrtaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in native landscapes."
