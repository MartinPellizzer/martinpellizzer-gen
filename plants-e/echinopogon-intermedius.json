    "intro": "Echinopogon intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to wet environments, with a robust root system and a compact growth form."
