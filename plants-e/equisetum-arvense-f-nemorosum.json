    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. nemorosum, commonly known as the wood horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its growth is often associated with nutrient-rich soils. The species is considered a primitive plant with features similar to early land plants."
