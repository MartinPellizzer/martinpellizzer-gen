    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides var. pseudoafricana, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white powder. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
