    "intro": "Epilobium deflexum, commonly known as the bent willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features slender, willow-like stems that are often bent or drooping, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spikes. Epilobium deflexum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
