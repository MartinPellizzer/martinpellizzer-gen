    "intro": "Elymus macrourus var. pilosivaginatus, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
