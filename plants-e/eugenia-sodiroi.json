    "intro": "Eugenia sodiroi, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Eugenia* species, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries, hence its common name. Eugenia sodiroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
