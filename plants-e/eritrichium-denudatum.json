    "intro": "Eritrichium denudatum, commonly known as the naked eritrichium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Eritrichium denudatum is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates."
