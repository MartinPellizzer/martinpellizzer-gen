    "intro": "Epidendrum dendrobioides, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Epidendrum dendrobioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
