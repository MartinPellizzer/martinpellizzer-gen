    "intro": "Erythranthe bergeri, commonly known as the Sierra goldcup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the flowering plant family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Erythranthe bergeri is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun."
