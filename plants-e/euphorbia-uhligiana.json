    "intro": "Euphorbia uhligiana, commonly known as the Schomburgk's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Central and South America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and resilience. However, it contains toxic milky sap, so caution is advised when handling it."
