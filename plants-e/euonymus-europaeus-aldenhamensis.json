    "intro": "Euonymus europaeus aldenhamensis, commonly known as Aldenham euonymus, is a rare subspecies of the common euonymus. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and conservationists."
