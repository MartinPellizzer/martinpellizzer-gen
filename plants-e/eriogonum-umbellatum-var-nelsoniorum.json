    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. nelsoniorum, commonly known as Nelson's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and open woodlands, and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and plays an important role in supporting local pollinators."
