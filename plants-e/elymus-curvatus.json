    "intro": "Elymus curvatus, commonly known as the curlleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, curling leaves and grows in a variety of habitats, including dry meadows and rocky slopes. The plant typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Elymus curvatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
