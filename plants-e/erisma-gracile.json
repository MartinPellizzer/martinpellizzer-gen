    "intro": "Erisma gracile, commonly known as the slender erisma, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Erisma gracile thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of the flora in its native environment."
