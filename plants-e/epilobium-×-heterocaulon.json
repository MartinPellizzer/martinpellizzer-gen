    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 heterocaulon, commonly known as the hybrid willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Epilobium angustifolium (narrow-leaf willow herb) and Epilobium palustre (marsh willow herb). The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as riverbanks and damp woodlands, and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are pink or red, arranged in dense spikes. Epilobium \u00d7 heterocaulon is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance."
