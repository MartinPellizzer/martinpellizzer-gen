    "intro": "Epidendrum erikae, commonly known as the Erik's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum erikae is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
