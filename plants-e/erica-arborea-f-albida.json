    "intro": "Erica arborea f. albida, commonly known as the white heath, is a rare and striking variant of the common heath. It is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and silver-white foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink during the spring. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its typically dry habitat. This unique form is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils."
