It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, grass-like blades and dense, compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in wet environments and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
