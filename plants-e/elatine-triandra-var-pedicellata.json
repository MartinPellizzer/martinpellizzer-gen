    "intro": "Elatine triandra var. pedicellata, commonly known as the slender waterwheel, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. The plant features delicate, whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas gradually. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
