    "intro": "Echinops chloroleucus, commonly known as the white thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are covered in white, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, woody fruit. Echinops chloroleucus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
