    "intro": "Epidendrum subnutans, commonly known as the hanging epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with long, arching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant has strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Epidendrum subnutans is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
