    "intro": "Eucalyptus coccifera var. viridifolia, commonly known as the green-leafed ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, which attract various pollinators. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a unique appearance. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-resistant species."
