    "intro": "Eurybia collina, commonly known as the eastern marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, basal, and often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from herbivores and moisture loss. Eurybia collina is often found in moist soils and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
