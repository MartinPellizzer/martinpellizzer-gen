    "intro": "Elodes aegyptica, commonly known as the Egyptian waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Africa and parts of Europe. It has long, flexible stems that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often branching at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found above the water surface. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, arranged in whorls around the stem. Elodes aegyptica is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes."
