It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Erophaca baetica is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
