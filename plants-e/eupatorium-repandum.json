    "intro": "Eupatorium repandum, commonly known as boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Boneset is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat fevers and digestive issues."
