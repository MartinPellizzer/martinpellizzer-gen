    "intro": "Eucalyptus sargentii subsp. onesis, commonly known as the Sargent's malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark and lanceolate, aromatic leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers, which are clustered in umbels. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in providing habitat for native wildlife."
