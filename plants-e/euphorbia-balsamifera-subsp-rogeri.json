    "intro": "Euphorbia balsamifera subsp. rogeri, commonly known as the Roger's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching out into a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is adapted to dry conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
