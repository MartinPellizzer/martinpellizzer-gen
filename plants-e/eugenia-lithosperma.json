    "intro": "Eugenia lithosperma, commonly known as the rock myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces dark blue to black berries, which are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Eugenia lithosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
