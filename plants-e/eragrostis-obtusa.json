    "intro": "Eragrostis obtusa, commonly known as broadleaf grass or broad-leaved lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Eragrostis obtusa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
