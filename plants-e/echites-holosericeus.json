    "intro": "Echites holosericeus, commonly known as the silky echites, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be difficult to grow outside its natural habitat."
