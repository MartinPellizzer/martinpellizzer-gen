    "intro": "Epipactis ovata var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature of the varietal name. It is known for its ability to thrive in woodland soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
