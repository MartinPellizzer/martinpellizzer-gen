    "intro": "Elaphoglossum foeniculaceum, commonly known as the fern moss or slender spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate plant typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a creeping rhizome with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Elaphoglossum foeniculaceum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
