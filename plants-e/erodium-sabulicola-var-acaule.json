It typically features a sprawling habit with small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its succulent stems and leaves. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies in dryland environments."
