    "intro": "Echinocactus fordii, commonly known as the Ford's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed structure and spiny, greenish-gray stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible fruits. Echinocactus fordii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
