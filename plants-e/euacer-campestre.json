    "intro": "Euacer campestre, commonly known as the field euacer, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows and along woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
