    "intro": "Elymus nikitinii, commonly known as Nikitin's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppe and rocky soils. Elymus nikitinii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
