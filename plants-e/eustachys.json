    "intro": "Eustachys, commonly known as the grass genus, includes several species that are widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions. These plants are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Many species of Eustachys are used in horticulture for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage and flowering structures. They typically thrive in well-drained soils and require full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Some species are also valued for their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in natural habitats."
