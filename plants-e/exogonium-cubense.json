    "intro": "Exogonium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban exogonium, is a rare species of flowering plant native to Cuba. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as an exogonium. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
