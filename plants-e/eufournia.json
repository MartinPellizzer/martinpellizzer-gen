    "intro": "Eufournia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eufournia is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and invasive potential."
