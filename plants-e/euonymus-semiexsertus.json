    "intro": "Euonymus semiexsertus, commonly known as the semi-exserted woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, woodsy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use in shaded landscapes."
