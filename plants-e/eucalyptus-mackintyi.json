    "intro": "Eucalyptus mackintyi, commonly known as the Mackinty's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that displays a range of colors from white to pink. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a grey-green hue and a leathery texture. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
