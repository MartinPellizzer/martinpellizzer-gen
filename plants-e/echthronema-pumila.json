    "intro": "Echthronema pumila, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Echthronema pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations."
