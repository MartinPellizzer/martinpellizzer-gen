    "intro": "Elaphoglossum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to high-altitude regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The fronds are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its specialized habitat, Elaphoglossum alpinum is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
