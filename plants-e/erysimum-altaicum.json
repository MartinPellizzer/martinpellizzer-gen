    "intro": "Erysimum altaicum, commonly known as the alpine mustard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Erysimum altaicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
