    "intro": "Epidendrum trianguliferum, commonly known as the triangular leaf epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in racemes, often during the summer months. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Epidendrum trianguliferum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
