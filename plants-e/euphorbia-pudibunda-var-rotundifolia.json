    "intro": "Euphorbia pudibunda var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
