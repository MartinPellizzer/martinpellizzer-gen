It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by orange to yellow, juicy berries in late summer. The fruit is edible, with a sweet-sour flavor, and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is widely cultivated for its ornamental and fruit-bearing qualities."
