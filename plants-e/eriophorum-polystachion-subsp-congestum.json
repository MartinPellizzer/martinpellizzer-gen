    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion subsp. congestum, commonly known as the dense tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs, fens, and wet meadows. Its leaves are grass-like, slender, and often have a waxy coating. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
