    "intro": "Elaphoglossum blepharoglottis, commonly known as the veined holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum blepharoglottis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
