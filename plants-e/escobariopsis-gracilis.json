    "intro": "Escobariopsis gracilis, commonly known as the slender escobariopsis, is a small, delicate lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically crustose and grows on bark or soil in temperate regions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary photosynthetic function. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is relatively uncommon in the wild. Due to its fragile nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
