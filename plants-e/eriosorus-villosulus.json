    "intro": "Eriosorus villosulus, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in the soil and absorb nutrients effectively. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sorus."
