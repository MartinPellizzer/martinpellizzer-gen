    "intro": "Ephedra major var. procera, commonly known as the tall ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often branched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Ephedra major var. procera is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its historical use in traditional medicine has led to significant botanical and pharmacological interest."
