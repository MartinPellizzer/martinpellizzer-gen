    "intro": "Eurya sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian eurya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually evergreen, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It is characterized by its small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Eurya sandwicensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
