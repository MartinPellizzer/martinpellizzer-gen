    "intro": "Elaphoglossum resiniferum, commonly known as the resinous holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing in dense forests at high altitudes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum resiniferum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
