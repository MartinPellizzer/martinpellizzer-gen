    "intro": "Elytrigia geniculata subsp. scythica, commonly known as Scythian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization."
