    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. loreyi, commonly known as leafy spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of oval, dark green leaves and produces yellowish-green, cup-shaped flowers. The plant contains a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, making it a potential allergen. It is an invasive species in North America, particularly in the western United States, where it competes with native vegetation. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought conditions contributes to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
