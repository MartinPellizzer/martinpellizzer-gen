    "intro": "Epallage longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed epallage, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, wiry stems that can grow several meters in length, often climbing or trailing along the forest floor. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a delicate, fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epallage longipes is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
