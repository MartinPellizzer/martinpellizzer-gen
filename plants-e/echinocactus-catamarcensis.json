    "intro": "Echinocactus catamarcensis, commonly known as the Catamarca cactus, is a species native to Argentina. It is a spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features a cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and produces yellow flowers during the spring. It is well adapted to survive in drought conditions due to its thick, fleshy stems that store water. This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
