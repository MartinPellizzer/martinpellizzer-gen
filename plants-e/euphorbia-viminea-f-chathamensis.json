    "intro": "Euphorbia viminea f. chathamensis, commonly known as the Chatham Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has adapted to the harsh coastal environment with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
