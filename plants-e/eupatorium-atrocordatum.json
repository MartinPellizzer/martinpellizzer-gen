    "intro": "Eupatorium atrocordatum, commonly known as black snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its showy, clustered white to pale purple flowers appear in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
