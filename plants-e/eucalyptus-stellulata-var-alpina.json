    "intro": "Eucalyptus stellulata var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a ghostly appearance. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its unique visual characteristics."
