It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called a cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant."
