    "intro": "Enkianthus serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated enkianthus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and delicate floral display. Enkianthus serrulatus is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
