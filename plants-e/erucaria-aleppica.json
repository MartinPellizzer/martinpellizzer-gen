    "intro": "Erucaria aleppica, commonly known as the Aleppo pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are often arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds enclosed in a woody husk, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The Aleppo pine plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
