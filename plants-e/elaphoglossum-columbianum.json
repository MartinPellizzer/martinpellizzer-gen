    "intro": "Elaphoglossum columbianum, commonly known as the Colombian harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, harts-tongue-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant is native to the Andes mountains in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Elaphoglossum columbianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
