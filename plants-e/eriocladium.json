    "intro": "Eriocladium, commonly known as the silky tree, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, soft, and silky-hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plants typically have alternate, simple leaves that are often glandular and covered in fine hairs. Eriocladium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often surrounded by bracts."
