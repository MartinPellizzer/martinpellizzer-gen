    "intro": "Echinodorus palifolius var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet broadleaf waterweed, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It features long, broad, and slightly hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant thrives in slow to moderately fast water currents and prefers nutrient-rich substrates. It is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life. Its growth habit makes it suitable for both foreground and midground planting in planted tanks."
