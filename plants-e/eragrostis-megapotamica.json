    "intro": "Eragrostis megapotamica, commonly known as the Andes grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions, including the Andes. Eragrostis megapotamica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and aesthetic qualities."
