    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem, which is often reddish in color. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and clustered in elongated spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
