    "intro": "Echinocactus concinnus var. tabularis, commonly known as the Mexican flat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often flattened at the base, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
