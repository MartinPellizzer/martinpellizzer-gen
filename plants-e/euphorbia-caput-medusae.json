    "intro": "Euphorbia caput-medusae, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, or thickened stem, that resembles a crown, with numerous spiny branches radiating outward. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
