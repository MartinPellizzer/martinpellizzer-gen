    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucoxylon var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey to white bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, which contributes to its ornamental value. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, typically in spring, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for landscaping in dry climates."
