    "intro": "Erythrodes merrillii, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red petals and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its unique coloration and morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
