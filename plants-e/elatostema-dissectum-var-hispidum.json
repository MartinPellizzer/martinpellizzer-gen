It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettles and related plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, dissected leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals."
