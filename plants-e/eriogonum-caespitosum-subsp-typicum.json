    "intro": "Eriogonum caespitosum subsp. typicum, commonly known as stickybunch sagewort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of arid region flora."
