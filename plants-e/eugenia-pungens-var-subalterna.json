It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed, giving off a subtle, spicy scent. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its dense foliage and ornamental value make it suitable for hedges, borders, or container planting."
