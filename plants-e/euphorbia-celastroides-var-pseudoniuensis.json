    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. pseudoniuensis, commonly known as the Shiny Euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in full sun with minimal water. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
