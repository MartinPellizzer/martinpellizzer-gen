    "intro": "Euphorbia pubescens var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, contributing to its overall compact appearance."
