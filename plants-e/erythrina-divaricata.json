    "intro": "Erythrina divaricata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has compound leaves with three leaflets and produces distinctive, three-chambered pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Erythrina divaricata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
