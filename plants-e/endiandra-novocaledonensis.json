    "intro": "Endiandra novocaledonensis, commonly known as the New Caledonian endiandra, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in humid, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests of the region. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
