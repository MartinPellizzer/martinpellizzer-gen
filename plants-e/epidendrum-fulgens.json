    "intro": "Epidendrum fulgens, commonly known as the fiery torch orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, vivid orange to red flowers that bloom in dense, showy clusters. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Epidendrum fulgens is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
