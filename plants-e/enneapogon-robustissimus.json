    "intro": "Enneapogon robustissimus, commonly known as the stiff bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and dense, fibrous root system. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in panicles, with bristle-like awns that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant or for erosion control."
