    "intro": "Echinocarpus hederaerhiza, commonly known as the climbing echinocarp, is a tropical vine native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spiny, spherical fruits that are typical of the Echinocarpus genus. Its fruits are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
