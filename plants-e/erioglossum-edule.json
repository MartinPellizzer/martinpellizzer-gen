    "intro": "Erioglossum edule, commonly known as the edible erioglossum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in glandular structures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments. The plant is notable for its edible leaves, which have been traditionally used in local cuisines for their mild, slightly peppery flavor."
