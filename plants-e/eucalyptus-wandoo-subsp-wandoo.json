    "intro": "Eucalyptus wandoo subsp. wandoo, commonly known as the wandoo, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. It produces small, globular flower spikes in shades of white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The species is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native range."
