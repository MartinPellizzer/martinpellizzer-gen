    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. subracemosa, commonly known as yellow euphorbia, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive yellowish-green stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
