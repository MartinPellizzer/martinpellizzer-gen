    "intro": "Erythrocephalum humile, commonly known as the small-headed everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Erythrocephalum humile is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
