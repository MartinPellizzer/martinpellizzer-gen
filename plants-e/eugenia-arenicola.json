    "intro": "Eugenia arenicola, commonly known as the sand eugenia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Eugenia arenicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
