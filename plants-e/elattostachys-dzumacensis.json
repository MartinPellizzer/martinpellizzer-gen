    "intro": "Elattostachys dzumacensis, commonly known as the Dzumacensis fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes various types of ferns and mosses. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elattostachys dzumacensis is considered a vulnerable species."
