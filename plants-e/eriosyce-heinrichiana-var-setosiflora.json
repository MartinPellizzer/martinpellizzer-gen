    "intro": "Eriosyce heinrichiana var. setosiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered eriosyce, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and a compact, globular shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid and high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
