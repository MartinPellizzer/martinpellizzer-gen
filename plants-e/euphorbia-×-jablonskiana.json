    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 jablonskiana, commonly known as the hybrid spurge, is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ability to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often the only visible part of the inflorescence. It is native to regions with arid or semi-arid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested or in contact with skin."
