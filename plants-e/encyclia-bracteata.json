    "intro": "Encyclia bracteata, commonly known as the bractless orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of a single, showy flower per stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the bright colors of its flowers. The orchid's flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
