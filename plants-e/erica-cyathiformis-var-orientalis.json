It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to coastal and Mediterranean climates."
