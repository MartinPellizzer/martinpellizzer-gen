    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine var. minor, commonly known as the lesser helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces a single, erect stem bearing a single, spurred orchid flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
