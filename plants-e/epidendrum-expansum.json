    "intro": "Epidendrum expansum, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum expansum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
