    "intro": "Echeveria neglecta, commonly known as the Desert Carpet, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces vibrant pink or magenta flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with ample sunlight. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
