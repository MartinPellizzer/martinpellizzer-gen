    "intro": "Euphorbia kaessneri, commonly known as the Blue Glow Euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, blue-green foliage with a powdery coating that gives it a unique, almost glowing appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
