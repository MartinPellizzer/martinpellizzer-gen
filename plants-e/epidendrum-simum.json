    "intro": "Epidendrum simum, commonly known as the Showy Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, supporting the plant's growth and storage of water and nutrients. The flowers are borne on terminal inflorescences, often appearing in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
