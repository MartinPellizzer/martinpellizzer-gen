    "intro": "Eriogonum nudum var. indictum, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy, brush-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. This species is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
