    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. cognatum, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are linear and hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to arid environments."
