    "intro": "Elliottia, commonly known as the Florida hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southeastern United States. It consists of two species, Elliottia rotundifolia and Elliottia racemosa, both characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Elliottia plants thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in wetlands or along stream banks. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife."
