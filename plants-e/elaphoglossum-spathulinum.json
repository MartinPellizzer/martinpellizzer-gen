    "intro": "Elaphoglossum spathulinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. Elaphoglossum spathulinum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of understory vegetation in tropical and subtropical regions."
