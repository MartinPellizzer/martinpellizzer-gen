    "intro": "Eugenia meyeriana var. depauperata, commonly known as the poorleaf eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features simple, elliptical leaves that are typically small and leathery, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a specimen plant."
