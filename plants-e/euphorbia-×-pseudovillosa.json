    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 pseudovillosa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a hybrid shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
