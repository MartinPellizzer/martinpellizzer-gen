    "intro": "Endlicheria arachnocome, commonly known as the spider-tailed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features long, thin stems ending in a cluster of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
