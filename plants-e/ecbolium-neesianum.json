    "intro": "Ecbolium neesianum, commonly known as the New Zealand rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Ecbolium neesianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
