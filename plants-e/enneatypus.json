    "intro": "Enneatypus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plants typically grow as small trees or shrubs, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Enneatypus species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. These plants are adapted to harsh environments, making them important components of their native ecosystems."
