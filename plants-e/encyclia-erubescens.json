    "intro": "Encyclia erubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually elongated and can vary in color from green to reddish tones. Encyclia erubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable climate."
