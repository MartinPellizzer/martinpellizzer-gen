    "intro": "Elynanthus arenarius, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has finely divided leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. Elynanthus arenarius plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
