It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found growing along shorelines and in brackish water areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are succulent and can store water. Elutheria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
