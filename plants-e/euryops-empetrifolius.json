    "intro": "Euryops empetrifolius, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Euryops empetrifolius is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
