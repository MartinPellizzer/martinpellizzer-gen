    "intro": "Erica discolor var. puberula, commonly known as the rough heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has wiry, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, compact ground covers in suitable climates."
