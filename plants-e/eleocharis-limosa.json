    "intro": "Eleocharis limosa, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a wetland plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, often in shallow water or saturated soil. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Eleocharis limosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
