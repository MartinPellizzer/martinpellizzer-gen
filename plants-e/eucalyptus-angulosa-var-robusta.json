    "intro": "Eucalyptus angulosa var. robusta, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
