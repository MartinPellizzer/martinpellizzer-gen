    "intro": "Eragrostis retinens var. pergaminensis, commonly known as the parchmentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often described as having a parchment-like texture, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in drought conditions."
