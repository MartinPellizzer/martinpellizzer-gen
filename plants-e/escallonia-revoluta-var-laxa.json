    "intro": "Escallonia revoluta var. laxa, commonly known as the looseleaf escallonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or red flowers in spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt and wind. The varietal form 'laxa' is distinguished by its looser foliage compared to the typical variety."
