    "intro": "Eulophiella \u00d7 rolfei, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Eulophiella alpina and Eulophiella rothschildiana. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
