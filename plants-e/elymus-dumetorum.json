    "intro": "Elymus dumetorum, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Elymus dumetorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
