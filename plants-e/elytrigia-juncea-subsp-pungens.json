    "intro": "Elytrigia juncea subsp. pungens, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance, it serves as a food source for various insects and is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
