    "intro": "Eriogonum breedlovei, commonly known as the Breddle's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrublands. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Eriogonum breedlovei plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small desert organisms."
