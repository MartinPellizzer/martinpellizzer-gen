    "intro": "Elaphoglossum oreophilum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Elaphoglossum oreophilum is often found in montane regions, where its adaptability to high-altitude conditions makes it a notable component of the local flora."
