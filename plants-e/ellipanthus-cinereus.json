    "intro": "Ellipanthus cinereus, commonly known as the gray sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue or lavender flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, grayish-white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to desert and semi-desert conditions. The plant is often found in sandy or rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
