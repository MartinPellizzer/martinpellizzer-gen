It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often with a yellow or greenish throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.
