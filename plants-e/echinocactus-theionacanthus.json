It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and indoor cultivation."
