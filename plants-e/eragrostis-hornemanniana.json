    "intro": "Eragrostis hornemanniana, commonly known as the hornemannian grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate poor soil fertility. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
