    "intro": "Epidendrum raniferum var. hexadactylum, commonly known as the Orchid with Six Fingers, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks, with a pseudobulb structure that supports its growth. The plant produces long, slender leaves and is notable for its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. Its unique floral morphology, characterized by six prominent staminodes, gives it its common name. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive in cultivation."
