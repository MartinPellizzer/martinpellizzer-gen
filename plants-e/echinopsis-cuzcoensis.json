    "intro": "Echinopsis cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant produces spiny, ribbed stems that help it store water in its arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its nocturnal blooming habit makes it a unique and striking addition to any succulent collection."
