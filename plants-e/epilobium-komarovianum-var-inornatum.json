    "intro": "Epilobium komarovianum var. inornatum, commonly known as the unadorned willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often wet habitats such as marshes and riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, pink to reddish, and arranged in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
