    "intro": "Erica accommodata var. ebracteata, commonly known as the leafless heath, is a compact shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
