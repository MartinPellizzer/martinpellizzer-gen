    "intro": "Eucalyptus caesia subsp. magna, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a species native to the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue and a rough, felt-like texture. It produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from yellow to red, and it is often found in moist, temperate forest environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
