    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. polystachyon, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and jointed stems. The plant is typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a lack of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures."
