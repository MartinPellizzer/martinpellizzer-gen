    "intro": "Eugenia calciscopulorum, commonly known as the rock myrtle, is a shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, dark blue or black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
