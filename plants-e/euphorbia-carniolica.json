    "intro": "Euphorbia carniolica, commonly known as the Carniola spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features a short, thick stem with paired, fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a distinctive cyathium, which is a cup-like structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Euphorbia carniolica is known for its drought tolerance and ability to store water in its leaves and stem."
