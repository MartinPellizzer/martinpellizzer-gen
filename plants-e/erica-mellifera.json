    "intro": "Erica mellifera, commonly known as the honey heather, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, low-growing shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Erica mellifera is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It is also a source of nectar for bees, contributing to its common name."
