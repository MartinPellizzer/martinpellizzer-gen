    "intro": "Eucalyptus grisea, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears grey or brown, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear in late summer to autumn. Eucalyptus grisea is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in woodland and heathland ecosystems. It plays an important role in providing habitat for native wildlife and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
