It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, paper-like layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent white midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to yellow in color. This species is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
