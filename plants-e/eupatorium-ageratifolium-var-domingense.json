    "intro": "Eupatorium ageratifolium var. domingense, commonly known as the Dominican boneset, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
