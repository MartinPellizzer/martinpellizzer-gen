    "intro": "Ehrharta tasmanica, commonly known as Tasmanian grass or silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often concealed within the leaf sheaths, making it less showy than other grasses. Ehrharta tasmanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
