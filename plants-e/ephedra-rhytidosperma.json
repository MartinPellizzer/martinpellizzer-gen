    "intro": "Ephedra rhytidosperma, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Ephedra rhytidosperma is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a slow growth rate. It is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine, although its use is regulated due to the presence of ephedrine."
