    "intro": "Eriocaulon congolense, commonly known as the Congo bulbous sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
