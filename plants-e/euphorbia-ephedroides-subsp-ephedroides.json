    "intro": "Euphorbia ephedroides subsp. ephedroides, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that help store water, adapted to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its growth form and morphology reflect its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
