    "intro": "Epidendrum binasum, commonly known as the Bicolor Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its strikingly contrasting green and white stripes on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year under proper care. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum binasum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
