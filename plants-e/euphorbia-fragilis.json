    "intro": "Euphorbia fragilis, commonly known as the brittle spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a branching stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often lobed and can vary in shape depending on environmental conditions. Euphorbia fragilis is also known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
