    "intro": "Euphorbia procera var. trichocarpa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. This species is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
