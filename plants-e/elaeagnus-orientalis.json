    "intro": "Elaeagnus orientalis, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery, leaf-like stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
