    "intro": "Eritrichium muriculatum, commonly known as the rough mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Eritrichium muriculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
