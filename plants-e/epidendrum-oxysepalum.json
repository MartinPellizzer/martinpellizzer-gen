    "intro": "Epidendrum oxysepalum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of long, showy sepals that are often brightly colored. The plant produces pendulous flower spikes with numerous small, fragrant blossoms that bloom in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic. Epidendrum oxysepalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
