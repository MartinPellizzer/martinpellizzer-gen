    "intro": "Erythrina moelebei, commonly known as the Natal flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has compound leaves with three leaflets, and its bark is often fissured and peeling. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. The seeds are enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
