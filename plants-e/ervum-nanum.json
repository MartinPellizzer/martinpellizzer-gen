    "intro": "Ervum nanum, commonly known as dwarf vetch, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters and features trifoliate leaves with small, yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Ervum nanum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to improve soil quality."
