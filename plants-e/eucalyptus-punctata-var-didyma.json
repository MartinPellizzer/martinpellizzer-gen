It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The flowers are usually small and arranged in clusters, producing a distinctive yellow-green color. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
