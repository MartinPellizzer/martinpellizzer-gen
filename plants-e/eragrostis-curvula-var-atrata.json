It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping and erosion control."
