    "intro": "Eminium intortum subsp. kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi's eminium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often hairy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or semi-arid habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
