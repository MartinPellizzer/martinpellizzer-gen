    "intro": "Euphorbia insulana var. minor, commonly known as the lesser Socotra cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its unique, spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
