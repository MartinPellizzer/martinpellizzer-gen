It is characterized by its lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a distinctive white underside, and its clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly on limestone-rich substrates, and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. It blooms from late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
