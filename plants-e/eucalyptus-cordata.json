It is native to Australia and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, often peeling bark. The plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus cordata is an important component of the Australian flora and plays a role in supporting local ecosystems."
