    "intro": "Euphorbia carniolica f. expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
