    "intro": "Elymus condensatus var. triticoides, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
