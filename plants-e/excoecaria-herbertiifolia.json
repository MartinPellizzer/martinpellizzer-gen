    "intro": "Excoecaria herbertiifolia, commonly known as the Herbert's croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and orange. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to pests, it requires careful maintenance in cultivation."
