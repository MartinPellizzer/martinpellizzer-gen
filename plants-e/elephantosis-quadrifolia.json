    "intro": "Elephantosis quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that often form a rosette at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically four-lobed, though this trait is rare and considered a symbol of good luck. The species is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and meadows."
