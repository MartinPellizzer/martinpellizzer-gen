    "intro": "Eremophila denticulata, commonly known as the toothed emu bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces spikes of bright red or pink flowers, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Eremophila denticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water environments."
