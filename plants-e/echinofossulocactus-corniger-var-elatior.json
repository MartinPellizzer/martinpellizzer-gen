    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus corniger var. elatior, commonly known as the Elatior Echinofossulocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in thick, ribbed segments and spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
