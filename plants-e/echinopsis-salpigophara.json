    "intro": "Echinopsis salpigophara, commonly known as the pink echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the warmer months. Its adaptations include succulent stems for water storage and a nocturnal blooming habit to conserve moisture. Echinopsis salpigophara is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal care when cultivated in suitable conditions."
