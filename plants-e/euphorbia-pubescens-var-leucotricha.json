    "intro": "Euphorbia pubescens var. leucotricha, commonly known as the white-haired spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in dense white or grayish hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
