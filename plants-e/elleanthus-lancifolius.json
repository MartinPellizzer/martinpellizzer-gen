    "intro": "Elleanthus lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elleanthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Elleanthus lancifolius is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
