    "intro": "Epicampes bourgaei var. grandis, commonly known as the giant desert lily, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This species is often found in rocky soils and plays an important role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
