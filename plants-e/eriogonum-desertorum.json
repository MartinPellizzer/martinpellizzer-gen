    "intro": "Eriogonum desertorum, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are usually white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Eriogonum desertorum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
