The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically unisexual and arranged in clusters. Its stems contain alkaloids, such as ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, showcasing its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
