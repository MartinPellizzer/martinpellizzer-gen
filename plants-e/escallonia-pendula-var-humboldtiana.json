    "intro": "Escallonia pendula var. humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's weeping escallonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features cascading clusters of bright red, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy foliage that provides a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. The variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in mild, temperate climates."
