    "intro": "Erythroxylum minutifolium, commonly known as the dwarf coca, is a small shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is a member of the Erythroxylaceae family, which includes other species known for their psychoactive properties. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
