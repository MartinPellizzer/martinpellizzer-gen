    "intro": "Epilobium erubescens var. suberecta, commonly known as the redstem willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and marshy areas. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, hence its common name. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs. The flowers are pink to red, arranged in spikes, and are pollinated primarily by insects."
