    "intro": "Etiosedum annuum, commonly known as peppergrass, is an annual flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round, red or black fruits that are edible and used in various culinary applications. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Peppergrass is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
