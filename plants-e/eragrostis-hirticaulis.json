    "intro": "Eragrostis hirticaulis, commonly known as hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, hairy inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Eragrostis hirticaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
