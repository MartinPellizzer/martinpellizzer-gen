    "intro": "Euphorbia caesaraugustana, commonly known as the Caesar Augustus spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a cylindrical stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white hairs. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens."
