    "intro": "Eriophorum scabriculme, commonly known as the rough cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine, rough hairs, contributing to its common name. Eriophorum scabriculme thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments."
