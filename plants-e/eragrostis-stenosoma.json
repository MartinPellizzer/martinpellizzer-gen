    "intro": "Eragrostis stenosoma, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Eragrostis stenosoma is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
