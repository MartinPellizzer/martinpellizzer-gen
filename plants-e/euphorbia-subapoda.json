    "intro": "Euphorbia subapoda, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a stem that is often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive bluish-green color. Euphorbia subapoda is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
