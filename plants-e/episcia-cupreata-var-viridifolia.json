    "intro": "Episcia cupreata var. viridifolia, commonly known as the green-leaf wax plant, is a strikingly ornamental species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that range from deep green to coppery tones, with a waxy texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens."
