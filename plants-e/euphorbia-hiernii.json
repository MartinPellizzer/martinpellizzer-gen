    "intro": "Euphorbia hiernii, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may be spiny, contributing to its defensive adaptations. Euphorbia hiernii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
