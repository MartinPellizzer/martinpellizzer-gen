    "intro": "Eragrostis barrelieri var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf beardgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its compact size and resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
