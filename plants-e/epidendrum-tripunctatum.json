    "intro": "Epidendrum tripunctatum, commonly known as the Three-Dotted Vanda, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, dark green leaves with three distinct white or yellow spots, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Epidendrum tripunctatum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
