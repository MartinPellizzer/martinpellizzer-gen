    "intro": "Erigeron wightii, commonly known as the Wight's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage is usually gray-green and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Erigeron wightii produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
