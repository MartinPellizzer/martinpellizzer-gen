It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and aromatic, narrow leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Eucalyptus hendersonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
