    "intro": "Euonymus furfuraceus, commonly known as the roughleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in a distinctive, fuzzy pubescence, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Euonymus furfuraceus is relatively low maintenance and can tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
