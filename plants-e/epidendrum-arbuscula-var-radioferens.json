    "intro": "Epidendrum arbuscula var. radioferens, commonly known as the Radiant Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
