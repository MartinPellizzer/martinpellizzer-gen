    "intro": "Elaeagnus pungens f. rotundifolia, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. It is native to eastern Asia and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in dry, rocky areas. The plant has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets, which give it the 'rotundifolia' designation referring to its rounded leaf shape. It produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
