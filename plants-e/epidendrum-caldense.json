    "intro": "Epidendrum caldense, commonly known as the Caldense orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often in clusters. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, adapted to climbing and photosynthesis in shaded environments. Epidendrum caldense thrives in humid conditions with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media."
