    "intro": "Euphorbia marientalii, commonly known as the Mariental spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with upright, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster known as a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
