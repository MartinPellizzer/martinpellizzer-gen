    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. longirameum, commonly known as the long-stemmed willow herb, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a rough texture with a distinct midrib. Its flowers are pink to reddish, arranged in terminal clusters, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. This variant is distinguished by its longer stems compared to the typical form of Epilobium palustre."
