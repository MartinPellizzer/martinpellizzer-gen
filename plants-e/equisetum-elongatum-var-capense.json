    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. capense, commonly known as the Cape horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are typically found near the soil surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or woodland habitats. This variety is notable for its primitive morphology and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species."
