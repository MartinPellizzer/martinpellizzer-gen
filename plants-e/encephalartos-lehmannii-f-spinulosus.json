    "intro": "Encephalartos lehmannii f. spinulosus, commonly known as the spinulose rock cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, slow-growing form and its distinctive, spiny leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are typically a deep green and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand the dry, rocky environments it inhabits. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
