    "intro": "Elatostema poteriifolium, commonly known as the net-veined elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, commonly known as the nettle family, and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves with prominent venation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Elatostema poteriifolium is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
