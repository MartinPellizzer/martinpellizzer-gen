    "intro": "Eritrichium sajanense, commonly known as the Sajan mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
