    "intro": "Euphorbia lagunillarum, commonly known as the Lagunilla spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive, branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia lagunillarum is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
