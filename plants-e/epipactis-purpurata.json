    "intro": "Epipactis purpurata, commonly known as the purple helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and striking purple to reddish-brown flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with coniferous trees. It produces a single spike of flowers, which can reach up to 20 cm in height, and blooms from June to August. Epipactis purpurata is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and is considered a protected species in some regions due to its declining populations."
