    "intro": "Euphorbia polycnemoides, commonly known as the smooth-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, smooth spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling or planting this species."
