    "intro": "Epidendrum mixtum, commonly known as the green spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum mixtum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation."
