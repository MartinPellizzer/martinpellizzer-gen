    "intro": "Edmondia, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, spreading growth habit. Edmondia produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
