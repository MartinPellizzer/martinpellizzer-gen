    "intro": "Euonymus europaeus var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in early summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental planting. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes contribute to its aesthetic value in gardens."
