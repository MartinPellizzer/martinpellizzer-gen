It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.
