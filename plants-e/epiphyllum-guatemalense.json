    "intro": "Epiphyllum guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan night bloomer, is a climbing cactus native to Central America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, segmented stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale pink, opening at night and closing by dawn. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. Epiphyllum guatemalense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering behavior."
