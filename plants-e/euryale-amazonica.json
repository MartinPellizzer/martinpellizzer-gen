    "intro": "Euryale amazonica, commonly known as the Amazon water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems spread across the water, supporting the foliage. Euryale amazonica plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
