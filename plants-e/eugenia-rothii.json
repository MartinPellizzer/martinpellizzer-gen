    "intro": "Eugenia rothii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
