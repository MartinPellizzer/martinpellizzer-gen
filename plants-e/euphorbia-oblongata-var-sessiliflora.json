    "intro": "Euphorbia oblongata var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically small, rounded, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
