    "intro": "Epilobium angustifolium var. intermedium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a flowering plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and roadside areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
