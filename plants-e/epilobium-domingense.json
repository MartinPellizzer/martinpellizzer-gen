    "intro": "Epilobium domingense, commonly known as the Dominican willow, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, including the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Epilobium domingense is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and roadside areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
