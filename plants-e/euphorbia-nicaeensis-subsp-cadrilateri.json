    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis subsp. cadrilateri, commonly known as the four-angled euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive four-sided stems and thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a crown-like structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
