    "intro": "Eulophia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure with strap-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late winter to early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Eulophia pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
