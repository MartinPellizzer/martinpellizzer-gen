    "intro": "Eragrostis capillaris, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves that are covered with a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. Eragrostis capillaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
