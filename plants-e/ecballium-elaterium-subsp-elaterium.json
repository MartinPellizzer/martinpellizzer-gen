    "intro": "Ecballium elaterium subsp. elaterium, commonly known as the horse gall or blister bean, is a flowering plant in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, green fruit that resembles a small, elongated bladder. The fruit contains a single, hard-seeded pod and is covered in hooked hairs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
