    "intro": "Epistephium epiphyticum, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
