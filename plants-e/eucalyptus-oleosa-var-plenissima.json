It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white to grey pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy regions. The species is noted for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
