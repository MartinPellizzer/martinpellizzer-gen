    "intro": "Eulophia campbellii, commonly known as Campbell's eulophia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with erect, strap-like leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, and its flowers are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eulophia campbellii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
