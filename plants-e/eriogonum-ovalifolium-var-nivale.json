    "intro": "Eriogonum ovalifolium var. nivale, commonly known as the snow-flower buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in rocky soils and high elevations. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. This variety is often found in meadows and open areas where it contributes to local biodiversity."
