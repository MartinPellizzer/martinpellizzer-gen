    "intro": "Euphorbia monteiroi subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the Monteiro's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Brazil. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulent plants. The leaves are small, alternate, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This species is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
