    "intro": "Euphorbia menelikii, commonly known as the Menelik's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Ethiopia. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are often the only visible part of the inflorescence. It has a spiny stem and is known for its ability to store water in its fleshy tissues. Euphorbia menelikii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
