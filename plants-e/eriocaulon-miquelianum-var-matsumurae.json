    "intro": "Eriocaulon miquelianum var. matsumurae, commonly known as the Matsumura's marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
