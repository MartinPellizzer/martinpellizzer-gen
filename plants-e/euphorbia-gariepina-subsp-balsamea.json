It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
