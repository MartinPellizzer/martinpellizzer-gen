    "intro": "Elaeoselinum fontanesii, commonly known as the desert sandparsley, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Elaeoselinum fontanesii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
