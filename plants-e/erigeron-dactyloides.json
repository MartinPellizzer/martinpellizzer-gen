    "intro": "Erigeron dactyloides, commonly known as plains coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from yellow to pink. Erigeron dactyloides is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
