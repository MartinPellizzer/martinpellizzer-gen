    "intro": "Eragrostis eriopoda var. dubia, commonly known as the woolly fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in poor soils and drought conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open grasslands."
