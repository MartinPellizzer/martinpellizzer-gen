    "intro": "Eugenia hurlimannii, commonly known as the Hurlimann's eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential horticultural use. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests."
