    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli var. breviseta, commonly known as cocklebur grass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish spikelets that are often clustered in dense panicles. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a significant weed in cultivated areas."
