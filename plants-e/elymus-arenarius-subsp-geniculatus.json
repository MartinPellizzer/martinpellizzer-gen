    "intro": "Elymus arenarius subsp. geniculatus, commonly known as the sandgrass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically covered with fine hairs, while the inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
