    "intro": "Eucalyptus calcareana, commonly known as the limestone gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from grey to white, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular and aromatic. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium, and is commonly found in dry forests and woodlands. It produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. The species is notable for its adaptability to arid conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
