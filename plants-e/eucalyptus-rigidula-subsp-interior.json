    "intro": "Eucalyptus rigidula subsp. interior, commonly known as the interior rigid ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rigid, narrow leaves that are often blue-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin layers, revealing a pale, fibrous underlayer. This subspecies is well adapted to drought and is often found in open woodlands or on rocky outcrops."
