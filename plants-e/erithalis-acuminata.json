It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and bloom in early summer. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
