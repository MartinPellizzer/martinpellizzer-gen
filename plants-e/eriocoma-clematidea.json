    "intro": "Eriocoma clematidea, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in unstable mountainous terrain. Eriocoma clematidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
