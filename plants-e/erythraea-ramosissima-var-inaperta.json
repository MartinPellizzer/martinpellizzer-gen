    "intro": "Erythraea ramosissima var. inaperta, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and dense, aromatic wood, which has historically been highly valued for its use in furniture and incense. The plant exhibits a unique branching pattern and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red fruits. It thrives in arid, rocky environments and is adapted to the extreme climate of its native habitat. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
