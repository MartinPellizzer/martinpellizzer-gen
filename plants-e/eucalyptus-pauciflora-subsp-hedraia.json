    "intro": "Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. hedraia, commonly known as the snow gum, is a hardy evergreen shrub or tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats."
