    "intro": "Euphorbia tetraptera, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems that form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia tetraptera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
