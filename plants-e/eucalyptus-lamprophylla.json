It is characterized by its lance-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring rough, fibrous bark that peels in long strips. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. This plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
