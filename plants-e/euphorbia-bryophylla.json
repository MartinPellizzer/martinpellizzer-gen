    "intro": "Euphorbia bryophylla, commonly known as the rock fig or stone plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a modified leaf called a cyathium. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Euphorbia bryophylla is popular in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
