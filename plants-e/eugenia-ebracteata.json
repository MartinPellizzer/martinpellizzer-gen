    "intro": "Eugenia ebracteata, commonly known as the small-leaved guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, pinkish-red berries. Eugenia ebracteata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as understorey habitats in tropical forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
