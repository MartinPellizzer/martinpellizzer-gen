    "intro": "Eugenia grisea, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a spicy or peppery flavor. Eugenia grisea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, posing ecological challenges."
