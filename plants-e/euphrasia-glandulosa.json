    "intro": "Euphrasia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular eyebright, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its common name. Euphrasia glandulosa is often found in open, disturbed areas and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
