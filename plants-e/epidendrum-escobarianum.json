    "intro": "Epidendrum escobarianum, commonly known as the Escobaria orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often arranged in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum escobarianum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
