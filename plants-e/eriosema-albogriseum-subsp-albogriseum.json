It features a basal rosette of hairy, elliptical leaves that are pale green with a distinctive whitish or grayish coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
