    "intro": "Eleocharis macrorhiza, commonly known as spikegrass, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments across North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like appearance with slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland habitats. Eleocharis macrorhiza plays a vital role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife by providing habitat and food sources."
