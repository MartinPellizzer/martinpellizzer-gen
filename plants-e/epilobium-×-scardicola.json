    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 scardicola, commonly known as the scardicola willowherb, is a hybrid plant species within the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its erect or ascending growth habit and is typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as streambanks and wet meadows. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are usually alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs. Epilobium \u00d7 scardicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in wet conditions."
