    "intro": "Eulophia dentata, commonly known as the toothed eulophia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, tooth-like markings on the petals. Eulophia dentata typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a desirable species for both horticultural and ecological studies."
