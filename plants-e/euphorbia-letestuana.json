    "intro": "Euphorbia letestuana, commonly known as the Lesotho spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stem for survival. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
