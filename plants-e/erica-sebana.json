    "intro": "Erica sebana, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica sebana is part of the Ericaceae family, which includes many evergreen shrubs and subshrubs. Its botanical features make it well-suited for coastal landscapes and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
