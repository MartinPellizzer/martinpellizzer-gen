    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus var. mojavensis, commonly known as the Mojave prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp. This variety is well adapted to desert conditions, with a deep root system and a slow growth rate."
