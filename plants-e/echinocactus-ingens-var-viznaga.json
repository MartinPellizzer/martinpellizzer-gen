    "intro": "Echinocactus ingens var. viznaga, commonly known as the Mexican giant cardoon, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its large, ribbed, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its size and slow growth, it is often cultivated in arid climates as a showy ornamental plant."
