    "intro": "Echinocereus lindsayi, commonly known as Lindsay's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with spiny, ribbed stems that typically grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its structure and appearance make it a distinctive and popular ornamental plant in desert gardens."
