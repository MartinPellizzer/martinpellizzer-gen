    "intro": "Echinops sphaerocephalus f. microcephalus, commonly known as the dwarf globemallow, is a compact, drought-tolerant perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a short, upright stem with small, spiny bracts that form a spherical shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small size and ornamental value make it suitable for rock gardens and containers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
