    "intro": "Eulychnia eburnea, commonly known as the white-flowered cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly showy and often covered in a fibrous sheath. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
