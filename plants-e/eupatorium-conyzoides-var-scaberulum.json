    "intro": "Eupatorium conyzoides var. scaberulum, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in stiff, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, sandpapery texture, which contributes to its common name. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as swamps and stream banks."
