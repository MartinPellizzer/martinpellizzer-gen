    "intro": "Eriogonum saxatile var. crocatum, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
