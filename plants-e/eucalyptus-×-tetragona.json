    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 tetragona, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Its bark is usually smooth and peels in strips, and the wood is lightweight and aromatic. Eucalyptus \u00d7 tetragona is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands."
