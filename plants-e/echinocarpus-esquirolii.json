    "intro": "Echinocarpus esquirolii, commonly known as the African burr or wild burr, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that resemble small, round burrs. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. Its fruit capsules are often used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive due to their sticky properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
