    "intro": "Erica tetralix var. mackayi, commonly known as Mackay's heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in heathland and moorland environments. The plant features compact, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, hardy ground cover. This variety is closely related to the broader Erica tetralix species, which is part of the Ericaceae family."
