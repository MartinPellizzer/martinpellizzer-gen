    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum f. opsistachyum, commonly known as the forest horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are distinctive and cone-like. This fern-like form is a relic from the Paleozoic era and exhibits unique botanical features that set it apart from other equisetum species."
