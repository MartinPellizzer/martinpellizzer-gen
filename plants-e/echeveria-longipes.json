    "intro": "Echeveria longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of vibrant pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. Echeveria longipes is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
