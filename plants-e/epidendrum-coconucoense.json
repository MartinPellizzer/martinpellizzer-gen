    "intro": "Epidendrum coconucoense, commonly known as the Coconuco orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central America. It belongs to the Epidendraceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering stems. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, making it well-suited to shaded, moist environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
