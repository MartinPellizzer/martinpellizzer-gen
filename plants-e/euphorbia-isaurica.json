    "intro": "Euphorbia isaurica, commonly known as the Isaurian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, glandular-stalked leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires care to avoid skin irritation."
