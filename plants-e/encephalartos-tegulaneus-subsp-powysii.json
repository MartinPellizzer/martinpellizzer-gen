    "intro": "Encephalartos tegulaneus subsp. powysii, commonly known as the Powys cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like foliage composed of thick, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces a single, slender, yellowish-green cone that is typically pollinated by specific insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a humid, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly threatened in the wild."
