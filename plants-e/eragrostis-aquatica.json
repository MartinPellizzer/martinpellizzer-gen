    "intro": "Eragrostis aquatica, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, it is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers."
