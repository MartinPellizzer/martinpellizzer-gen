    "intro": "Elatine nodosa, commonly known as the nodose waterwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense spikes, with four petals and numerous stamens. Elatine nodosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed water bodies, making it a common indicator of nutrient-rich habitats."
