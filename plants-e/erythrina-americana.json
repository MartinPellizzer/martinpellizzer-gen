    "intro": "Erythrina americana, commonly known as the American coral tree, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers, which are typically clustered in racemes. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Its woody stem is often branched and can grow into a small tree or shrub. Erythrina americana is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
