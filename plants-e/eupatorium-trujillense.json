    "intro": "Eupatorium trujillense, commonly known as the Trujillo eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale blue. Eupatorium trujillense is valued for its potential traditional medicinal uses, though further research is needed to confirm its pharmacological properties."
