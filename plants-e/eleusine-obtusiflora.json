    "intro": "Eleusine obtusiflora, commonly known as broadleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to dry, open habitats. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in certain environments."
