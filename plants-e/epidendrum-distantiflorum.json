    "intro": "Epidendrum distantiflorum, commonly known as the distant-flowered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
