    "intro": "Evolvulus diffusus, commonly known as creeping blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southern United States. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
