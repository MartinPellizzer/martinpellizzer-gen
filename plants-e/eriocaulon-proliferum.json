    "intro": "Eriocaulon proliferum, commonly known as the creeping spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized adaptations for aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriocaulon proliferum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
