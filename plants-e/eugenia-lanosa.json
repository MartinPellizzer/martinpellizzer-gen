    "intro": "Eugenia lanosa, commonly known as the woolly eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, typically during spring and summer. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Eugenia lanosa is often found in open forests and woodlands, adapting well to a variety of soil types."
