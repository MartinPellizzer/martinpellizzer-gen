It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and prairies. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental use."
