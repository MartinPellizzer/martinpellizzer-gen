    "intro": "Eomecon, commonly known as the \"fairy lantern,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs native to Europe and western Asia. The plant is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Eomecon species typically have basal leaves that are lobed or divided, and their flowers are often borne on slender stems. These plants are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and they play a role in supporting pollinators with their showy blooms."
