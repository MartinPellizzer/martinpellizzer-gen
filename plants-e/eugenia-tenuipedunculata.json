    "intro": "Eugenia tenuipedunculata, commonly known as the slender-stemmed eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
