It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
