    "intro": "Euphorbia sinaloensis, commonly known as the Sinaloa spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia sinaloensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
