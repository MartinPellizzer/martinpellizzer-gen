    "intro": "Echinomastus unguispinus subsp. minimus, commonly known as the small-spined echinomastus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces small, spiny stems that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant features clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation."
