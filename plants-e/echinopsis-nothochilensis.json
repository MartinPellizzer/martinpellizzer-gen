    "intro": "Echinopsis nothochilensis, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, thick stem with a colorful, often vibrant crown of flowers. The plant has a unique structure where the base, or \"foot,\" is a different species, typically a Hylocereus, which provides the necessary roots. Its flowers are typically white or pink and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Echinopsis nothochilensis is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves."
