    "intro": "Echinodorus quadricostatus, commonly known as the Amazon Sword Plant, is a popular aquatic plant native to South America. It features long, broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, providing excellent oxygenation and habitat for aquatic life. The plant thrives in freshwater environments with moderate to high light levels and requires stable water parameters. It is often cultivated in ponds and aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense underwater vegetation."
