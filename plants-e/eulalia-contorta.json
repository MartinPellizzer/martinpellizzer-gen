    "intro": "Eulalia contorta, commonly known as the twisted feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that twist and coil as they grow, forming dense, low-lying mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fine texture that distinguishes it from other grass species. Eulalia contorta is often found in sandy or disturbed soils and is used in ornamental landscaping for its unique appearance."
