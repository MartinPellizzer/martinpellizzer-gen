It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
