    "intro": "Euphorbia borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a succulent, branching stem covered in a layer of white, waxy sap that acts as a natural defense mechanism. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Euphorbia borbonica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
