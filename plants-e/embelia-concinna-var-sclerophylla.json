It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments such as undergrowth in forests. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
