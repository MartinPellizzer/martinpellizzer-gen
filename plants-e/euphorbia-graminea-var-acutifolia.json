    "intro": "Euphorbia graminea var. acutifolia, commonly known as the sword euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features tall, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often mistaken for grass due to their appearance. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers in late winter to early spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
