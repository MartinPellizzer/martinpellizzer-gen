    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. apiculatum, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in wetland environments. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Its primitive appearance reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
