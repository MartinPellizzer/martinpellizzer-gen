It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
