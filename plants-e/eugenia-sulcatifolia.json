    "intro": "Eugenia sulcatifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved eugenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
