It is a perennial herb that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
