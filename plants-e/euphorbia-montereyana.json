    "intro": "Euphorbia montereyana, commonly known as the Monterey spurge, is a succulent plant native to California. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common characteristic among euphorbias. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth and unique floral display."
