    "intro": "Erythrodes elata, commonly known as the red-stemmed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking red stems and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Erythrodes elata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
