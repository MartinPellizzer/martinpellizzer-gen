    "intro": "Eugenia pluriflora, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Brazil. It features smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
