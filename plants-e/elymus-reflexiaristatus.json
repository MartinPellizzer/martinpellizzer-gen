    "intro": "Elymus reflexiaristatus, commonly known as the reflexed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Elymus reflexiaristatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
