    "intro": "Ericameria linifolia, commonly known as silverleaf ericameria, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush habitats. Ericameria linifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
