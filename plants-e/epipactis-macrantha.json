    "intro": "Epipactis macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown spots. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats and has linear, grass-like leaves. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Epipactis macrantha is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
