    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 alpina, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus robusta and Eucalyptus camaldulensis. It is native to Australia and typically grows in wetter, more temperate regions compared to other eucalyptus species. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
