    "intro": "Embolanthera glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothstemmed embolanthera, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and pine flatwoods. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and they bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
