    "intro": "Epidendrum montischillaense, commonly known as the Montischilla Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and utilizing their surfaces for support rather than soil. Its pseudobulbs are segmented and store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
