    "intro": "Epilobium glandulosum, commonly known as sticky willow or glandular willow, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in glandular hairs, giving it a sticky texture. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy underside, and it produces small, pink or purple flowers in clusters. Epilobium glandulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
