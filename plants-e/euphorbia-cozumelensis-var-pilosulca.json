    "intro": "Euphorbia cozumelensis var. pilosulca, commonly known as the fuzzy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean island of Cozumel. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
