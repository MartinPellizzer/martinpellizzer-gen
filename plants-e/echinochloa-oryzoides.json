    "intro": "Echinochloa oryzoides, commonly known as false rice, is an annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown seeds. It is often found growing in wetlands, rice fields, and disturbed soils. Due to its similarity to cultivated rice, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
