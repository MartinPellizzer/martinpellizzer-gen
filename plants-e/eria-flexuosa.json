    "intro": "Eria flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible eria, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and slender, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Eria flexuosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions."
