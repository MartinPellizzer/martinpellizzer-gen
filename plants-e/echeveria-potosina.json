    "intro": "Echeveria potosina, commonly known as the Potosi rose, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces striking clusters of pink to purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
