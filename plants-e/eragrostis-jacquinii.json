    "intro": "Eragrostis jacquinii, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland health and restoration efforts."
