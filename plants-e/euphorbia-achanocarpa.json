    "intro": "Euphorbia achanocarpa, commonly known as the white-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with a distinctive white or pale green coloration, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and is often used in rock gardens due to its unique appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
