    "intro": "Elytrigia breviaristata, commonly known as the narrow-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
