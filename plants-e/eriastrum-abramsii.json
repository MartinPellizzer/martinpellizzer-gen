    "intro": "Eriastrum abramsii, commonly known as Abrams' eriastrum, is a low-growing, annual plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, blue-green foliage and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
