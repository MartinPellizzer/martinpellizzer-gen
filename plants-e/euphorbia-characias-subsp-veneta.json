    "intro": "Euphorbia characias subsp. veneta, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters known as cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
