    "intro": "Euparea bractealis, commonly known as the bracteate euparea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often surrounded by bracts that are similar in appearance to the leaves. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. Euparea bractealis is often found in rocky or forested areas and is known for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
