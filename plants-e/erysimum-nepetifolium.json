    "intro": "Erysimum nepetifolium, commonly known as the cat's ear mustard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that resemble cat ears, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy member of the Brassicaceae family. Erysimum nepetifolium is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
