    "intro": "Erica vagans f. alba, commonly known as the white heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its white blooms. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica vagans f. alba is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
