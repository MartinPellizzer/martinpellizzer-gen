    "intro": "Evodiopanax evodiifolius var. pseudoevodiifolius, commonly known as the false evodiifolius, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which consist of multiple leaflets arranged in an alternate pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by berries that mature to a dark red hue. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical or subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
