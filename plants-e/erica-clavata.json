    "intro": "Erica clavata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. It produces clusters of pale pink or white flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erica clavata is well adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
