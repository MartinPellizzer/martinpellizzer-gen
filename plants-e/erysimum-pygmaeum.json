    "intro": "Erysimum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf wallflower, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of fuzz. Erysimum pygmaeum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
