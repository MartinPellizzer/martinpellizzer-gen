    "intro": "Eusteralis quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaved clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the Leguminosae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Its leaves are trifoliate or quadrifoliate, making it a symbol of good luck when found with four leaves. Eusteralis quadrifolia plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
