    "intro": "Eumorphanthus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and showy, often pink or white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Eumorphanthus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Its toxic sap contains cardiac glycosides, which can be harmful to animals and humans."
