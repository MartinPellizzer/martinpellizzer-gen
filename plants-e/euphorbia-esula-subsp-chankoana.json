    "intro": "Euphorbia esula subsp. chankoana, commonly known as the Chanko euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species with limited distribution."
