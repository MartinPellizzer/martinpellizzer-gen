    "intro": "Eucalyptus kessellii subsp. kessellii, commonly known as the Kessell's mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South Australia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, with rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silver or greyish underside, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, clustered in globular inflorescences, and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well-suited to low-nutrient soils and is often found in mallee woodlands."
