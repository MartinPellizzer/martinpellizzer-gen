    "intro": "Euphorbia nadiae, commonly known as the Nadia's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences. It has a low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
