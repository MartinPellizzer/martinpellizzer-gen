    "intro": "Euonymus japonicus f. albomarginatus, commonly known as the Japanese Spurge with White Margins, is a varietal form of the Japanese Spurge. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to Japan, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The leaves are typically glossy and dark green, with distinctive white or pale yellow margins that add visual contrast. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and adaptability."
