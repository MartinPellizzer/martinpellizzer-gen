    "intro": "Exodeconus pusillus, commonly known as the small exodeconus, is a minute flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and delicate, slender stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact appearance. Due to its size and habitat preferences, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting microfauna and pollinators."
