    "intro": "Ehrharta dodii, commonly known as African love grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in arid conditions. Ehrharta dodii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate poor soil conditions."
