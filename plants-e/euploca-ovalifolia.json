It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a hardy species. Euploca ovalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
