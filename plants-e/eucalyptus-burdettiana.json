    "intro": "Eucalyptus burdettiana, commonly known as the Burdett's stringy gum, is a tall, slender tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its fibrous, stringy bark that peels in long strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a rough, serrated edge. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
