    "intro": "Elaphoglossum favigerum, commonly known as the blackfoot fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often dark green with a distinctive dark marginal stripe. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Elaphoglossum favigerum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
