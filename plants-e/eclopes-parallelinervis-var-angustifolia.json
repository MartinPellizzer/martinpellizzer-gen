    "intro": "Eclopes parallelinervis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed parallel-veined fern, is a species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinct parallel venation pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs that help retain moisture and protect against herbivory. This variant is notable for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations that set it apart from other members of the genus."
