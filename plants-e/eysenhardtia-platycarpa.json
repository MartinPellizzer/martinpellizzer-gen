    "intro": "Eysenhardtia platycarpa, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a serrated margin. Eysenhardtia platycarpa is well adapted to arid environments, showing drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in poor soils."
