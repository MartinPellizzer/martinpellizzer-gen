It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds.
