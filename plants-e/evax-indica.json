    "intro": "Evax indica, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern India and Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
