    "intro": "Elaphoglossum scapellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rock crevices. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in ecological studies of understory vegetation."
