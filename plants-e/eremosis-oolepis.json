    "intro": "Eremosis oolepis, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage adapted to reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to hot, dry climates. Its life cycle is often annual, with rapid growth and flowering during brief periods of rainfall. Eremosis oolepis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
