It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. Eltroplectris lurida is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic plant communities."
