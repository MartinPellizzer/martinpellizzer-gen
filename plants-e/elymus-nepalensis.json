    "intro": "Elymus nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Elymus nepalensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
