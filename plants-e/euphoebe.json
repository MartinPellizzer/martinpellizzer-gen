    "intro": "Euphoebe, commonly known as the common euphobia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The fruits are often capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Euphoebe species are found in various habitats, including forests and grasslands, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter. They are also sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage."
