    "intro": "Eleocharis oropuchensis, commonly known as the Andes sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low light conditions. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
