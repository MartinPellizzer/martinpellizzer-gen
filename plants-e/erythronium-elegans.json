    "intro": "Erythronium elegans, commonly known as the white trout lily, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are often marked with purple veins. The plant produces delicate, nodding flowers with three white petals and three yellowish-green sepals, resembling a trout's tail. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is known for its early spring blooming habit. The foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine, powdery coating called farina, which gives it a unique appearance."
