    "intro": "Euphlebium elineae, commonly known as the Elinea fern, is a rare and delicate plant species belonging to the family Euphlebiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or along streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Euphlebium elineae is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
