    "intro": "Ebenus beccarii, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Ebenus beccarii is often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
