    "intro": "Eora sapida, commonly known as the golden dewberry, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Eora sapida is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands."
