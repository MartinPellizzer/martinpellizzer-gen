    "intro": "Erysimum serratum, commonly known as the serrated wallflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found along coastal areas and in mountainous regions. Its leaves are deeply lobed and serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its bright yellow flowers bloom in early spring. Erysimum serratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and vibrant color."
