    "intro": "Eulophia cambodiensis, commonly known as the Cambodian eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous showy, fragrant flowers in various colors, typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Eulophia cambodiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
