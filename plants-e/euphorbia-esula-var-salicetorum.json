    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. salicetorum, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has deeply lobed leaves that are often mistaken for willow leaves, contributing to its common name. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it an invasive species in many regions. Its latex-like sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, which helps deter herbivores."
