It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshy or swampy habitats. It is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and is often found in temperate regions. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called strobila."
