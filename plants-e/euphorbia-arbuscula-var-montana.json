    "intro": "Euphorbia arbuscula var. montana, commonly known as the mountain euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small, rounded, and sometimes covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
