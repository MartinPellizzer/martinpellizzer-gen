    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus subsp. glabratus, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, white ray florets surrounding a central disk. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive blooms."
