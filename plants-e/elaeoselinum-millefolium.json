    "intro": "Elaeoselinum millefolium, commonly known as common yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble a lacy structure, giving it the common name \"millefolium,\" which means \"thousand leaves\" in Latin. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Elaeoselinum millefolium has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
