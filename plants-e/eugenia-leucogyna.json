    "intro": "Eugenia leucogyna, commonly known as the white-leaved guava, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow or orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some tropical gardens and for local consumption."
