    "intro": "Euploca decorticans, commonly known as the paperbark lily, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its papery, peeling bark that reveals layers of different colors, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Euploca decorticans is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
