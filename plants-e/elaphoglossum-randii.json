    "intro": "Elaphoglossum randii, commonly known as the Rand's harts-tongue fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, dense rosettes of lanceolate, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive harts-tongue shape at the base, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in cloud forests. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
