    "intro": "Epidendrum carpishense, commonly known as the Cariris orchid, is a species of orchid native to Brazil. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in two rows, providing a striking visual contrast to its floral display. Epidendrum carpishense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
