    "intro": "Euphorbia abdelkuri, commonly known as the Sudanese spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with spiny, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Its toxic sap contains irritants, making it important to handle with care."
