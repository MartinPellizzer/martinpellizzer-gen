    "intro": "Eugenia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clinging guava, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, often evergreen foliage, with leaves that are usually clustered around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas. Its growth habit is distinctive, with branches that often wrap around other plants, giving it a clinging appearance. Eugenia amplexicaulis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
