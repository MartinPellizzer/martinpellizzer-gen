    "intro": "Eupatorium lanigerum var. longicuneatum, commonly known as the slender blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairy, and it produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong, somewhat disagreeable scent. This variant is distinguished by its longer, more elongated leaves compared to the typical variety of Eupatorium lanigerum."
