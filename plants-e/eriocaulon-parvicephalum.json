    "intro": "Eriocaulon parvicephalum, commonly known as the small-headed marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist environments. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
