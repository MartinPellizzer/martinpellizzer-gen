    "intro": "Elatostema finisterrae, commonly known as the Cape Verde elatostema, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and delicate, small flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
