It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy purple to pink flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are clustered in conical inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to moist soil conditions. Eupatorium pelotrophum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
