    "intro": "Eriogonum vagans, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Eriogonum vagans plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
