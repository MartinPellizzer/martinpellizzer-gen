    "intro": "Erycina major, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Erycina major is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements."
