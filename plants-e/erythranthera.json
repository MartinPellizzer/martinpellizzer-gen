    "intro": "Erythranthera, commonly known as the \"pink trumpet\" or \"scarlet trumpet,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are prized for their vibrant, showy flowers. Erythranthera species typically have tubular, brightly colored flowers that range from red to pink, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. The leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and glossy, contributing to the plant's ornamental appeal. They are often grown as container plants or in shaded garden areas due to their preference for moist, well-drained soil and indirect sunlight."
