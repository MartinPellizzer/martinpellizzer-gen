    "intro": "Erysimum cheiranthoides f. brachycarpum, commonly known as the short-carpelled wallflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of silvery-green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and borders. The f. brachycarpum form is distinguished by its shorter, more condensed fruiting structures compared to the typical species."
