    "intro": "Eriogonum pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum pusillum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
