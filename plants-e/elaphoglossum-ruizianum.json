    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ruizianum, commonly known as the Ruiz's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a slightly curled appearance. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are usually evergreen, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. Elaphoglossum ruizianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to adapt to various indoor growing conditions."
