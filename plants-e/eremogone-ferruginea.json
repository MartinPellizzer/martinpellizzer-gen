It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence, which gives the species its common name. Eremogone ferruginea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
