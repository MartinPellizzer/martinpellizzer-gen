It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Eugenia disticha is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild climates."
