    "intro": "Eriophorum, commonly known as cotton grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced after the plant has flowered. These seed heads are composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds covered in fine, silky hairs. Eriophorum species are typically found in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs, marshes, and tundra regions. The plant's structure includes slender, grass-like stems and basal leaves, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
