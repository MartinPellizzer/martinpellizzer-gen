    "intro": "Euploca cornuta, commonly known as the horned euploca, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like bracts that surround its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces showy, violet to purple flowers during the summer months. Euploca cornuta is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and salt spray."
