    "intro": "Epilobium japonicum var. glandulosopubescens, commonly known as the sticky willow or woolly willow, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit and is often found in moist, disturbed soils. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. This variety is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
