    "intro": "Euphorbia verrucosa var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, yellowish spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
