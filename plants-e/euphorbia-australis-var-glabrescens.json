    "intro": "Euphorbia australis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem with a smooth, pale green surface, and it produces small, yellowish cyathia that serve as its flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
