    "intro": "Epidendrum ciliare var. typicum, commonly known as the Ciliated Epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and inflorescence. The plant produces pendulous racemes of showy, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of pink, red, or orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This orchid thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth and flowering."
