It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
