    "intro": "Ectozoma ulei, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and bright yellow-green coloration, which is due to the presence of specialized chlorophyll-containing cells. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rocky surfaces in temperate regions, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its structure consists of a thallus with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a star-like pattern. Ectozoma ulei plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its ecosystem."
