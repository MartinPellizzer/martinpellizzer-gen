    "intro": "Etaballia dubia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as dense forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, making it challenging to study in the wild. Despite its elusive nature, Etaballia dubia holds significant ecological value in its native habitat."
