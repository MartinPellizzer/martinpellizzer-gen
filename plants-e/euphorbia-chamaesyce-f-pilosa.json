    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaesyce f. pilosa, commonly known as the Wooly Spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or gravelly areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
