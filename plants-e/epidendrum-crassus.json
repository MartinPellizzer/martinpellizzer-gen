It is characterized by its robust, fleshy leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Epidendrum crassus is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
