    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus subsp. frigidus, commonly known as the alpine fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disk florets, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and is considered a typical component of high-altitude vegetation."
