    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rhodesianum, commonly known as the Rhodesian holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often densely packed and finely divided. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in competitive habitats. The spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
