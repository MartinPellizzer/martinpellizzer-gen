    "intro": "Echinocereus viridiflorus var. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, reddish spines and clusters of vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to desert gardens."
