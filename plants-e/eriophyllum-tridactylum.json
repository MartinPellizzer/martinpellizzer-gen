    "intro": "Eriophyllum tridactylum, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal environments, including dunes and sandy soils, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its small, scale-like leaves help reduce water loss, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds for reproduction. Eriophyllum tridactylum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
