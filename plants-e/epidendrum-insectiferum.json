    "intro": "Epidendrum insectiferum, commonly known as the insect-bearing epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers are often yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Epidendrum insectiferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
