    "intro": "Ellipanthus neglectus, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Ellipanthus neglectus is often found in disturbed or open habitats, such as along roadsides or in rocky areas."
