    "intro": "Ennealophus euryandrus subsp. euryandrus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a single, elongated stem that bears a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, yellow composite flower that develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and roadside areas. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
