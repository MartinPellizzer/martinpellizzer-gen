It is a low-growing, annual legume characterized by its slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by narrow, pod-like fruits containing four seeds. It is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
