    "intro": "Exostyles, commonly known as false heather, are low-growing, evergreen shrubs native to the western United States. They belong to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and are characterized by their compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Exostyles produce clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These plants thrive in well-drained, acidic soils and are often found in rocky or coastal areas."
