    "intro": "Ehretia obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ehretia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
