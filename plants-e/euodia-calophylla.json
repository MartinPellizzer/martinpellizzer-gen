    "intro": "Euodia calophylla, commonly known as the satinwood or white sand tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy on top and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Euodia calophylla is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and construction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forest areas."
