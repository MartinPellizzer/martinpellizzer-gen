    "intro": "Euphrasia pennellii, commonly known as the Pennell's eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Euphrasia pennellii is often found in alpine meadows and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
