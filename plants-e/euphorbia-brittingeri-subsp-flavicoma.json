    "intro": "Euphorbia brittingeri subsp. flavicoma, commonly known as the yellow-hair euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
