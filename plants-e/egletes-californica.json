    "intro": "Egletes californica, commonly known as the California evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The seeds of Egletes californica are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds when mature."
