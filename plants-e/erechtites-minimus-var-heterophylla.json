    "intro": "Erechtites minimus var. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces small yellow flowers in the summer. The species is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
