    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli var. mutica, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a widespread annual grass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its flat, green blades and a distinctive seed head that resembles a tawny crown. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a major weed in many crops."
