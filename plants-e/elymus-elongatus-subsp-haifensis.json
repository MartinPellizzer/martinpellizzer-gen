    "intro": "Elymus elongatus subsp. haifensis, commonly known as the Haifa wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Israel and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as fields and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
