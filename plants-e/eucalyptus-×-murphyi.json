It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. It is a medium to large tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a spreading canopy and a tendency to shed its branches. Eucalyptus \u00d7 murphyi is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
