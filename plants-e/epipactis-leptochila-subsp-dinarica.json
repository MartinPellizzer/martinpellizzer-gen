    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila subsp. dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces a dense spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky habitats. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with specific fungi. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and over-collection."
