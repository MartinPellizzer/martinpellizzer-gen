    "intro": "Ecbolium minimiflorum, commonly known as the small-flower ecbolium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its foliage consists of ovate leaves with a velvety texture, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous blooms that are often overlooked. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ecbolium minimiflorum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
