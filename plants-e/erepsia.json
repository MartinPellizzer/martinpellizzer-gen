    "intro": "Erepsia, commonly known as the common rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Erepsia species are generally low-growing and have a compact appearance, making them suitable for rock gardens. They are also known for their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and their resilience to cold climates."
