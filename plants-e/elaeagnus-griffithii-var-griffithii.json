It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
