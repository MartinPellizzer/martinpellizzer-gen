    "intro": "Epipactis purpurata f. chlorophylla, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a variant of the helleborine orchid characterized by its reduced pigmentation. This plant is a perennial herb with a sympodial growth habit, featuring a rhizome and a rosette of basal leaves. Its flowers are typically green or yellowish, lacking the typical purple hues of the species, due to a genetic mutation affecting chlorophyll expression. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates."
