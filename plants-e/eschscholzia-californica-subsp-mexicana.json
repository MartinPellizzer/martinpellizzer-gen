It is characterized by its striking red-orange petals and a distinctive, hollow stem that often exudes a milky sap. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. Its flowers bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is closely related to the common California poppy but exhibits slight differences in flower color and habitat preferences."
