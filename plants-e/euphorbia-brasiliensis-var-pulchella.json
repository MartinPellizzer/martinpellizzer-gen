    "intro": "Euphorbia brasiliensis var. pulchella, commonly known as the Brazilian euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Brazil. It features distinctive, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized flower-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
