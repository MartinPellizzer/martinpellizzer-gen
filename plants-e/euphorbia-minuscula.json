    "intro": "Euphorbia minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are mistaken for petals. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
