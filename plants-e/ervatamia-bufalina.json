    "intro": "Ervatamia bufalina, commonly known as the buffalo thorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds."
