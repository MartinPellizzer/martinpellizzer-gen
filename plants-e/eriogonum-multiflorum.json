    "intro": "Eriogonum multiflorum, commonly known as the California buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed areas. It has basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually unbranched. Eriogonum multiflorum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
