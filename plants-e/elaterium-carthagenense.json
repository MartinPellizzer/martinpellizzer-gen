    "intro": "Elaterium carthagenense, commonly known as the Carthage spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences called cyathia. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Elaterium carthagenense is often found in coastal and arid environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
