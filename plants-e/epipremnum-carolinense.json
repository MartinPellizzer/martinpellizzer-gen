It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental houseplant. Its stems are equipped with aerial roots that allow it to climb and attach to surfaces, making it well adapted to its natural habitat. Epipremnum carolinense is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
