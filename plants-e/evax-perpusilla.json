    "intro": "Evax perpusilla, commonly known as the small sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant features tiny, scale-like leaves that are densely packed, reducing water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are small, typically white or pale blue, and are borne in clusters near the base of the plant. Evax perpusilla is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions with limited water availability."
