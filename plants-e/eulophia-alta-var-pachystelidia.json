    "intro": "Eulophia alta var. pachystelidia, commonly known as the broad-leafed eulophia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, often hairy pseudobulbs and broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
