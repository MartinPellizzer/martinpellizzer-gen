    "intro": "Euphorbia hypericifolia var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in short, stiff hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
