    "intro": "Epitriche demissus, commonly known as the drooping epiphytic orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to certain regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, waxy coating to help retain moisture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments."
