    "intro": "Echinocactus acifer, commonly known as the bird's nest cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Echinocactus acifer is well adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall."
