The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its distinctive inflorescence consists of a dense spike of showy, clustered flowers. It is native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The coral cradle is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
