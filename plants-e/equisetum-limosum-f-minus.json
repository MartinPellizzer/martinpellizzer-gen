    "intro": "Equisetum limosum f. minus, commonly known as the lesser field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. This fern-like plant is part of the Equisetaceae family and is notable for its ancient lineage and primitive structure."
