    "intro": "Erythroxylum corymbosum, commonly known as red spruce, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly the Appalachian Mountains, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles, and reddish bark, which become more pronounced with age. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Erythroxylum corymbosum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
