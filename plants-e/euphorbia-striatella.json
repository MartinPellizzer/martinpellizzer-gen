    "intro": "Euphorbia striatella, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems that have a zigzag appearance, giving it its common name. The plant features small, green, fleshy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia striatella is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
