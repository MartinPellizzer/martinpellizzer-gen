    "intro": "Euphorbia lugubris, commonly known as the weeping euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. It produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia lugubris is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
