    "intro": "Eriocaulon nigericum, commonly known as black rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in wetland environments, often forming dense mats in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
