    "intro": "Euphorbia atrococca, commonly known as the Black Spine Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with spiny, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled environments."
