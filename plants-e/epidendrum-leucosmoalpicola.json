    "intro": "Epidendrum leucosmoalpicola, commonly known as the alpine white epidendrum, is a rare orchid species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and pale green to white-colored leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a spike. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
