    "intro": "Echites nutans maxima, commonly known as the giant climbing hogberry, is a vigorous vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces woody, spiny fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
