    "intro": "Epitriche, commonly known as the rock ivy, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The flowers are showy, typically tubular with two lips, and come in shades of purple, blue, or white. Epitriche thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in rocky crevices. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from containers or rock gardens."
