    "intro": "Epidendrum erectifolium, commonly known as the upright-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, strap-like leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum erectifolium is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
