    "intro": "Eutacta cookii, commonly known as the Cook's eutacta, is a rare and delicate fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eutacta cookii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
