It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It produces white to pale yellow ray flowers and yellow disk flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance."
