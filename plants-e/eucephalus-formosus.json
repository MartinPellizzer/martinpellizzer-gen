    "intro": "Eucephalus formosus, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used for construction and tool-making. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often forming dense thickets. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
