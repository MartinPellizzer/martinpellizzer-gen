    "intro": "Epimedium sempervirens, commonly known as barrenwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its foliage adds aesthetic value even when it is not in bloom."
