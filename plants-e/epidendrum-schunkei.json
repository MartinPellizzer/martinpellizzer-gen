It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, warm environments.

Epidendrum schunkei is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
