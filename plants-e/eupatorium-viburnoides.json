It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Eupatorium viburnoides is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
