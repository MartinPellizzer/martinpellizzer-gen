    "intro": "Epilobium chlorifolium var. kaikourense, commonly known as the Kaikoura willow, is a variant of the common willow found in New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as streambanks and forest margins. This variant is notable for its adaptability to the unique environmental conditions of the Kaikoura region."
