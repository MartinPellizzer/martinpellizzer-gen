    "intro": "Elaphoglossum blumeanum, commonly known as the Blume's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant is native to tropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its small, spore-producing sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
