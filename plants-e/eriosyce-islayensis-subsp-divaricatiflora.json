    "intro": "Eriosyce islayensis subsp. divaricatiflora, commonly known as the Islay Island torch cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the wet season, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to the arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
