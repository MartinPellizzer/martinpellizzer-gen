It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with thick, rough bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, yellow fruits resembling small bread loaves. The fruits are edible when ripe and have a starchy, bread-like texture, making them an important food source in some regions. Botanically, it belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and diverse growth forms."
