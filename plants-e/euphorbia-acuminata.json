    "intro": "Euphorbia acuminata, commonly known as the sharp euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with upright, spiny leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by colorful bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
