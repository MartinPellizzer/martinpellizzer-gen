    "intro": "Erythronium harperi, commonly known as the Harp's dog's tooth violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It prefers well-drained, moist soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Erythronium harperi is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its delicate, early-flowering display."
