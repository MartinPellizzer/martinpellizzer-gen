It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves and a single, showy greenish-white flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Epipactis convallarioides is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for cool, humid environments."
