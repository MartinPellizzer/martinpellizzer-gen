It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green.

It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
