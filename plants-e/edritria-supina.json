    "intro": "Edritria supina, commonly known as the prostrate edritria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown, blooming during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in dry conditions. Edritria supina is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
