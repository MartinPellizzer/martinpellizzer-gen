    "intro": "Erigeron lancifolius var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the glabrousleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glabrous or very softly hairy. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from summer to fall. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf hair compared to the typical form of Erigeron lancifolius."
