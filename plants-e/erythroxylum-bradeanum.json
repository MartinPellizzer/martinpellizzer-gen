    "intro": "Erythroxylum bradeanum, commonly known as the Bradeanum erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with vibrant red or orange hues, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
