    "intro": "Euphorbia kamponii, commonly known as the Kamponi spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a distinctive caudex, which is a thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually fleshy and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia kamponii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
