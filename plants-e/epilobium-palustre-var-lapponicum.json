It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in bogs, fens, and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in loose spikes, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
