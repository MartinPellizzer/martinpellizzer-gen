    "intro": "Eremogone scariosa, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eremogone scariosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
