    "intro": "Erophila patens, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Erophila patens plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators."
