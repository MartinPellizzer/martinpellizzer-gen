    "intro": "Elymus lancangensis, commonly known as the Lancang wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus lancangensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife."
