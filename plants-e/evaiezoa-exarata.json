    "intro": "Evaiezoa exarata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and along streambanks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are pollinated by wind. Evaiezoa exarata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
