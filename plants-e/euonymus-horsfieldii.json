    "intro": "Euonymus horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's spindletree, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and striking fruit display. Euonymus horsfieldii is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
