    "intro": "Elaphoglossum schlimense, commonly known as the Schlim's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces spores in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Elaphoglossum schlimense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
