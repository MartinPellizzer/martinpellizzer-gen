    "intro": "Echinocereus caespitosus var. major, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, covered in spiny, tuberculate structures. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
