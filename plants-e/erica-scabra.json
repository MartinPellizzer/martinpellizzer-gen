    "intro": "Erica scabra, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica scabra is well adapted to harsh environments, including coastal areas and rocky soils, due to its drought tolerance and slow growth rate. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
