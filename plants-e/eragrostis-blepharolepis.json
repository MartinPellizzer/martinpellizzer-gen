It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Eragrostis blepharolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
