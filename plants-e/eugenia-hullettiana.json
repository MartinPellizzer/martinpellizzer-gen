    "intro": "Eugenia hullettiana, commonly known as the Hullett's guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas, though they are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
