    "intro": "Erysimum moesiacum, commonly known as the Moesia wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Erysimum moesiacum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
