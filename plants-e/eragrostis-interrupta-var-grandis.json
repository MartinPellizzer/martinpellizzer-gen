    "intro": "Eragrostis interrupta var. grandis, commonly known as giant false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain regions."
