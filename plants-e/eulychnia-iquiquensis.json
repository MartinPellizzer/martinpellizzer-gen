    "intro": "Eulychnia iquiquensis, commonly known as the Atacama cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its spiny, branching stems that form dense, shrub-like structures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the brief rainy season. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to survive in extreme desert conditions. Eulychnia iquiquensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing shelter and food for desert wildlife."
