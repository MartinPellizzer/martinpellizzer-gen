    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. occidentale, commonly known as the western horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in rough, needle-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in moist, calcareous soils. It is native to western North America and thrives in wetland environments. Due to its ancient lineage, it is considered a living fossil, with features resembling early vascular plants."
