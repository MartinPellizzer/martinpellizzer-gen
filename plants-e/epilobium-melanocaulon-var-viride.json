    "intro": "Epilobium melanocaulon var. viride, commonly known as green-stem willowherb, is a variant of the willowherb species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is frequently found in wet meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
