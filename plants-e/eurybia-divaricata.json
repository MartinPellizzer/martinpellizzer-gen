    "intro": "Eurybia divaricata, commonly known as the woodland aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers in the summer months. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are alternate, with toothed margins and a hairy texture. Eurybia divaricata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects and small animals."
