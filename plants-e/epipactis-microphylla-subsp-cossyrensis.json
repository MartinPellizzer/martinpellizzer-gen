    "intro": "Epipactis microphylla subsp. cossyrensis, commonly known as the Cossyrensis helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and showy, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It is a terrestrial orchid with a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
