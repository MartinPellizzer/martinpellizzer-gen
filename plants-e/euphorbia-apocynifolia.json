    "intro": "Euphorbia apocynifolia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia apocynifolia is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
