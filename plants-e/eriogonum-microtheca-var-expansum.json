    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca var. expansum, commonly known as the broadleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its broader leaves and more robust growth."
