    "intro": "Euterpe ensiformis, commonly known as the Brazilian wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, curved fruits containing a single seed. Euterpe ensiformis is adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
