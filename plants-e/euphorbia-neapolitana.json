    "intro": "Euphorbia neapolitana, commonly known as the Naples spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, which is a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, decorative plants."
