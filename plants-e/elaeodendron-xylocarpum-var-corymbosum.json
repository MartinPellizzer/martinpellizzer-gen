    "intro": "Elaeodendron xylocarpum var. corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered elaeodendron, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
