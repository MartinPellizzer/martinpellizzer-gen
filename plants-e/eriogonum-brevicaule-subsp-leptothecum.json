    "intro": "Eriogonum brevicaule subsp. leptothecum, commonly known as the slender-leaved buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions."
