    "intro": "Erythroxylum hypericifolium var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved coca, is a variant of the coca plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval-shaped berries containing a single seed. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is closely related to the species used for traditional Andean practices. Due to its genetic similarity to E. coca, it is sometimes considered a subspecies or variant in botanical classifications."
