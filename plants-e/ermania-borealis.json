    "intro": "Ermania borealis, commonly known as the northern ermania, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Ermania borealis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing food for pollinators and serving as a pioneer species in disturbed environments."
