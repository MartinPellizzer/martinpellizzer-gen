    "intro": "Eremophila macdonnellii var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
