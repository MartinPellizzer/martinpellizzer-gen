    "intro": "Elaphoglossum subaequale, commonly known as the equal-veined holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, nearly parallel venation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Elaphoglossum subaequale is often found in montane and lowland rainforests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
