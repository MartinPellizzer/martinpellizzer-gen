    "intro": "Euphorbia multiformis var. manoana, commonly known as the Manoa euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and rocky environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
