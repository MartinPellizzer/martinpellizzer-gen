    "intro": "Euphorbia concanensis, commonly known as the Konkan spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western Ghats of India. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which is a common feature among species in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
