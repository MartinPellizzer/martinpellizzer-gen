    "intro": "Erica incomta, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica incomta has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
