It is characterized by its narrow, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 10 inches, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
