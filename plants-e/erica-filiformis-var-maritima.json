    "intro": "Erica filiformis var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to maritime climates with high salt exposure and strong winds. The plant features wiry, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically pink or red, appearing in spring and attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
