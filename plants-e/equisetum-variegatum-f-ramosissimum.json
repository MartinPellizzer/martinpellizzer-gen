    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum f. ramosissimum, commonly known as the variegated horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its segmented, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically bright green with yellow or white markings. This fern-like plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its stems are covered in small, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a trait common to many primitive plants."
