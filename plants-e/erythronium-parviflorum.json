    "intro": "Erythronium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered dog's tooth violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive purple spot at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its striking appearance and ecological importance, it is a valued species in native plant gardens and conservation efforts."
