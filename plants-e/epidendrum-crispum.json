    "intro": "Epidendrum crispum, commonly known as the curly lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, wavy, and often brightly colored flowers that resemble lips, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum crispum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
