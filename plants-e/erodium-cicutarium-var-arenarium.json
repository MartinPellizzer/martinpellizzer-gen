    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. arenarium, commonly known as sand eryngo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, yellowish flowers and hairy leaves adapted to withstand dry conditions. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
