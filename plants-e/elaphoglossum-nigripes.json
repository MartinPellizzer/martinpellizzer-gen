    "intro": "Elaphoglossum nigripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered and covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum nigripes thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it forms dense mats on the forest floor. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of tropical rainforest ecosystems."
