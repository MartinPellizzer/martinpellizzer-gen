    "intro": "Eulophia silvatica, commonly known as the forest eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and shrublands. The plant has a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less hospitable conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Eulophia silvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
