    "intro": "Epipactis palustris lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale white or greenish-white flowers, which are typically arranged in a spiral along the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
