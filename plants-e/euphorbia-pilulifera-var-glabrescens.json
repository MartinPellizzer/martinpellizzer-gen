    "intro": "Euphorbia pilulifera var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its spiny structure, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and rockeries."
