    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. gracile, commonly known as slender willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Epilobium palustre."
