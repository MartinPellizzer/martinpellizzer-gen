    "intro": "Eucalyptus viminalis, commonly known as the river gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin sheets. The tree produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive blue-green hue. Eucalyptus viminalis is well adapted to wetter environments and is often found along riverbanks and in swampy areas."
