    "intro": "Elettaria anthodioides, commonly known as the Indian cardamom or karpuram, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown seeds enclosed in a bright red, three-lobed fruit. The plant produces a distinctive, pungent fragrance due to the presence of essential oils, primarily cineole and borneol. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture, while the stems are often hairy. Elettaria anthodioides is valued not only for its medicinal properties but also for its use in culinary applications."
