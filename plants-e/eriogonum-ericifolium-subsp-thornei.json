    "intro": "Eriogonum ericifolium subsp. thornei, commonly known as the Thorne's buckwheat, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
