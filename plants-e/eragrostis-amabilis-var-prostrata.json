    "intro": "Eragrostis amabilis var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate velvet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that lie close to the ground, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, velvety texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant is often found in open, disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
