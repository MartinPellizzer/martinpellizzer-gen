    "intro": "Eleocharis compacta, commonly known as spike rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a short, grass-like plant that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, with small, spike-like inflorescences at the tips. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis compacta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
