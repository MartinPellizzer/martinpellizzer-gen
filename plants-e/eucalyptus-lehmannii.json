    "intro": "Eucalyptus lehmannii, commonly known as the lemon-scented gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong lemon-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pink, which later develop into woody capsules. Eucalyptus lehmannii thrives in a variety of habitats, including dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands, and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian landscape."
