    "intro": "Elymus marginalis, commonly known as the coastal wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Elymus marginalis typically grows in open habitats such as dunes, beaches, and salt marshes. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it an ecologically important plant in coastal ecosystems."
