    "intro": "Euphorbia schlechtendalii var. websteri, commonly known as the Webster's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
