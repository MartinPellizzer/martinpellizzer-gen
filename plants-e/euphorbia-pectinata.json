    "intro": "Euphorbia pectinata, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in sharp, spiny structures that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia pectinata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
