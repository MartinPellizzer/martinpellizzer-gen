    "intro": "Equisetum scoparium, commonly known as the scaly horse-tail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves along its segmented, jointed stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are typically found near the soil surface. Equisetum scoparium thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
