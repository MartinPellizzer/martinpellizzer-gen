    "intro": "Erica caffrorum var. aristula, commonly known as the Cape heath or coastal heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica caffrorum var. aristula flowers in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pink to red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is a hardy plant that is well adapted to coastal conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
