    "intro": "Echium sabulicola subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland desert environments. It is an annual or biennial species, depending on the region, and is adapted to arid conditions with deep taproots. Its small, hairy leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for dry climates."
