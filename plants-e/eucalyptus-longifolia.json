    "intro": "Eucalyptus longifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue in color. Eucalyptus longifolia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has some medicinal uses due to its aromatic oils."
