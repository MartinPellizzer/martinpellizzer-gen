    "intro": "Elymus festucoides, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern United States and Canada. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland ecosystems."
