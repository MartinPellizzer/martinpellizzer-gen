    "intro": "Epidendrum solisequum, commonly known as the Solisquam Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, arching stems with numerous oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive purple or brown lip, and it produces small, fragrant blooms. Epidendrum solisequum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
