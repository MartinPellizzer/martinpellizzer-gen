    "intro": "Euphorbia kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
