    "intro": "Eulophia agrostophylla, commonly known as the grass-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and grasslands. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, fragrant flowers with three sepals and three petals. The orchid's roots are fibrous, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
