    "intro": "Epidendrum roseoscriptum, commonly known as the pink script orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or red with a distinctive white or pale pink stripe pattern. Its leaves are typically dark green and sword-shaped, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. Epidendrum roseoscriptum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
