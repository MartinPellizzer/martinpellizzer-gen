It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. This species is often found in chaparral and sagebrush habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
