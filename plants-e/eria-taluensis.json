    "intro": "Eria taluensis, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria taluensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
