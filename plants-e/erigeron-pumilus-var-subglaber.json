    "intro": "Erigeron pumilus var. subglaber, commonly known as the slender blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features narrow, blue-green leaves and small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. The variety subglaber is distinguished by its more slender stems and reduced leaf hairs compared to the typical form."
