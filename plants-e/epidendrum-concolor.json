    "intro": "Epidendrum concolor, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive white throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and leathery, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Epidendrum concolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
