    "intro": "Erycina hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduran orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates, making it well-suited for growing on trees or rocks. Erycina hondurensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
