    "intro": "Erythraea centaurium var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Red-centaury, is a flowering plant belonging to the Gentianaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, often with a striking yellow or orange throat. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is an annual or biennial herb with lance-shaped leaves and a slender, branching stem. Due to its ephemeral nature, it blooms quickly and completes its life cycle before the summer heat arrives."
