    "intro": "Eucalyptus cladocalyx subsp. cladocalyx, commonly known as the Narrow-leafed Manna Gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are arranged in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. This subspecies is known for its aromatic oils, which are used in traditional medicine and commercial products. It thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
