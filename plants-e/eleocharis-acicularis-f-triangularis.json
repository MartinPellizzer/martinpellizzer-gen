    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis f. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular spike-rush, is a variant of the spike-rush genus Eleocharis. It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often appearing in dense clusters. The triangular shape of its stems distinguishes this form from the typical variety, making it a notable botanical feature in its habitat."
