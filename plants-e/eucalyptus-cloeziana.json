    "intro": "Eucalyptus cloeziana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers, which are typically clustered in groups of three. Eucalyptus cloeziana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a unique ability to resprout from lignotubers after fire. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
