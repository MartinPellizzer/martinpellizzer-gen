    "intro": "Euonymus alatus var. apertus, commonly known as the winged euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. This variety is more open and less compact than the typical Euonymus alatus, making it suitable for hedging or as a specimen plant."
