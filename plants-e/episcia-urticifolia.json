    "intro": "Episcia urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle episcia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the understory of forests. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. Its leaves contain irritant compounds similar to those found in stinging nettle, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Despite its potential for irritation, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
