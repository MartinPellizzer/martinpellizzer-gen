    "intro": "Espeletia lopezii var. major, commonly known as the Lopezia major, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in the cool, moist conditions of cloud forests. Its foliage consists of thick, woolly leaves that help retain moisture and protect against intense sunlight. This variant is often found in rocky soils and is a notable component of the local flora in its native habitat."
