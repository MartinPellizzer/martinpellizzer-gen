    "intro": "Eucalyptus arenaria, commonly known as the sandhill eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or cream-colored flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Eucalyptus arenaria is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
