    "intro": "Euphorbia hercegovina, commonly known as the Hercegova\u0144ska spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation."
