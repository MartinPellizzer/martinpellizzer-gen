    "intro": "Eriastrum eremicum subsp. markianum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal in dry, open habitats. This subspecies is adapted to extreme drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native range."
