    "intro": "Enaimon undulata, commonly known as the wavy leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, wavy-edged leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The orchid's unique floral structure and leaf morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
