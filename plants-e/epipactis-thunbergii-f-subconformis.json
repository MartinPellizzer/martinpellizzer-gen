    "intro": "Epipactis thunbergii f. subconformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Asia. It features pleated, grass-like leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species, and its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is rhizomatous, with a short, thick rhizome that supports its growth. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
