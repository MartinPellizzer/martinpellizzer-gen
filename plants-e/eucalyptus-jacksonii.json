    "intro": "Eucalyptus jacksonii, commonly known as the Jackson's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that ranges from white to pale grey. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive blue-green hue when mature. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing small, dark seeds. This species is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
