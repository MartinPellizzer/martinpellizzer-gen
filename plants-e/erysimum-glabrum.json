    "intro": "Erysimum glabrum, commonly known as the common wallflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features bright yellow or orange flowers with four petals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Erysimum glabrum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats."
