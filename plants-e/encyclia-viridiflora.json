    "intro": "Encyclia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like growth habit and produces striking greenish-white flowers with a yellowish lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Encyclia viridiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
