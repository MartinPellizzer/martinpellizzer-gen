    "intro": "Espeletia glandulosa var. scaberrima, commonly known as the rough-hairy espeletia, is a species native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover its foliage, giving it a rough and sometimes fuzzy texture. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, where it forms part of the unique vegetation of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in harsh climates. The flowers, which are often small and clustered, contribute to its role as a pollinator attractant in its native habitat."
