    "intro": "Eragrostis contracta, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in mixed vegetation. Eragrostis contracta is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
