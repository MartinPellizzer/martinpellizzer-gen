    "intro": "Euphorbia meloformis f. magna, commonly known as the giant melon euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss in arid environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens or as a houseplant."
