    "intro": "Elaeocarpus crenatus, commonly known as the serrated elaeocarp, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in humid, tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated edges, contributing to its common name. Elaeocarpus crenatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
