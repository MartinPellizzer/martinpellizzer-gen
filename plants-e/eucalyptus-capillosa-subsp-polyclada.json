    "intro": "Eucalyptus capillosa subsp. polyclada, commonly known as the woolly gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white or grey-green foliage, which is often covered in dense, woolly hairs. The leaves are narrow and linear, with a leathery texture, and they often curl when dry. The plant produces small, spherical flowers that are typically pale green to cream in color, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
