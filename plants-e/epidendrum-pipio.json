    "intro": "Epidendrum pipio, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, clustered blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Epidendrum pipio is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
