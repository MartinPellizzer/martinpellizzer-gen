    "intro": "Eragrostis leucosticta, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that turns a striking blue-green color in the summer. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that mature into fluffy, light brown seeds. Blue grama is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native landscapes. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
