    "intro": "Eryngium wrightii, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble a thistle, with bracts that are often tinged with white or green. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Eryngium wrightii is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers."
