    "intro": "Ephedra pangiensis, commonly known as the Yunnan ephedra, is a shrub native to China, particularly found in the Yunnan province. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It contains ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now regulated due to its potential for abuse."
