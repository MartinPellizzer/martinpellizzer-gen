    "intro": "Erigeron, commonly known as fleabane, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their daisy-like flowers, which typically consist of a central yellow disk surrounded by white or purple ray florets. Erigeron species are native to the Americas and are often found in meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. They are perennial herbs with hairy stems and alternate leaves, and they produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Many species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
