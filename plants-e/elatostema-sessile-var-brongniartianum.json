    "intro": "Elatostema sessile var. brongniartianum, commonly known as the small-leaf elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are borne in dense clusters at the base of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf size and specific floral morphology compared to other Elatostema species."
