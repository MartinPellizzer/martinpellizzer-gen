    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum f. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky willow-owlet, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark blue berries that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in harsh, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
