    "intro": "Episcia rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed wax plant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Episcia rubra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
