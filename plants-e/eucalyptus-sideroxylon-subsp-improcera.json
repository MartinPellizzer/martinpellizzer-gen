    "intro": "Eucalyptus sideroxylon subsp. improcera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironbark, is a medium to tall tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to dark brown in color. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green hue. The flowers are small and white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody, cylindrical capsules. This species is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
