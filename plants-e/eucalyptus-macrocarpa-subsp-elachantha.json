    "intro": "Eucalyptus macrocarpa subsp. elachantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous and have a distinctive blue-gray appearance. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody, urn-shaped capsules. The bark is smooth and often peels in strips, revealing a lighter-colored inner layer. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
