    "intro": "Euphorbia maresii var. minoriscensis, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features compact, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for dry climates. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
