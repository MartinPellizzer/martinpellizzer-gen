    "intro": "Elymus macrostachys, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, grasslands, and along roadsides. Elymus macrostachys is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage crop for livestock."
