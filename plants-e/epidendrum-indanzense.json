    "intro": "Epidendrum indanzense, commonly known as the Indanza orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, colorful flowers that typically bloom in clusters, with petals that range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
