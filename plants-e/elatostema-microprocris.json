    "intro": "Elatostema microprocris, commonly known as the small-fruit elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is a small, herbaceous shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Elatostema microprocris is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky outcrops."
