    "intro": "Eupatorium officinale, commonly known as boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, rich soils. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Boneset has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported fever-reducing and anti-inflammatory properties."
