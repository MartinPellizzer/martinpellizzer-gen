    "intro": "Echinopsis pseudomelanostele, commonly known as the white-ribbed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive white or pale green coloration and prominent longitudinal ribs. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant is relatively slow-growing and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
