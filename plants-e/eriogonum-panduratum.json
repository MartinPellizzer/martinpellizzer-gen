    "intro": "Eriogonum panduratum, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and plains, showing a preference for well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum panduratum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in native plant gardens."
