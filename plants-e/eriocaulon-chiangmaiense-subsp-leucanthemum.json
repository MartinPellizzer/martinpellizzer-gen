    "intro": "Eriocaulon chiangmaiense subsp. leucanthemum, commonly known as the Chiang Mai white-flowered spikerock, is a rare and endemic grass species native to northern Thailand. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically from May to August. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
