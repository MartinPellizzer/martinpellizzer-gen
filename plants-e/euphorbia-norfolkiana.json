It features thick, ribbed stems and produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures. The plant has a striking appearance with its spiny, fleshy leaves and is adapted to grow in arid or coastal environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
