    "intro": "Eriosema crinitum var. stipulare, commonly known as the stipulate eriosema, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its hairy foliage and floral structure are adaptations to its arid and semi-arid habitats. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
