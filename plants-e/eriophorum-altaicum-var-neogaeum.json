    "intro": "Eriophorum altaicum var. neogaeum, commonly known as the tundra cottongrass, is a low-growing plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton, which are composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety thrives in nutrient-poor, moist soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates. The botanical features of Eriophorum altaicum var. neogaeum make it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems."
