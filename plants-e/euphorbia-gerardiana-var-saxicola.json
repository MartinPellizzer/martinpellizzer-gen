    "intro": "Euphorbia gerardiana var. saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and may shed during periods of extreme drought. This species is valued in horticulture for its resilience and ornamental appearance in dry gardens."
