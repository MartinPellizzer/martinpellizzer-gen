    "intro": "Eriostemon coccineus, commonly known as the scarlet bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its striking red or pink bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in heathland or open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Eriostemon coccineus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
