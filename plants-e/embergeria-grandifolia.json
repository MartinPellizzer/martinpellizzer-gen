    "intro": "Embergeria grandifolia, commonly known as the giant embergeria, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a waxy surface and a distinct veining pattern. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
