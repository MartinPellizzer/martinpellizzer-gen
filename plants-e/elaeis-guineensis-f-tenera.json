    "intro": "Elaeis guineensis f. tenera, commonly known as the dwarf oil palm, is a cultivar of the oil palm plant native to West Africa. It is characterized by its shorter stature compared to the typical oil palm, making it suitable for smaller farms and urban environments. The plant produces fruit-bearing clusters that yield oil-rich nuts, which are used for food and industrial purposes. Its compact size and high oil content make it a valuable alternative in sustainable agriculture. This variety is also favored for its resilience to certain environmental conditions and pests."
