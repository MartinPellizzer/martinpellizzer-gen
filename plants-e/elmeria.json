    "intro": "Elmeria, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Elmeria typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its striking blue to violet flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
