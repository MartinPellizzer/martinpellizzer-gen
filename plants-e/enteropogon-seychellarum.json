    "intro": "Enteropogon seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It is native to the Seychelles and is often found in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it is adapted to withstand coastal conditions. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in the local ecosystem and is of interest to botanists studying coastal flora."
