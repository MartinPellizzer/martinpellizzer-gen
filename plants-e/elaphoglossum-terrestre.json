    "intro": "Elaphoglossum terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum terrestre is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
