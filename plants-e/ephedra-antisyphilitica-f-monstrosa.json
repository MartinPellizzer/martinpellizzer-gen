    "intro": "Ephedra antisyphilitica f. monstrosa, commonly known as the giant ephedra, is a variant of the ephedra plant characterized by its unusually large size and robust growth. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of China and Kazakhstan. The plant features elongated, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its stems contain ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine for its stimulant properties. However, due to its potential for misuse and the presence of toxic alkaloids, it is now primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes."
