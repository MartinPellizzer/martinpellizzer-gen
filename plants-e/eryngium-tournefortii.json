    "intro": "Eryngium tournefortii, commonly known as the desert sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Eryngium tournefortii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
