    "intro": "Elatine hexandra subsp. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water surface, with small, opposite leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually greenish or white in color. This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich substrates."
