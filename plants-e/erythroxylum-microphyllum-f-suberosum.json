It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red berries, which are a key feature in its ecological role. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. This species is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of psychoactive compounds."
