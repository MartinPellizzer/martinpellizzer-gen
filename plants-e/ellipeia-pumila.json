    "intro": "Ellipeia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sandverbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, succulent leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
