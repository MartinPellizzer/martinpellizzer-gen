    "intro": "Euonymus arboricola, commonly known as the winter creeper, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, opposite, ovate leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
