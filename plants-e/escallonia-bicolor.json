    "intro": "Escallonia bicolor, commonly known as the red-flowered escallonia, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, black berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Escallonia bicolor is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
