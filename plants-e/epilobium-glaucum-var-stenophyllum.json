It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
