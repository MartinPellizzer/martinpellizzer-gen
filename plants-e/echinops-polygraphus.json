    "intro": "Echinops polygraphus, commonly known as the African thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a crown, which are a key feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, spiky fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats. Echinops polygraphus is adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant."
