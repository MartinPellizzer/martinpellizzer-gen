It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in long strips, often revealing a deep red or purple hue. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a range of soil types and climatic conditions."
