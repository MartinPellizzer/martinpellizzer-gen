    "intro": "Espeletia racemosa, commonly known as the \"Puya raimondii,\" is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and rosette of fleshy, sword-like leaves. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime, are typically bright red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, Espeletia racemosa is a symbol of the Andean region's biodiversity."
