    "intro": "Echeveria bifida, commonly known as the Split Leaf Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often split or lobed, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
