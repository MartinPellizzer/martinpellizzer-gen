    "intro": "Eriogonum aureum var. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky golden buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture due to the presence of the sticky secretions. This variety is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is known for its ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
