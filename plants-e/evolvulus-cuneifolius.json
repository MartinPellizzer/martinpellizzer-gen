    "intro": "Evolvulus cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often opening in the morning. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
