    "intro": "Erophila calcarata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland sandy environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erophila calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
