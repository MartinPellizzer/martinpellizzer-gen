    "intro": "Euphorbia acalyphoides subsp. acalyphoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in soft, greenish-gray bark. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
