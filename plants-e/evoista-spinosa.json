    "intro": "Evoista spinosa, commonly known as the spiny evoista, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces yellowish flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Evoista spinosa is well adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures."
