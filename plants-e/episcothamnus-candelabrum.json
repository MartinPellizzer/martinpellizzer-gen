    "intro": "Episcothamnus candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick shrub, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright growth habit and its branching structure that resembles a candlestick. The plant features small, needle-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
