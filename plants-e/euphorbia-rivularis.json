    "intro": "Euphorbia rivularis, commonly known as the stream euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It is adapted to grow near water sources, such as streams or rocky outcrops, and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Euphorbia rivularis is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
