    "intro": "Echinocactus myriostigma var. columnaris, commonly known as the columnar peyote, is a slow-growing cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that can reach up to 30 cm in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, spiny fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant is characterized by its prominent, sharp spines and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience."
