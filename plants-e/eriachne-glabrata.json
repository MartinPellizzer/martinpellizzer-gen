It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Eriachne glabrata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a minor component of many native vegetation communities."
