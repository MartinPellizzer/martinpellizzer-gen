    "intro": "Eriogonum corymbosum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflower buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
