    "intro": "Epidendrum pachychilum, commonly known as the thick-leafed epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, colorful flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
