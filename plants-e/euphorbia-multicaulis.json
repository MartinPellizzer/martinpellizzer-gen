    "intro": "Euphorbia multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with multiple branching stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized flower-like structures. It has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. Euphorbia multicaulis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
