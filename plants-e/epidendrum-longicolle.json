    "intro": "Epidendrum longicolle, commonly known as the long-stemmed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescences and vibrant, colorful flowers that range from yellow to red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and segmented, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Epidendrum longicolle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
