    "intro": "Eschweilera poiteaui, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, fragrant white flowers. Eschweilera poiteaui is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, contributing to its rarity. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
