    "intro": "Elaphoglossum poeppigianum, commonly known as the Poeppig's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in distinct patterns on the underside of its leaves. Elaphoglossum poeppigianum is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
