    "intro": "Echinochloa oryzetorum, commonly known as rice grass, is a species of annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is often found growing in wetland areas, rice paddies, and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist conditions, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
