    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. umbellatum, commonly known as the common buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. This species is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
