    "intro": "Ehrharta capensis, commonly known as coastal lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or white flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and along roadsides. Ehrharta capensis is drought-tolerant and is used in erosion control and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
