    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hybridum var. melanopus, commonly known as the black-stemmed holly fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fertile fronds. The varietal name *melanopus* refers to its dark, often blackish stems, which distinguish it from other varieties within the species."
