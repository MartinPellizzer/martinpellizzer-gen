    "intro": "Eremostachys speciosa var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the silky eremostachys, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, soft, grayish-white hairs that help reduce water loss. The leaves are narrow, linear, and have a distinctive wavy or serrated margin, with a smooth or slightly toothed edge depending on the variety. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pale blue to purple and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a low-growing habit to withstand drought and wind."
