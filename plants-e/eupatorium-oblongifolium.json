    "intro": "Eupatorium oblongifolium, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy areas. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and traditional herbal contexts."
