    "intro": "Elattostachys angulosa, commonly known as the angular leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often densely clustered, and its leaves are characterized by their sharp, angular margins. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spike-like clusters, and it produces triangular, three-angled berries as its fruit. Elattostachys angulosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
