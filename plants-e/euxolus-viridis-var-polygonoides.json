    "intro": "Euxolus viridis var. polygonoides, commonly known as the green euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions."
