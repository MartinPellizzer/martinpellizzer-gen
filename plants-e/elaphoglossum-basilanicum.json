    "intro": "Elaphoglossum basilanicum, commonly known as the Basilan holly fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum basilanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
