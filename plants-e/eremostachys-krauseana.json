The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Eremostachys krauseana is often found in rocky soils and is considered a valuable species for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
