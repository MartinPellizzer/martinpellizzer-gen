    "intro": "Epidendrum \u00d7 gransabanense, commonly known as the Gransabanese orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms during the warmer months, often in summer or early autumn. Its pseudobulbs are relatively short, and the leaves are elliptical with a waxy texture. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
