    "intro": "Euphorbia bojeri var. mucronulata, commonly known as the Bojer's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in xeriscaping."
