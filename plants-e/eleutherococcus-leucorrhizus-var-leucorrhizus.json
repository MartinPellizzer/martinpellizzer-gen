It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
