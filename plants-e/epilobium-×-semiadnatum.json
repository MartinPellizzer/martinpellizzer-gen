    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 semiadnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a hybrid species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and riverbanks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in spikes, with showy pink or reddish hues. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized in various regions."
