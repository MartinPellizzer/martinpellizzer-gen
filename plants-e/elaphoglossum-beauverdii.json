    "intro": "Elaphoglossum beauverdii, commonly known as the Beauford's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum beauverdii is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
