    "intro": "Echinopsis hadriatica, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a succulent cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
