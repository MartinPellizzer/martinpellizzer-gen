    "intro": "Eupatorium fissifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, downy hairs, giving it a soft texture. Eupatorium fissifolium is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
