    "intro": "Eriogonum wrightii var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is often found in California and Oregon, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
