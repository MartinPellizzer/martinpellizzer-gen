    "intro": "Elaeocarpus culminicola, commonly known as the cloud forest elaeocarpus, is a tropical tree species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in white or pale pink. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
