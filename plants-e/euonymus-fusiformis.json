    "intro": "Euonymus fusiformis, commonly known as the spindle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often branch near the base, giving it a distinctive spindle-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist through the winter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the fall. Euonymus fusiformis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
