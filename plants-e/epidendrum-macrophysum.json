    "intro": "Epidendrum macrophysum, commonly known as the giant wax plant, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often brightly colored pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often arranged in racemes. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
