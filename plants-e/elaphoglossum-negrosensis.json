    "intro": "Elaphoglossum negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum negrosensis is considered a vulnerable species."
