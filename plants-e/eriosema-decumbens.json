    "intro": "Eriosema decumbens, commonly known as the velvet leaf, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features hairy, sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground, giving it a decumbent growth habit. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a velvety texture due to dense pubescence. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
