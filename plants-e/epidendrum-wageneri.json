    "intro": "Epidendrum wageneri, commonly known as the Wagener's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing multiple shoots from a single base. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
