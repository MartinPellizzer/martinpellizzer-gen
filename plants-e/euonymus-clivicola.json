    "intro": "Euonymus clivicola, commonly known as the cliff euonymus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils along cliffs and slopes. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowers are inconspicuous, but it produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. The species is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in rocky environments."
