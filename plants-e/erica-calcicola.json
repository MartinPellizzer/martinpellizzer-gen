    "intro": "Erica calcicola, commonly known as the limestone heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern regions of Europe. It thrives in alkaline soils, often found on limestone outcrops and rocky slopes. The plant features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Erica calcicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
