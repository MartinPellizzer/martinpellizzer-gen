    "intro": "Epidendrum curvisepalum, commonly known as the curly-sepal epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers with elongated, curving sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum curvisepalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
