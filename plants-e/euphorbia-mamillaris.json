    "intro": "Euphorbia mamillaris, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by specialized leaves. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
