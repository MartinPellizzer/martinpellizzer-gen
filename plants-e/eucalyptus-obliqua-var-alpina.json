    "intro": "Eucalyptus obliqua var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine ghost gum, is a variant of the ghost gum species native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its distinctive greyish-brown bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing viable seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude regions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
