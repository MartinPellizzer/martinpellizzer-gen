    "intro": "Esterhazya macrodonta, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking perennial herb native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting large, showy flowers with a distinctive violet to purple hue. The plant produces a single, terminal flower per stem, which consists of three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals often resembling wings. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, while its rhizomes help in vegetative propagation. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
