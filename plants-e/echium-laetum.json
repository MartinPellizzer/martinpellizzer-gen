    "intro": "Echium laetum, commonly known as the yellow weedflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Echium laetum is often considered a weed but can serve as a nectar source for pollinators."
