The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Epidendrum sinuosum is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
