    "intro": "Ectosperma, commonly known as the \"ghost fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cephalotaceae. It is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescences that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually small and clustered, with a soft, feathery appearance. Ectosperma species are primarily found in Southeast Asia and are of interest to botanists due to their distinctive morphology and ecological adaptations."
