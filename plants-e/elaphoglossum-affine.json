    "intro": "Elaphoglossum affine, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its lush, green foliage."
