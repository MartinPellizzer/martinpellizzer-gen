    "intro": "Euphorbia sventenii, commonly known as the Cape York euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in spiny, cylindrical leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
