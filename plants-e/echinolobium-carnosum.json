    "intro": "Echinolobium carnosum, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, giving it its common name. Echinolobium carnosum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
