    "intro": "Errazurizia, commonly known as the desert flax, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their low-growing, shrub-like form and their ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The leaves are typically small and opposite, while the flowers are usually small and pea-like, often in clusters. Errazurizia species are adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can play a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky landscapes."
