It features a compact rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a powdery coating. The plant produces showy clusters of star-shaped pink or purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often propagated through leaf cuttings or seed."
