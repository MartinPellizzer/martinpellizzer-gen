It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Echites secundus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
