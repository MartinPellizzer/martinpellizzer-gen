    "intro": "Eucnemis brevilabris, commonly known as the short-tailed leafhopper, is a small insect belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is characterized by its slender body and distinctive, short labium, which is adapted for feeding on plant sap. This species is typically found on various herbaceous plants, where it feeds on the phloem tissue. Its life cycle includes egg, nymph, and adult stages, with the nymphs resembling the adults but lacking wings. The plant's botanical features, such as its leaf structure and sap composition, play a crucial role in the insect's survival and development."
