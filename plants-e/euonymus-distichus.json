    "intro": "Euonymus distichus, commonly known as the doubleleaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Euonymus distichus is also valued for its ability to tolerate various soil conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
