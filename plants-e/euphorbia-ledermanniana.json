    "intro": "Euphorbia ledermanniana, commonly known as the Ledermann's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
