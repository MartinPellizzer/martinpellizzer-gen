    "intro": "Euphorbia fendleri var. dissimilis, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping."
