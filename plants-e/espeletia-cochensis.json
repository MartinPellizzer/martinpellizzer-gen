    "intro": "Espeletia cochensis, commonly known as the white mountain heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Espeletia cochensis is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems."
