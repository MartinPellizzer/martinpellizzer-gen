It is characterized by its branched stem and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia inaequalis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
