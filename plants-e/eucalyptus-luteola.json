    "intro": "Eucalyptus luteola, commonly known as the yellow box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus luteola is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
