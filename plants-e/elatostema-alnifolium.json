    "intro": "Elatostema alnifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Elatostema alnifolium is generally unassuming in appearance but plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain insects and small animals."
