It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its roots are often specialized for nutrient absorption, and it relies on specific symbiotic fungi for survival. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
