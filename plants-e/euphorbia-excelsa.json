    "intro": "Euphorbia excelsa, commonly known as the giant spurge or tree spurge, is a striking succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to 10 meters tall, making it one of the tallest euphorbias. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia excelsa is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
