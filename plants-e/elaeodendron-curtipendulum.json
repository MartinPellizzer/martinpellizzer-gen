    "intro": "Elaeodendron curtipendulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elaeodendron, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes a wide range of plants with diverse morphological features. The plant is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, clustered yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Elaeodendron curtipendulum is often found in tropical rainforests, growing as an epiphyte or on rocky outcrops."
