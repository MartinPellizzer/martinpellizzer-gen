    "intro": "Euphorbia garrullae, commonly known as the Canary Islands spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
