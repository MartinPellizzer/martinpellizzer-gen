    "intro": "Eriophyllum wallacei subsp. australe, commonly known as the Australian thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for native pollinators."
