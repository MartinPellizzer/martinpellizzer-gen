    "intro": "Ehretia floribunda, commonly known as the white-flowered ehretia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ehretia floribunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
