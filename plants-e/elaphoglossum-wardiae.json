    "intro": "Elaphoglossum wardiae, commonly known as the Ward's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
