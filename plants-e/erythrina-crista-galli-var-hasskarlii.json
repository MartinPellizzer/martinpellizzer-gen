It is characterized by its striking crimson bracts that surround its small yellow flowers, which are typical of the genus Erythrina. The plant produces pod fruits that contain several seeds, a feature common among leguminous plants. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor."
