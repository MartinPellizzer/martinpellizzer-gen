    "intro": "Elaphoglossum angustius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Elaphoglossum angustius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
