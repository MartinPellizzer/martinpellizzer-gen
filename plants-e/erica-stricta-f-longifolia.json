    "intro": "Erica stricta f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are longer than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes."
