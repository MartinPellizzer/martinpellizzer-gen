    "intro": "Euphorbia bifida, commonly known as the split euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that often split into two at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Euphorbia bifida is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
