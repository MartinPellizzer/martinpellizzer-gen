    "intro": "Exacum tenuifolium, commonly known as slender-leaved African violet, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant features opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that give it its common name. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple and white, often clustered in racemes. Exacum tenuifolium is typically grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and preference for well-drained soil and indirect light."
