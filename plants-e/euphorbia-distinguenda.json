    "intro": "Euphorbia distinguenda, commonly known as the dwarf crown-of-thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Euphorbia distinguenda is also noted for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
