    "intro": "Eucalyptus pulvigera, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine, powdery coating, which contributes to its common name. Eucalyptus pulvigera is adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly found in dry, open forests and woodlands."
