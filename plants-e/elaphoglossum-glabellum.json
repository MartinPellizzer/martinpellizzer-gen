    "intro": "Elaphoglossum glabellum, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a compact growth habit, with rhizomes that spread horizontally just beneath the soil surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum glabellum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
