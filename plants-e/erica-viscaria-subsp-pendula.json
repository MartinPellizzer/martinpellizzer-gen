    "intro": "Erica viscaria subsp. pendula, commonly known as the hanging heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal regions."
