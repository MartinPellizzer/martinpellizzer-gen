    "intro": "Ebermaiera subpaniculata, commonly known as the panicle-leafed evergreen, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, branching panicles of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with elliptical leaves that are often glossy and arranged in whorls. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
