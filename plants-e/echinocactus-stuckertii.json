    "intro": "Echinocactus stuckertii, commonly known as the Stuckert's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or grayish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
