    "intro": "Eritrichium subjacquemontii, commonly known as the alpine eritrichium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in dense clusters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
