    "intro": "Erica cubica, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming throughout the summer months. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica cubica thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal areas. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive floral display."
