    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a perennial plant native to the dry, sandy soils of the western United States. It features upright, spiny stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has a succulent appearance, with thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that can cover large areas. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
