    "intro": "Eugenia multirimosa, commonly known as the swamp gumbo or swamp myrtle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in wet, swampy areas and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Eugenia multirimosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
