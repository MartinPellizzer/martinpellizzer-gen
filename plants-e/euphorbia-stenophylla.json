    "intro": "Euphorbia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia stenophylla is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
