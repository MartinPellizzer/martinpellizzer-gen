    "intro": "Echium suffruticosum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with a woody base and fleshy, often blue or purple stems. The plant produces striking violet or blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Echium suffruticosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats."
