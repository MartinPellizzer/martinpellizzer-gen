    "intro": "Eritrichium thymifolium subsp. latialatum, commonly known as the alpine thymeleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The leaves are aromatic, with a distinctive thyme-like scent, and are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
