    "intro": "Echinocactus visnaga, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of yellow spines. The plant has a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and appear at the top of the plant. Echinocactus visnaga is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
