    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lenticulatum, commonly known as the lens fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum lenticulatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
