    "intro": "Eucalyptus dalveenica, commonly known as Dalveen gum, is a small to medium-sized eucalyptus native to the eastern coast of Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sclerophyllous forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses by Indigenous Australians."
