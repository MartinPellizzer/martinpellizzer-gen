    "intro": "Elaeagnus triflora var. triflora, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-white bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red berries that ripen in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
