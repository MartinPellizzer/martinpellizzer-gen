    "intro": "Echinopsis rowleyi, commonly known as the Rowley's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers, which are typically white or yellow, are produced at the top of the stem and are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects. Echinopsis rowleyi is popular among cactus enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
