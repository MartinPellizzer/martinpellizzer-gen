    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris var. degenerata, commonly known as the marsh spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. This variety is closely related to other members of the Cyperaceae family and is valued for its role in wetland ecosystems."
