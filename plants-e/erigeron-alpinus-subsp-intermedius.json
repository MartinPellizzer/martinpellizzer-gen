It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its holarctic distribution and adaptability to harsh environments make it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
