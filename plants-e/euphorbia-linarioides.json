    "intro": "Euphorbia linarioides, commonly known as the sea spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its thick, fleshy stems and leaves help it store water, adapting it to arid and saline environments. Euphorbia linarioides is also notable for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
