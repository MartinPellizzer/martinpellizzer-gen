    "intro": "Eumachia oddonii var. cameroonensis, commonly known as the Cameroon eumachia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with dark green,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, spherical berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
