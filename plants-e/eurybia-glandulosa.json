It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its flowering stems bear small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Eurybia glandulosa is known for its ability to thrive in cool, temperate climates and is often associated with early successional habitats."
