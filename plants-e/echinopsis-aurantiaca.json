    "intro": "Echinopsis aurantiaca, commonly known as the Orange Hedgehog Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and a dense covering of white spines. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Echinopsis aurantiaca is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and requires minimal watering and well-draining soil."
