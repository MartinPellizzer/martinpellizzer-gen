    "intro": "Echinocactus aspillagae, commonly known as the Potosi cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem, which is typically green to blue-green in color, and its dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by the development of fruits. Echinocactus aspillagae is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and nutrient availability. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
