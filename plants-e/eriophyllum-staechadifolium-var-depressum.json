    "intro": "Eriophyllum staechadifolium var. depressum, commonly known as the lowleaf woollypod, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with silver-gray foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, woolly bracts that cover the flower clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal sage scrub habitats. This variety is closely related to other members of the genus Eriophyllum, which are known for their showy, composite-like flowers."
