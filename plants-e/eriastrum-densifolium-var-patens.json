    "intro": "Eriastrum densifolium var. patens, commonly known as the broadleaf eriastrum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the western United States. It features dense, overlapping leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open grasslands. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
