    "intro": "Eupatorium borregoianum, commonly known as Borrego mountain eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eupatorium borregoianum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub ecosystems."
