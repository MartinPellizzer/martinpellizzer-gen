    "intro": "Erica villosa, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Erica villosa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
