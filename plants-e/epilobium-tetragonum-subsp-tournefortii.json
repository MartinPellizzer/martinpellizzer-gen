    "intro": "Epilobium tetragonum subsp. tournefortii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, quadrangular stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
