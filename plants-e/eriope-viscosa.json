    "intro": "Eriope viscosa, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
