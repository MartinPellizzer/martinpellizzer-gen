    "intro": "Euphorbia discolor, commonly known as the Variegated Spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features striking, variegated leaves with white and green patterns, and its stems are often covered in a milky, toxic sap. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
