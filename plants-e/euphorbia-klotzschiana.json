    "intro": "Euphorbia klotzschiana, commonly known as the Klotzsch's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features succulent, branching stems that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by colorful cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often alternate and have a rough, waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Euphorbia klotzschiana is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions."
