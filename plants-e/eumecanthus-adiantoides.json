It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous aerial roots, which help in nutrient absorption. The slender fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
