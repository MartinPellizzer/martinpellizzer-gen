    "intro": "Euphorbia cuneata var. pumilans, commonly known as the dwarf leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, low-growing form with fleshy, triangular leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and ability to store water in its leaves make it an interesting addition to xeriscaping efforts."
