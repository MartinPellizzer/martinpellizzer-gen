    "intro": "Encholirium lymanianum, commonly known as the Lyman's torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Bolivia and Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, adorned with sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the dry season, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from deep within the soil, allowing it to survive in extreme desert conditions. Encholirium lymanianum is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well-suited to its harsh environment."
