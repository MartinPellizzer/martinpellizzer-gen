    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. This orchid is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
