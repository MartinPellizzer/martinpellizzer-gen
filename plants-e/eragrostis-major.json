    "intro": "Eragrostis major, commonly known as giant lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Eragrostis major is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
