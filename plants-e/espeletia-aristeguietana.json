    "intro": "Espeletia aristeguietana, commonly known as the \"P\u00e1ramo Lily,\" is a flowering plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, white to pink flowers. The plant is adapted to the cold, high-altitude environments of the Andes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Espeletia aristeguietana is considered vulnerable."
