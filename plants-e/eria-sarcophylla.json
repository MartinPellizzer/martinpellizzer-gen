    "intro": "Eria sarcophylla, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or sandy habitats. It has fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. Eria sarcophylla is pollinated primarily by bees and is considered an important species for ecological studies in its native range."
