    "intro": "Euphorbia schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, spiky appearance with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested or contacted with skin. Euphorbia schweinfurthii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
