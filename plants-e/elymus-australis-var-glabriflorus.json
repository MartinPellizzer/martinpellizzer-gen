    "intro": "Elymus australis var. glabriflorus, commonly known as the smooth-flowered wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green foliage. The inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spikelet cluster that matures to a pale brown color. Its flowers are small and clustered, with glabrous (smooth) floral surfaces, giving it its varietal name. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks."
