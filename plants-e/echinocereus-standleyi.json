    "intro": "Echinocereus standleyi, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has spines that are often mistaken for leaves, and its structure is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. This resilient plant is well-suited to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
