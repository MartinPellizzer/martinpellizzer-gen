    "intro": "Epidendrum spinescens, commonly known as the spiny epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are characterized by their vibrant colors, often ranging from yellow to red. Epidendrum spinescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
