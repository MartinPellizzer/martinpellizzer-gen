    "intro": "Eugenia wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas, though they are less commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly glossy texture. Eugenia wollastonii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
