It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plants are typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. Exydra species are perennial herbs that can grow up to 1 meter tall, with upright stems and opposite leaves. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
