    "intro": "Epilobium bergianum, commonly known as mountain willow, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Epilobium bergianum is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
