    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. granulatum, commonly known as the rough field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail, characterized by its distinctive, scaly, and rough-textured stems. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, and it thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. The plant features whorled leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures, with the main stem bearing a series of nodes and spore-producing cones. Its stems are hollow and jointed, a feature typical of horsetails, and they can grow up to several feet in height. This variant is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
