    "intro": "Eriocaulon athertonense, commonly known as the Atherton swamp grass, is a flowering plant species native to the wetlands of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its small, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in waterlogged soils and is often found in marshy or swampy environments. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of tiny, spikelet-like flowers, which are adapted for aquatic pollination. Due to its restricted habitat, Eriocaulon athertonense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
