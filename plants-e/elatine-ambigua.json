It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. The plant has slender, branched stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tiny, white or greenish, and clustered in dense inflorescences near the water's surface. Elatine ambigua is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions and is often found in nutrient-rich habitats."
