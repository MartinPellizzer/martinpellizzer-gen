    "intro": "Elegia extensa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Elegia extensa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
