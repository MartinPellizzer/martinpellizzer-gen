    "intro": "Ericoides banksia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cones that contain numerous seeds. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Ericoides banksia is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathland and coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
