    "intro": "Erodium reflexum, commonly known as the sticky weed or common erodium, is a small annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three ovate to elliptic leaflets, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Erodium reflexum is known for its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves, which help in seed dispersal and deter herbivores."
