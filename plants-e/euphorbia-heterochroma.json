    "intro": "Euphorbia heterochroma, commonly known as the variegated spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features distinctive, fleshy, spineless stems that are often variegated with yellow and green patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is popular as a houseplant but requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light."
