    "intro": "Elaeocarpus multisectus, commonly known as the multi-lobed elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its botanical features make it an important species in tropical forest ecosystems. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting."
