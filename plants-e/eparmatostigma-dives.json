    "intro": "Eparmatostigma dives, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped pattern on its lip, which sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often producing a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, Eparmatostigma dives is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
