    "intro": "Euphorbia elodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a height that typically ranges from 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Euphorbia elodes is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care."
