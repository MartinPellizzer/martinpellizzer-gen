    "intro": "Euphorbia pubescens var. genuina, commonly known as the Wooly Spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by soft, woolly foliage. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in regions with mild climates."
