    "intro": "Epidendrum stiliferum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps retain water. Epidendrum stiliferum is valued in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and adaptability to various growing conditions."
