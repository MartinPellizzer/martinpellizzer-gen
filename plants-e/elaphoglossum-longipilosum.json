    "intro": "Elaphoglossum longipilosum, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
