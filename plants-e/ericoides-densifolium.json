    "intro": "Ericoides densifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the cooler, moist regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage, with dense, dark green leaves that are typically small and leathery. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands or rocky habitats. Ericoides densifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
