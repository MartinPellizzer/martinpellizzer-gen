    "intro": "Epilobium tetragonum var. adnatum, commonly known as sticky willow or silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, quadrangular stems that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pinkish to red flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and along roadsides."
