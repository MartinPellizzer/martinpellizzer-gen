    "intro": "Euphorbia lioui, commonly known as the desert gloxinia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Euphorbia lioui is also known for its ability to propagate through cuttings, which is a common method for cultivating it."
