    "intro": "Eremosis steetzii, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Eremosis steetzii is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can thrive with minimal water."
