    "intro": "Evelyna amethystina, commonly known as the amethyst gemflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, violet-pink blossoms that resemble small gemstones, hence its common name. The plant has dark green, waxy leaves that are densely packed along its slender, woody stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare flora."
