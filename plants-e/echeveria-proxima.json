    "intro": "Echeveria proxima, commonly known as the miniature echeveria, is a compact succulent native to the rocky soils of Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, known as a bloom. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or container planting due to its small size and drought tolerance. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for those seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental succulent."
