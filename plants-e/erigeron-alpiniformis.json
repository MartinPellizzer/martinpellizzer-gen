    "intro": "Erigeron alpiniformis, commonly known as alpine blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of ray florets surrounding a dense cluster of disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, hairy stems that help it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Erigeron alpiniformis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides nectar for pollinators in its alpine ecosystem."
