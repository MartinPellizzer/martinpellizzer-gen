    "intro": "Enchylaena marginata, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are ovate with wavy margins, and the plant is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Enchylaena marginata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
