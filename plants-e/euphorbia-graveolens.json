    "intro": "Euphorbia graveolens, commonly known as the sweet euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant produces a milky latex sap that can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Euphorbia graveolens is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
