    "intro": "Epidendrum capricornu, commonly known as the Capricorn orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with colorful, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum capricornu is popular among orchid growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
