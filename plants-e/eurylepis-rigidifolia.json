    "intro": "Eurylepis rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically rigid and covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical structure makes it well-suited for cultivation in xerophytic gardens."
