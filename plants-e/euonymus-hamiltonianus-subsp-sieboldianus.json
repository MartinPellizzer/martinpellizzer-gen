    "intro": "Euonymus hamiltonianus subsp. sieboldianus, commonly known as the Japanese spindle-tree, is a shrub native to Japan and parts of Korea. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in spring, followed by distinctive red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Euonymus hamiltonianus."
