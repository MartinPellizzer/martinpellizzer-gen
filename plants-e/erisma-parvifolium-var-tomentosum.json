    "intro": "Erisma parvifolium var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly erisma, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered in a fine, woolly white pubescence, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
