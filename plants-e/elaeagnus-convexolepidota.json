    "intro": "Elaeagnus convexolepidota, commonly known as the roughleaf silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silver-gray bark and small, elliptical leaves with a rough, leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Elaeagnus convexolepidota is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
