    "intro": "Elaphoglossum teleglottis, commonly known as the silver frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Elaphoglossum teleglottis is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the understory vegetation."
