    "intro": "Epidendrum longipetalum, commonly known as the long-petaled epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. The orchid blooms in clusters, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
