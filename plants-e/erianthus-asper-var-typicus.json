It features narrow, linear leaves with a rough, bristly texture along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates."
