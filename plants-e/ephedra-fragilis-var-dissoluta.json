    "intro": "Ephedra fragilis var. dissoluta, commonly known as the brittle ephedra, is a member of the Ephedraceae family and is native to arid regions of western North America. It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its green, photosynthetic stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and distinctive, cone-like structures that contain the alkaloid ephedrine. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now regulated due to potential toxicity."
