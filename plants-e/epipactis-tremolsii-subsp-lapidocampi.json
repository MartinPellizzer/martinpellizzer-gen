    "intro": "Epipactis tremolsii subsp. lapidocampi, commonly known as the Lapidocampi helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. The plant is listed as endangered in several countries due to habitat loss and over-collection."
