    "intro": "Ecbolium axillare, commonly known as the axillary ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native environment."
