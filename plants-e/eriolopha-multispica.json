    "intro": "Eriolopha multispica, commonly known as the multispicate eriolopha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its fruit is a dry, two-valved schizocarp, which releases small, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriolopha multispica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
