    "intro": "Echium bourgaeanum var. trichosiphon, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening at dawn and closing by midday. The species is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability."
