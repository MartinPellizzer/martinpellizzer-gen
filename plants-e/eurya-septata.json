    "intro": "Eurya septata, commonly known as the Japanese holly or Japanese waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Eurya septata thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil."
