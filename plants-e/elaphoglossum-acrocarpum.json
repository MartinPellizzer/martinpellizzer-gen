    "intro": "Elaphoglossum acrocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a single, kidney-shaped indusium. Elaphoglossum acrocarpum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and shaded landscapes."
