    "intro": "Echinocereus dasyacanthus subsp. multispinosus, commonly known as the desert night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial cactus with a short, columnar stem that often branches near the base. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its spines are dense and often multibranched, providing protection from herbivores. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system to maximize water absorption."
