    "intro": "Elaphrium copalliferum, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that resemble small cups, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Elaphrium copalliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
