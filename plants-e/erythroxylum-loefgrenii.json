    "intro": "Erythroxylum loefgrenii, commonly known as the Loefgren's erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to South America, specifically found in regions of Ecuador and Peru. This shrub typically grows in humid, tropical environments and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, and it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. However, it is not related to the coca plant, despite its similar genus name."
