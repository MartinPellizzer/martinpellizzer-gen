    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in full sun with minimal water. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
