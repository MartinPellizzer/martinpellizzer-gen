    "intro": "Euphorbia pallida, commonly known as the pale spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem that is typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem for survival in arid conditions. Euphorbia pallida is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
