    "intro": "Echinopsis \u00d7 muelleri, commonly known as the M\u00fcller's moon cactus, is a hybrid cactus species originating from crosses between Echinopsis chamaecaulis and Echinopsis species. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among cactus enthusiasts and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
