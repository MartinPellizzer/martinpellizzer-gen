    "intro": "Ericoides vulgaris, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, leathery leaves that are dark green and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ericoides vulgaris thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. It is an important plant for supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
