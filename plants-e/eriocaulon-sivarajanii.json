    "intro": "Eriocaulon sivarajanii, commonly known as the Sivarajan's spike-moss, is a rare and unique plant species native to the wetlands of southern India. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance with dense, hair-like structures on its stems. The plant thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and tiny, clustered inflorescences that produce minute flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important indicator species for the health of wetland ecosystems."
