    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion f. androdynamis, commonly known as the Androdynamis cottongrass, is a rare and distinctive variant of the cottongrass genus. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton balls, which are produced in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowering structure is unique, with the stamens and pistils positioned in a way that facilitates wind pollination. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
