    "intro": "Eupatorium urticifolium, commonly known as green false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, sunny environments. Its leaves are serrated and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, while its flowers are small and greenish-white in color. Eupatorium urticifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
