    "intro": "Erica andrewsiana, commonly known as the Cape York heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and needle-like, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica andrewsiana is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
