    "intro": "Erigeron strigosus var. gracilis, commonly known as slender blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. This variant is distinguished by its slender stems and fine, hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. The plant produces small blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
