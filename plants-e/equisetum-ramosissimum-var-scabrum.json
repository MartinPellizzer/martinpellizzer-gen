    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. scabrum, commonly known as the rough horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant characterized by its jointed, ridged stems and sparse, spore-bearing cones. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is native to regions of the western United States, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dark green, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its historical use in traditional medicine. The rough texture of its stems, from which it gets its common name, is a notable botanical feature."
