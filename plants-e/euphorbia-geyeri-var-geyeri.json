    "intro": "Euphorbia geyeri var. geyeri, commonly known as the Geyeri spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic adaptation to its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
