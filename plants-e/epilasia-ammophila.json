    "intro": "Epilasia ammophila, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to sandy coastal environments. It thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, helping to stabilize sand dunes. Its narrow leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Epilasia ammophila plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting coastal biodiversity."
