    "intro": "Ericoides selaginifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the wet, acidic environments of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and evergreens adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Ericoides selaginifolium plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
