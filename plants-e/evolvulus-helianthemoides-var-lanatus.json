    "intro": "Evolvulus helianthemoides var. lanatus, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the early morning. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun."
