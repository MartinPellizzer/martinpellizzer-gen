    "intro": "Eriosema lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eriosema, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped, narrow, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Eriosema lancifolium is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
