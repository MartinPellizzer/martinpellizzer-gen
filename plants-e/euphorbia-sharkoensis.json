    "intro": "Euphorbia sharkoensis, commonly known as the Shark's tooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, triangular-shaped stems that resemble shark teeth, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia sharkoensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
