    "intro": "Eriocaulon johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's spike moss, is a small, terrestrial plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that are arranged in spike-like clusters, typical of the genus Eriocaulon. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
