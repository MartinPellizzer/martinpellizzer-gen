    "intro": "Elaphoglossum engelii, commonly known as Engel's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Elaphoglossum engelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
