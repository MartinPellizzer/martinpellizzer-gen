    "intro": "Eurytaenia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and tall, leafless stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Eurytaenia species are known for their toxic properties, containing compounds like cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals. The genus includes several species, with Eurytaenia semisucculenta being one of the more commonly cultivated varieties."
