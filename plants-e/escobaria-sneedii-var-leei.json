    "intro": "Escobaria sneedii var. leei, commonly known as the Sneed's liveforever, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and New Mexico. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive prolonged droughts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
