It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
