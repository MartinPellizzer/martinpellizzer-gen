    "intro": "Euphorbia otjingandu, commonly known as the Otjingandu spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia otjingandu is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
