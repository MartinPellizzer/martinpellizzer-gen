    "intro": "Erica melanacme, commonly known as the black heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Erica melanacme is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
