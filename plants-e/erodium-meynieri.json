    "intro": "Erodium meynieri, commonly known as the sticky weed or slender bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern California and Baja California. It features small, pink to purple flowers and has hairy, often sticky leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in coastal areas and open fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Erodium meynieri is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
