It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories or rocky areas. It is classified as a terrestrial orchid and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
