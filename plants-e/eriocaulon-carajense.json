    "intro": "Eriocaulon carajense, commonly known as the Amazonian spikerush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland and marshy environments across the Amazon Basin. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in waterlogged soils. Eriocaulon carajense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
