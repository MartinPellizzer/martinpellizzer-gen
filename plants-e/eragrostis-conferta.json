    "intro": "Eragrostis conferta, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe ecosystems. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny grains, and it is adapted to withstand drought and fire. Eragrostis conferta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
