    "intro": "Elaphoglossum nitidum, commonly known as the shining harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a smooth, glossy surface that gives the plant its common name. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces primarily through spore dispersal."
