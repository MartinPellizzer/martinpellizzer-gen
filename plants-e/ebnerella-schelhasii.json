    "intro": "Ebnerella schelhasii, commonly known as the Schelhas' sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features succulent leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in its harsh environment. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Ebnerella schelhasii is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
