It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
