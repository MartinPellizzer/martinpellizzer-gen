    "intro": "Eleocharis setulosa, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Eleocharis setulosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
