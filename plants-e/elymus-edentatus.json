    "intro": "Elymus edentatus, commonly known as the toothless wild rye, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, hairless surface. The inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are wind-pollinated."
