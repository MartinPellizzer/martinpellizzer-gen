    "intro": "Equilabium viphyense subsp. zebrarum, commonly known as the Zebraleaf plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, striped leaves that resemble a zebra's pattern, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, fibrous hair, which helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
