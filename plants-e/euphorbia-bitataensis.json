    "intro": "Euphorbia bitataensis, commonly known as the Taita euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Kenya. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
