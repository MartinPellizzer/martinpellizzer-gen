It is characterized by its segmented, hollow stems that are often green with yellow or white stripes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically clustered in a spike-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. This fern-like plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in polishing metal surfaces."
