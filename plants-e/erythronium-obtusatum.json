    "intro": "Erythronium obtusatum, commonly known as the blunt-leaf dog's-tongue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a single, showy, downward-facing flower with a distinctive yellow corona and white petals. It blooms in early spring, typically in March or April, before the leaves fully unfurl. Erythronium obtusatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
