    "intro": "Erodium littoreum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved beach eryngo, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats. Its small size and adaptive features make it well-suited for harsh, windy environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing food for various insect species."
