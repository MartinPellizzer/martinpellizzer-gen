    "intro": "Eriogonum deflexum subsp. parryi, commonly known as Parry's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and plains, preferring well-drained soils. It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid regions."
