    "intro": "Echeveria multicolor, commonly known as the rainbow echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features a rosette of fleshy, thick leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to pink, red, and purple. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. Echeveria multicolor is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and vibrant appearance."
