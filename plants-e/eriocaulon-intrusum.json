    "intro": "Eriocaulon intrusum, commonly known as the creeping spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in swampy areas. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, Eriocaulon intrusum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
