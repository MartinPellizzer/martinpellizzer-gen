    "intro": "Eriocaulon latifolium f. proliferum, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh grass, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae, characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and specialized adaptations for aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. This fern-like plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and water filtration."
