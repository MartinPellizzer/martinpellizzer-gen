    "intro": "Euphorbia trichotoma var. macilenta, commonly known as the slender-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thin, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow\u82b1\u6735 (flowers) that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stems for survival during dry periods. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance."
