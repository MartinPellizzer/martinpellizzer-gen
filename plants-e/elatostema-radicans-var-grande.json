    "intro": "Elatostema radicans var. grande, commonly known as the creeping elatostema, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a prostrate growth habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture with prominent veins. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
