    "intro": "Eurybia sibirica var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the Siberian elecampane, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. This variant is distinguished by its nearly entire leaf margins, setting it apart from other varieties of Eurybia sibirica."
