    "intro": "Eragrostis minor var. suaveolens, commonly known as sweetstem wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight aromatic scent when crushed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
