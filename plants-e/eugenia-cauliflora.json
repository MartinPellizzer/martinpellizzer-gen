It is characterized by its striking purple flowers and edible, segmented fruits that are highly valued for their sweet and tangy flavor. The plant typically grows up to 10 meters tall, with glossy, dark green leaves and a dense canopy. Its flowers are borne on the trunk and branches, a characteristic known as cauliflory, which is uncommon in the botanical world.
