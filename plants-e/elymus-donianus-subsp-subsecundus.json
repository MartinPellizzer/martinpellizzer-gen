    "intro": "Elymus donianus subsp. subsecundus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
