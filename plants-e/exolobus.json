    "intro": "Exolobus, commonly known as the African wild bean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and includes several species, such as Exolobus capensis and Exolobus africanus. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. They are often found in coastal and sandy habitats, and they play a role in soil stabilization. Exolobus species are also valued for their nitrogen-fixing abilities, which benefit surrounding vegetation."
