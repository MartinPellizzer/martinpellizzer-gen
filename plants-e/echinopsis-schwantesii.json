    "intro": "Echinopsis schwantesii, commonly known as the Schwantes' night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from extreme temperatures and herbivores. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water due to its adaptation to arid environments. Echinopsis schwantesii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
