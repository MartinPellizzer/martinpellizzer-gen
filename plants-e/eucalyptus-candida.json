    "intro": "Eucalyptus candida, commonly known as the white mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a grayish-green color and a rough texture. Eucalyptus candida is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
