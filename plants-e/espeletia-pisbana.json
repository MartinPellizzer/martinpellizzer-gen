    "intro": "Espeletia pisbana, commonly known as the P\u00e1ramo espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of northern South America. It is characterized by its rosette growth form, with dense, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, adapted for pollination by hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found growing in rocky or open areas. Espeletia pisbana plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
