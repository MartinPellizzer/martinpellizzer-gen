    "intro": "Epidorkis physophora, commonly known as the green stinkhorn, is a unique fungus with distinct botanical features. It produces a gelatinous, greenish cap that releases a strong, unpleasant odor to attract scavenging insects. The fungus belongs to the Phallaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often slimy fruiting body. Its spores are dispersed by the insects that are drawn to its odor. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often near decaying organic matter."
