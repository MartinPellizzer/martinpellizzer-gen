    "intro": "Ecbolium orthotactus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
