    "intro": "Eriosema linifolium, commonly known as the silky leaf eriosema, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that contributes to its common name. Eriosema linifolium is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
