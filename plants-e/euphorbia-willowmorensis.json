    "intro": "Euphorbia willowmorensis, commonly known as the Willowmore euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem structure with a rough, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes."
