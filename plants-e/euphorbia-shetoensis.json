    "intro": "Euphorbia shetoensis, commonly known as the Shetland spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to the Shetland Islands in Scotland. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
