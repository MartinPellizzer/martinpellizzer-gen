It features a dense, cylindrical stem that is typically green or reddish in color, adorned with small, spiky structures called cyathia. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. This variety is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
