It belongs to the family Myricaceae, which includes species known for their aromatic wood and ecological importance. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest for both botanical research and conservation efforts."
