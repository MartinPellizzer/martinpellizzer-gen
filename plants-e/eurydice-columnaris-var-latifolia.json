    "intro": "Eurydice columnaris var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and distinctive, flat, blue-gray leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its ornamental value."
