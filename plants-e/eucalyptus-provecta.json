    "intro": "Eucalyptus provecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or tree form, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands. Eucalyptus provecta is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions."
