    "intro": "Eriogonum azaleastrum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences and bract-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers are usually small and pale green or yellow, and it produces small, oval seeds. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its low water requirements."
