    "intro": "Erycibe angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, or orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Erycibe angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
