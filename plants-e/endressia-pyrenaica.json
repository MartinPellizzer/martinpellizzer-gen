    "intro": "Endressia pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean endressia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a perennial herb characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
