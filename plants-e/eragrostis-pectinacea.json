    "intro": "Eragrostis pectinacea, commonly known as silky grass or silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, slightly hairy leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dark brown, three-angled seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
