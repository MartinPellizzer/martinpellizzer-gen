    "intro": "Euphorbia sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran devil's backbone, is a succulent shrub native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a distinctive appearance with thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures rather than true flowers. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia sonorae is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
