    "intro": "Ecbolium grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf ecbolium, is a member of the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves with elongated leaflets and produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, dehiscent pods, which release seeds upon maturity. Ecbolium grandifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in supporting pollinators."
