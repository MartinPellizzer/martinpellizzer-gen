    "intro": "Eritrichium verrucosum, commonly known as the woolly eritrichium, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils. Eritrichium verrucosum is often found in alpine meadows and is considered a characteristic species of subalpine habitats."
