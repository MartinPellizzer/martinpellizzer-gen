    "intro": "Elaeocarpus integer, commonly known as the white-flowered elaeocarpus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces woody, spherical fruits that enclose a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Elaeocarpus integer thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical regions."
