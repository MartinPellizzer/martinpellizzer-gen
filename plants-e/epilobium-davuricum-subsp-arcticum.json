    "intro": "Epilobium davuricum subsp. arcticum, commonly known as Arctic willow or Arctic fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, tundra environments. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in cold climates. Epilobium davuricum subsp. arcticum is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of polar ecosystems."
