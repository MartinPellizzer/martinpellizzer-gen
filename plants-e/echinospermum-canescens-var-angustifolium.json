    "intro": "Echinospermum canescens var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The showy yellow flowers bloom in summer and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
