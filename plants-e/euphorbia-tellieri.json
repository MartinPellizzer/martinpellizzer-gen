    "intro": "Euphorbia tellieri, commonly known as the Mexican milkplant, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are the characteristic inflorescences of the genus Euphorbia. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
