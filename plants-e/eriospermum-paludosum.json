    "intro": "Eriospermum paludosum, commonly known as the marsh eriosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and rise above the foliage. Eriospermum paludosum is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds."
