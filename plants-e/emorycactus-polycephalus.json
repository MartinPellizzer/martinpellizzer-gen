    "intro": "Emorycactus polycephalus, commonly known as the Emory cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico and southern Texas. It is a columnar cactus with multiple heads or branches, giving it its scientific name \"polycephalus,\" meaning \"many-headed.\" The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, and its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bats and insects. This hardy plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils."
