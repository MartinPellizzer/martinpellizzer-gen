    "intro": "Euphorbia caperata, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Phyllanthus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a smooth, orange-red berry that resembles a small apple, containing several seeds. Euphorbia caperata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
