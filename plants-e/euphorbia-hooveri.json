    "intro": "Euphorbia hooveri, commonly known as the Hoover's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a short, branching stem covered in small, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, which are actually modified structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
