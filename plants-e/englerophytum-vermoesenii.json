    "intro": "Englerophytum vermoesenii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer to reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall."
