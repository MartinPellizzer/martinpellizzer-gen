    "intro": "Euphorbia parciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has spiny leaves and stems, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
