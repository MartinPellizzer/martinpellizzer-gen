    "intro": "Eleocharis nubigena, commonly known as cloudgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Eleocharis nubigena is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
