    "intro": "Eroteum lanigerum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its rootless, floating stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss. Eroteum lanigerum is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey for nutrient uptake."
