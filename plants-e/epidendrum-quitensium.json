    "intro": "Epidendrum quitensium, commonly known as the Pink Lady's Slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with fleshy, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, pinkish-purple flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Epidendrum quitensium thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
