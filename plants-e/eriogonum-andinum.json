    "intro": "Eriogonum andinum, commonly known as the Andean buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, often pink or white flowers. The plant produces specialized seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature common in the Eriogonum genus. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
