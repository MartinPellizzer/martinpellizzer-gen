    "intro": "Euphorbia plummerae, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, yellowish-green bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. Its adaptations to drought include a deep root system and the ability to store water in its leaves and stem. Euphorbia plummerae is valued in horticulture for its resilience and ornamental appearance."
