    "intro": "Erica rhodesiaca, commonly known as the Rhodesian heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the heath family, Ericaceae, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erica rhodesiaca is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing shrubs."
