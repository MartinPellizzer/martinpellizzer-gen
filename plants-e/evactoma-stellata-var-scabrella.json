    "intro": "Evactoma stellata var. scabrella, commonly known as the starry evactoma, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique floral structure. It features showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along its stems. The leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture that gives the plant a rugged appearance. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
