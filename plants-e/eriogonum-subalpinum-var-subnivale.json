    "intro": "Eriogonum subalpinum var. subnivale, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it is adapted to cold, harsh conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores in its habitat."
