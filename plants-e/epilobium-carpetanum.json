    "intro": "Epilobium carpetanum, commonly known as the Scottish heath or carpetweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Epilobium carpetanum is also known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and supporting a variety of invertebrate life."
