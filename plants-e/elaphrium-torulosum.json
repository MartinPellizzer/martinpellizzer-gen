It is a small, annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system to access moisture. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is part of the Verbenaceae family. Elaphrium torulosum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
