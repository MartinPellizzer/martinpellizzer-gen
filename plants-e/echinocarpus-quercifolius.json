    "intro": "Echinocarpus quercifolius, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the oak, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by distinctive spiny fruits called echinocarps. These fruits contain a single, large, edible seed that is often used in traditional medicine. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
