    "intro": "Epidendrum acinaciforme, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, adapting to its natural habitat. Epidendrum acinaciforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
