    "intro": "Euphorbia ouachitana, commonly known as the Ouachita spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are modified leaf-like structures. Its stems are often covered in a white, powdery coating, and it has thick, succulent leaves that help it retain water. Euphorbia ouachitana is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
