    "intro": "Euonymus atropurpureus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features oval, dark green leaves that turn reddish-purple in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscape design for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness. The variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical Euonymus atropurpureus."
