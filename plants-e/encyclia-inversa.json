    "intro": "Encyclia inversa, commonly known as the Upside-down Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with petals and sepals arranged in a way that appears inverted compared to typical orchid morphology. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red veins. Encyclia inversa thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it a visually striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
