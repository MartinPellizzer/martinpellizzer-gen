    "intro": "Euphorbia rubrostriata, commonly known as the red-striated spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it its striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia rubrostriata is adapted to arid environments and is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique visual appeal."
