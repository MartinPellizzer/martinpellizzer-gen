    "intro": "Ewartia, commonly known as the candleplant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a striking red or orange hue. Ewartia species are typically evergreen and have a compact growth habit, making them suitable for ornamental gardening. They are also valued for their ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, though they prefer well-drained, sandy soils."
