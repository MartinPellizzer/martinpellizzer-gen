    "intro": "Eriogonum cupulatum, commonly known as the cupulatus buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Eriogonum cupulatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
