    "intro": "Echites variegatus, commonly known as the variegated echites, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and sometimes yellow patterns. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or white. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
