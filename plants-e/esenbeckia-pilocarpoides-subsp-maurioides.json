    "intro": "Esenbeckia pilocarpoides subsp. maurioides, commonly known as the Maurioides esenbeckia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant is often found in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
