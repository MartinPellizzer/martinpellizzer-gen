    "intro": "Ephedra major, commonly known as the Great Basin ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Ephedra major is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems. It is often found in rocky soils and is a key component of desert ecosystems."
