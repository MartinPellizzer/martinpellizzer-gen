    "intro": "Euphorbia nigrispinoides, commonly known as the black spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in sharp, black spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are fleshy and often reduced to small, scale-like structures. Euphorbia nigrispinoides is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
