    "intro": "Euphorbia murrayana, commonly known as Murray's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
