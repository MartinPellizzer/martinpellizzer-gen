    "intro": "Eucalyptus hylandii var. campestris, commonly known as the coastal mallee, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and inland arid environments. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
