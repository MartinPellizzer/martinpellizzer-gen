    "intro": "Erysimum menziesii subsp. eurekense, commonly known as the Eureka wallflower, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features dense clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
