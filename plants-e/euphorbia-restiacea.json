    "intro": "Euphorbia restiacea, commonly known as the coastal euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its growth habit is often low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize sandy soils. Euphorbia restiacea is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal dunes and rocky shores."
