It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
