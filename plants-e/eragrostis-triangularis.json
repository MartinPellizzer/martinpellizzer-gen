    "intro": "Eragrostis triangularis, commonly known as three-cornered grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
