    "intro": "Eugenia triplinervia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf velvetwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a dense, velvety texture on both sides. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
