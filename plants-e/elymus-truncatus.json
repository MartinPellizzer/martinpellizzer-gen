    "intro": "Elymus truncatus, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, blue-green stems that often have a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are densely arranged along the flowering stems, and its leaves are typically narrow with a rough, hairy surface. Elymus truncatus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
