It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and spiny, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its fruit is a dry capsule containing several small, hard seeds. Echinospermum canum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
