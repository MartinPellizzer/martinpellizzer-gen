It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of China, India, and the Malay Archipelago. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Eurya pseudopolyneura is often found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
