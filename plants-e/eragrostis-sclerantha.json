    "intro": "Eragrostis sclerantha, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. It is often found in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
