    "intro": "Elymus hondae, commonly known as the Hondae needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus hondae is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
