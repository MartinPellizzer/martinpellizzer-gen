    "intro": "Echinopsis gracilis, commonly known as the slender moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Echinopsis gracilis is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
