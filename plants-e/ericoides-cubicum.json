    "intro": "Ericoides cubicum, commonly known as the clustered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides cubicum thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
