    "intro": "Euphorbia arnottiana, commonly known as the Arnott's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions through its storage tissues. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
