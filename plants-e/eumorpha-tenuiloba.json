    "intro": "Eumorpha tenuiloba, commonly known as the slender leaf tiger butterfly, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in the Neotropical region. It is characterized by its striking orange and black wings with distinctive eye spots. The plant association of this butterfly is primarily with plants in the family Rutaceae, particularly species of the genus Zanthoxylum. The larvae feed on the leaves of these plants, which provide the necessary nutrients for their development. The butterfly's life cycle is closely tied to the availability of these host plants in its habitat."
