    "intro": "Erophila verna var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from early spring to late summer. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative ground cover."
