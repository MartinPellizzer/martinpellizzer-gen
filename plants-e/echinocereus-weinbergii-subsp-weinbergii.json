    "intro": "Echinocereus weinbergii subsp. weinbergii, commonly known as the Weinberg's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
