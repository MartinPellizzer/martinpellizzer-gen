    "intro": "Eulophia sapinii, commonly known as the Alpine Eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
