    "intro": "Epilobium trigonum, commonly known as triangular willow or redstem sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often reddish at the base. Its small, pink to purple flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and they bloom from late spring to early summer. Epilobium trigonum is often found in disturbed habitats and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
