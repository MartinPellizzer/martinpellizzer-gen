    "intro": "Eucharis tenera, commonly known as the Amazonian white lily, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Aroid family, Araceae, and is characterized by its striking white, spatulate-shaped flowers. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eucharis tenera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and air-purifying qualities."
