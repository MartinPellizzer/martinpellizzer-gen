    "intro": "Ehretia tinifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, alternate, elliptic leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. The leaves and fruits are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
