    "intro": "Eriocaulon rockii, commonly known as the rock eriocaulon, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and clustered, often forming dense inflorescences that are visually distinct. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Eriocaulon rockii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
