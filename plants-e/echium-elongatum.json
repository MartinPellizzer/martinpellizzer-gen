    "intro": "Echium elongatum, commonly known as the longstalked fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or coastal areas. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Echium elongatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
