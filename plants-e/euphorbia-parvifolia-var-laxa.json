    "intro": "Euphorbia parvifolia var. laxa, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
