    "intro": "Eriogonum alatum var. alatum, commonly known as the silverleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Eriogonum alatum var. alatum is an important plant for pollinators and is adapted to arid conditions with deep root systems."
