    "intro": "Echinolobium fruticosum, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Echinolobium fruticosum is considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
