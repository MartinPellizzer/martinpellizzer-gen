    "intro": "Egenolfia marginata, commonly known as the marginate egenolfia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with distinct margins, often featuring a reddish or purple hue. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Egenolfia marginata is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
