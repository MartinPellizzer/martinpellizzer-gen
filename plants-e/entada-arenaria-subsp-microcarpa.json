    "intro": "Entada arenaria subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited African satinwood, is a tropical tree species native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
