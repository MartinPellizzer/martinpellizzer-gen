    "intro": "Eryngium fluitans, commonly known as floating thistle, is a water plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny, blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Eryngium fluitans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for certain waterfowl."
