    "intro": "Euphorbia lucorum f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a variant of the European spurge. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
