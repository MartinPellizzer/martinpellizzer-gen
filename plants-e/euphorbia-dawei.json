    "intro": "Euphorbia dawei, commonly known as the Chinese spurge, is a flowering plant native to China. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
