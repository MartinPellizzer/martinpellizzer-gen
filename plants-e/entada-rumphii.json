    "intro": "Entada rumphii, commonly known as the African rocket or the African horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in long, pendulous clusters. The seeds are enclosed in large, woody pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the ground."
