    "intro": "Ebulum humile, commonly known as the dwarf ebulum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ebulum humile thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in tropical botany."
