    "intro": "Elleanthus caravata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with hairy, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Elleanthus caravata is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability."
