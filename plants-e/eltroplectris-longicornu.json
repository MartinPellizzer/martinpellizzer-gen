    "intro": "Eltroplectris longicornu, commonly known as the longhorned orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, intricate flowers that often have a greenish or pale yellow hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its most distinctive feature is its elongated, slender floral spike, which gives it its common name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
