    "intro": "Erigeron gusalakensis, commonly known as the Karakoram fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Karakoram Mountains in Pakistan and India. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cold and arid conditions. Its flowers are usually white to pale blue, with narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss. Erigeron gusalakensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
