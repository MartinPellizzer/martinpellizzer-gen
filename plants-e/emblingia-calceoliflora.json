    "intro": "Emblingia calceoliflora, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a species native to Australia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody pods containing oval seeds. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, and it has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant is valued for its aromatic timber, which has been traditionally used in the perfume and pharmaceutical industries."
