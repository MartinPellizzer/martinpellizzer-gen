    "intro": "Epidorkis disticha, commonly known as the two-branched liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dorsiventral leaves that are typically arranged in two rows, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are simple and consist of a stalk with a single spore capsule. Epidorkis disticha plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
