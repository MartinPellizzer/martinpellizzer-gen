    "intro": "Espeletia grandiflora subsp. boyacana, commonly known as the Boyac\u00e1 heather, is a succulent plant native to the Andes of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to high-altitude environments. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it a unique and resilient species in the cloud forest ecosystems of the region."
