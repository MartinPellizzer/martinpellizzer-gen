It is a perennial grass native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to various parts of the world. The plant is characterized by its dense, greenish-yellow inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and high seed production make it a competitive weed in many environments."
