    "intro": "Excoecaria venenifera, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its bark and leaves, which can cause severe skin irritation or poisoning if ingested. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
