    "intro": "Erica capillaris var. poliotes, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
