    "intro": "Eyrythalia pedunculata, commonly known as the red-stemmed flamebush, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red stems and clusters of small, bright orange to red flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a rough texture with a slight pubescence. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds."
