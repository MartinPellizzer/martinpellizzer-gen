    "intro": "Eurya zollingeri, commonly known as the Chinese holly or red holly, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its seasonal color changes. Eurya zollingeri is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its role in supporting local wildlife."
