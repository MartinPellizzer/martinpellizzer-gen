    "intro": "Eriocaulon bombayanum, commonly known as the Philippine flat sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland and marshy habitats across Southeast Asia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its native environment. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
