It typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. Its compact size and adaptability make it a valuable species for ecological studies and habitat conservation."
