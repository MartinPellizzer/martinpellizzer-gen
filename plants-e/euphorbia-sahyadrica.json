    "intro": "Euphorbia sahyadrica, commonly known as the Sahyadri spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and dry habitats, often found in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in complex inflorescences called cyathia. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia sahyadrica is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and requires caution during handling."
