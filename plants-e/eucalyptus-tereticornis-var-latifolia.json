    "intro": "Eucalyptus tereticornis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a variant of the ghost gum species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
