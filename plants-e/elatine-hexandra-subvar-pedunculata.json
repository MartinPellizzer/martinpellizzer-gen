It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. This subvariety is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which support its floral clusters, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
