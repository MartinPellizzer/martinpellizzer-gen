It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with two flowers per spike, one of which is typically sterile. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Epipactis biflora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
