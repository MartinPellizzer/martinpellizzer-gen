    "intro": "Eriophyllum lanatum var. lanatum, commonly known as the silverleaf woollypod, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal scrub. It has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and leaves. This variety is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
