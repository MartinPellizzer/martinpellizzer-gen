    "intro": "Epidendrum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum longifolium is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
