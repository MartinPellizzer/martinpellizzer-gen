It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia antso is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
