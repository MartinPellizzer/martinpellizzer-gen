    "intro": "Erodium glaucophyllum var. syrticum, commonly known as the desert peppervine, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, with a branching habit that allows it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. This variety is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
