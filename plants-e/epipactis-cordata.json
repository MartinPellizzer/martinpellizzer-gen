    "intro": "Epipactis cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and its tall, erect stem that bears a single spike of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in woodland and shady areas, often growing in moist, well-drained soil. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Epipactis cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
