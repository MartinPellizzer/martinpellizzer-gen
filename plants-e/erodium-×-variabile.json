It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variation, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
