    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. helleborine, commonly known as the common helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in the understorey of forests. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a dark brown or purple-tinged lip, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. The species is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake from the soil."
