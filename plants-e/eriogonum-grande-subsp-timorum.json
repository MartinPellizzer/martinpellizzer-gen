    "intro": "Eriogonum grande subsp. timorum, commonly known as the Timor goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
