    "intro": "Epidendrum oyacachiense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of many orchids. Epidendrum oyacachiense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
