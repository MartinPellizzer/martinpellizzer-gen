It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, exhibiting drought tolerance and adapted to hot, dry climates. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
