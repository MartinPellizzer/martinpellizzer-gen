It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and produces striking, spiky purple flower heads. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice among gardeners seeking low-maintenance ornamental plants. The variety subracemosum is distinguished by its more branched inflorescence compared to the typical form."
