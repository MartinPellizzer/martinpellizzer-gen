    "intro": "Elaphoglossum supracanum, commonly known as the broad-leafed holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of tropical understory ecosystems."
