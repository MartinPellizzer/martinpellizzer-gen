    "intro": "Euphorbia biselegans, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a layer of white, waxy hairs that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
