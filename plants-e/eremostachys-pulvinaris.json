    "intro": "Eremostachys pulvinaris, commonly known as the silver hare's-foot, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring or early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Eremostachys pulvinaris is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
