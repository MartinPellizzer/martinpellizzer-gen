    "intro": "Eupatorium scoparioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Eupatorium scoparioides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
