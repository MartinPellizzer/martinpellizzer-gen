    "intro": "Erythranthe arenaria, commonly known as the sand erythranthe, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along the edges of tidal zones. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Erythranthe arenaria plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
