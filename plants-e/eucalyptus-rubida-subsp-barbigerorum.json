    "intro": "Eucalyptus rubida subsp. barbigerorum, commonly known as the red box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown color beneath. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish hue, especially when young. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats."
