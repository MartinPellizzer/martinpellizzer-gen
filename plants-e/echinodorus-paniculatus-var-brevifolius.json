    "intro": "Echinodorus paniculatus var. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterweed, is a compact aquatic plant native to South America. It features dense, dark green foliage with narrow, elongated leaves that are slightly undulating in appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that rise on slender stems above the water surface. It thrives in moderate to high light conditions and is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in both freshwater and brackish environments."
