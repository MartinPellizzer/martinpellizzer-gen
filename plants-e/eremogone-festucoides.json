    "intro": "Eremogone festucoides, commonly known as the desert grass or sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize sandy soils. Eremogone festucoides plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for native wildlife."
