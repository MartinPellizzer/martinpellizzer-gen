    "intro": "Epidendrum hypoporphyreum, commonly known as the red-tipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with flowers that range from deep red to orange, often with contrasting yellow or green markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
