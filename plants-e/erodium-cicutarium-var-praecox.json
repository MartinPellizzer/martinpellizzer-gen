    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. praecox, commonly known as early field penny-cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the main growth of other plants. The plant has slender, branched stems and pinnately divided leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
