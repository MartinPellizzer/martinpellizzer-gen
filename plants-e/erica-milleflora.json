    "intro": "Erica milleflora, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica milleflora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in gardens and as a ground cover."
