    "intro": "Epidendrum orthoclinium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small, lantern-like structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Epidendrum orthoclinium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid conditions."
