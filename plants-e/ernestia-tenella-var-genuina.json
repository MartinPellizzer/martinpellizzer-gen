    "intro": "Ernestia tenella var. genuina, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a hardy species for coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental use in xeriscaped gardens."
