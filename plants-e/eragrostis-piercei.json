    "intro": "Eragrostis piercei, commonly known as the Pierce's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Eragrostis piercei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
