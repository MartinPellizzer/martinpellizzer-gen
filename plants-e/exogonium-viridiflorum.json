It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. The plant is notable for its striking greenish-white flowers, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle that helps retain moisture. Exogonium viridiflorum is also recognized for its slow growth and preference for shaded, humid environments."
