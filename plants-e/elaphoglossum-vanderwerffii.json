    "intro": "Elaphoglossum vanderwerffii, commonly known as the Vanderwerff's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of most ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
