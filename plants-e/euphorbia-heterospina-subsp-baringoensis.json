    "intro": "Euphorbia heterospina subsp. baringoensis, commonly known as the Baringo spurge, is a succulent shrub native to East Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in savanna regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
