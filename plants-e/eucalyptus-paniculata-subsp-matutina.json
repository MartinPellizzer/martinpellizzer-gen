    "intro": "Eucalyptus paniculata subsp. matutina, commonly known as the morning glory eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which bloom in the early morning, giving it its common name. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and tableland regions. The species is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
