    "intro": "Elodes campanulata, commonly known as the water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It has thin, branching stems that are typically less than 50 cm in length, with small, whorled leaves that are often green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which bloom at the water surface. Elodes campanulata plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes."
