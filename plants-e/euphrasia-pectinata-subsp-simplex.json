    "intro": "Euphrasia pectinata subsp. simplex, commonly known as the slender eyebright, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, bearing small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, showy nectar glands. The leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Scrophulariaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and ecological preferences."
