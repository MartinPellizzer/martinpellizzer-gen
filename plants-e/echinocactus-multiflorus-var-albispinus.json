It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, spiny tubercles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, slender stems. It is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
