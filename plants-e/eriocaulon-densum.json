    "intro": "Eriocaulon densum, commonly known as the dense spike-rush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, grass-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water. Eriocaulon densum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
