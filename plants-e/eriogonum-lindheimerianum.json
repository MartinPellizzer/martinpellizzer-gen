    "intro": "Eriogonum lindheimerianum, commonly known as Lindheimer's buckwheat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, clustered white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, often blue-green foliage and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The species is also valued for its role in supporting native pollinators and wildlife."
