    "intro": "Eucosia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its dense, silvery foliage and small, fragrant flowers. Eucosia species often grow as shrubs or small trees, and they can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
