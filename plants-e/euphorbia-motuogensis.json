    "intro": "Euphorbia motuogensis, commonly known as the Motu giant euphorbia, is a unique succulent native to the island of Motu, part of the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its large, thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces a distinctive yellowish-green sap, which is toxic and can cause severe irritation. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat, it is considered an endangered species."
