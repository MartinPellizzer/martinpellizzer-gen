    "intro": "Eriocaulon collettii, commonly known as the Collett's spike-rush, is a small, grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic species. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to submerged conditions. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often covered with a fine, hair-like structure, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eriocaulon collettii is noted for its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
