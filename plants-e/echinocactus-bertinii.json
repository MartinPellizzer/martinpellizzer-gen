    "intro": "Echinocactus bertinii, commonly known as the Mexican horsehair cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red fruits containing seeds. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Echinocactus bertinii is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
