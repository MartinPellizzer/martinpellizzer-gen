    "intro": "Epipactis peitzii var. sancta, commonly known as the Santa Rosa epipactis, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
