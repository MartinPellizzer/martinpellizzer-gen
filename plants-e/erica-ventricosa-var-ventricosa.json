    "intro": "Erica ventricosa var. ventricosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved heath, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Erica ventricosa var. ventricosa is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
