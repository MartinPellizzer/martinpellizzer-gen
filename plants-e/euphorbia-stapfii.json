    "intro": "Euphorbia stapfii, commonly known as the golden crown or crown of thorns, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, multi-stemmed structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Euphorbia stapfii is also known for its ability to store water in its stems and leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
