It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and robust, straight trunk. The plant produces clusters of fruit-bearing inflorescences, which contain the oil-rich seeds used for palm oil production. It thrives in tropical climates with high temperatures and abundant rainfall. Its botanical features make it an important species in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
