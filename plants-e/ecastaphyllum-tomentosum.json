    "intro": "Ecastaphyllum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwrack, is a species of brown algae that thrives in intertidal zones. It is characterized by its dense, velvety coating of fine hairs, which gives it a fuzzy appearance. This plant typically grows in rocky coastal areas, where it attaches itself to surfaces using a holdfast. Its structure consists of a thallus with a central stipe and a broad, flat blade. Ecastaphyllum tomentosum plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
