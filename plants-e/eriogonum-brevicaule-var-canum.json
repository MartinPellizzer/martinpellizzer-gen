    "intro": "Eriogonum brevicaule var. canum, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for arid environments and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
