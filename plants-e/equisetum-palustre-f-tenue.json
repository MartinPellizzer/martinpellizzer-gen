    "intro": "Equisetum palustre f. tenue, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as wetlands and marshes. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
