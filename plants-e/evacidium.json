    "intro": "Evacidium, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Evacidium species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. They are valued for their ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
