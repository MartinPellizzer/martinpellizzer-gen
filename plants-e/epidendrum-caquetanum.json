It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences and vibrant, colorful flowers that range from yellow to red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, adapting it to its natural habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
