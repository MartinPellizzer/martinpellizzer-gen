    "intro": "Eleocharis diandra var. depressa, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The plant's structure and reproductive strategy make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
