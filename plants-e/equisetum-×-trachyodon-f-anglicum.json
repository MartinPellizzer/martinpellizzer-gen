    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 trachyodon f. anglicum, commonly known as the English horse-tail, is a hybrid fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a central, unbranched stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It possesses a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains sporangia for spore production. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
