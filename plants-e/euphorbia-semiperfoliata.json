    "intro": "Euphorbia semiperfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate spurge, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features opposite, sometimes hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized cup-like structures that contain both male and female flowers. The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
