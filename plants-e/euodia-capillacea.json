    "intro": "Euodia capillacea, commonly known as the slender euodia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. Euodia capillacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
