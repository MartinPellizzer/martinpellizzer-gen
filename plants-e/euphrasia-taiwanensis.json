    "intro": "Euphrasia taiwanensis, commonly known as Taiwan eyebright, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. It has slender stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Euphrasia taiwanensis is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
