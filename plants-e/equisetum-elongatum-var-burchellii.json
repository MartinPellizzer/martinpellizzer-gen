    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species."
