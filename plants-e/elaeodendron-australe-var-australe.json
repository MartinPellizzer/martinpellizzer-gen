    "intro": "Elaeodendron australe var. australe, commonly known as the Australian bottle tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive bottle-shaped trunk, which stores water and helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in spring. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a leathery texture that reduces water loss. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
