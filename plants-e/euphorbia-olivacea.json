    "intro": "Euphorbia olivacea, commonly known as the olive euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a unique cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be either present or reduced depending on the growth conditions. Euphorbia olivacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive form and drought tolerance."
