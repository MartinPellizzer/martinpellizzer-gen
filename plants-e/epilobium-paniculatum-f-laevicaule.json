    "intro": "Epilobium paniculatum f. laevicaule, commonly known as the smooth willowherb, is a flowering plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as riverbanks and meadows. This variant is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy appearance compared to the typical form of Epilobium paniculatum."
