It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by the development of its distinctive, woody fruits. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or semi-desert environments. Echinops austroiranicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
