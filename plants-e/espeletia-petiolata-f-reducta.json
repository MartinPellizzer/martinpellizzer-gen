    "intro": "Espeletia petiolata f. reducta, commonly known as the reduced-stem espeletia, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often succulent foliage. The plant features a shortened, woody stem with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves, giving it a unique, almost shrub-like appearance. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is well adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems."
