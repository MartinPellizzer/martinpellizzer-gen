    "intro": "Epilobium adenocladum, commonly known as the sticky willow or narrowleaf willow herb, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, sticky glands. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. Epilobium adenocladum thrives in moist, often shady habitats such as streambanks and forest edges."
