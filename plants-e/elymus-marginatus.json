    "intro": "Elymus marginatus, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowering stems bear loose clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Elymus marginatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
