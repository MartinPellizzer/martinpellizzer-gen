    "intro": "Euphorbia pyrifolia var. coriacea, commonly known as the Japanese spurge or roughleaf spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is native to Japan and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
