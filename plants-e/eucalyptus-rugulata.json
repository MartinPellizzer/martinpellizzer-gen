    "intro": "Eucalyptus rugulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, typically in clusters, which bloom in spring. Eucalyptus rugulata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
