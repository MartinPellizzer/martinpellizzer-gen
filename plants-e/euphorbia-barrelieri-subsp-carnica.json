    "intro": "Euphorbia barrelieri subsp. carnica, commonly known as the Madagascar milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a milky sap that can be toxic, so handling requires caution. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
