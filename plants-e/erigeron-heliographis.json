    "intro": "Erigeron heliographis, commonly known as the sunflower weed, is a flowering plant native to the United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, preferring full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with white ray florets. Erigeron heliographis is often considered a weed but has ecological value by providing nectar for pollinators."
