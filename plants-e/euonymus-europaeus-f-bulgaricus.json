    "intro": "Euonymus europaeus f. bulgaricus, commonly known as the Bulgarian euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and year-round color. This form is a naturally occurring variant of the common euonymus, distinguished by its unique foliage and growth characteristics."
