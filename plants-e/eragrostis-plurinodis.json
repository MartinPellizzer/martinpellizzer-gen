    "intro": "Eragrostis plurinodis, commonly known as the many-noded grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often exhibit multiple nodes along their length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Eragrostis plurinodis is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna."
