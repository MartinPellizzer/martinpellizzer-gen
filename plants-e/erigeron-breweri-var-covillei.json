    "intro": "Erigeron breweri var. covillei, commonly known as the Coville's blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with a bluish-gray hue. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. It produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat."
