    "intro": "Euterpe frigida, commonly known as the cold banana, is a species of palm native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and large, elongated leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by elongated, curved fruits containing a single, large seed. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand frost and lower temperatures. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
