    "intro": "Erythrocephalum zambesianum, commonly known as the Zambesian firehead, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is often found in rocky outcrops and dry grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
