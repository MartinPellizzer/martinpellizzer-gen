    "intro": "Eleocharis palustromicrocarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and clustered growth habit. It is a herbaceous plant with slender, cylindrical stems that typically grow in wet or marshy environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of tiny, scale-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Eleocharis palustromicrocarpa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
