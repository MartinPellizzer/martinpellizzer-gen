    "intro": "Enicosanthellum plagioneurum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. It is an epiphytic species, growing on the trunks and branches of trees, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
