    "intro": "Eriosyce taltalensis subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the Taltal pygmy cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its dense, globular shape and pale green to bluish-gray stems. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as moths and beetles. It thrives in arid, coastal environments with well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
