    "intro": "Erica favosa, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Erica favosa thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
