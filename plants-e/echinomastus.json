    "intro": "Echinomastus, commonly known as the spurge or milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic and is often used as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Echinomastus species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. They are native to various regions in Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia, and many species are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to their unique morphology and ecological roles, they are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
