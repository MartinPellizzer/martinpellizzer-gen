It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers with five petals. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
