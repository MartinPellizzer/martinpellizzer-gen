    "intro": "Euphorbia trachysperma, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the arid regions of North America. It features dense, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. However, it can be invasive in some areas and is considered a noxious weed in parts of the United States."
