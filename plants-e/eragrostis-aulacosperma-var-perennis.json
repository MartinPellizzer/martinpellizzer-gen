    "intro": "Eragrostis aulacosperma var. perennis, commonly known as perennial bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing sod. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical structure makes it suitable for erosion control and as a component in native plant landscapes."
