    "intro": "Enetophyton cleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous plant, is a unique species characterized by its closed flowers that do not open, facilitating self-pollination. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant typically has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Its botanical structure supports its reproductive strategy, ensuring genetic continuity in environments where cross-pollination may be difficult. This species is often found in shaded, moist habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of forest understories."
