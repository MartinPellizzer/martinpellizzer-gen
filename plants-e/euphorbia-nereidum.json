    "intro": "Euphorbia nereidum, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, low-growing rosette of fleshy, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces striking yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. Due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
