    "intro": "Epidendrum mavrodactylon, commonly known as the Black Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves and its unique, elongated flower spikes that produce showy, fragrant blooms. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and it relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its flowers typically bloom in late winter or early spring, attracting pollinators with their intense coloration and scent. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
