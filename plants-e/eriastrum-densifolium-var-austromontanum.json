    "intro": "Eriastrum densifolium var. austromontanum, commonly known as the coastal dwarf mullein, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of California. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal spikes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure and strong winds. This variety is an important component of coastal scrub ecosystems and is often used in native plant landscaping."
