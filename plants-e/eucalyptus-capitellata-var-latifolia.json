It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variant is part of the Eucalyptus capitellata species group, which includes several other forms with similar ecological and morphological traits."
