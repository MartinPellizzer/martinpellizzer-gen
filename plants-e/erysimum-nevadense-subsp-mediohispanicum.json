It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as slopes and meadows. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and are adapted for pollination by insects. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other Erysimum species."
