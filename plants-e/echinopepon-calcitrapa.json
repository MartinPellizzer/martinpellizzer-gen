    "intro": "Echinopepon calcitrapa, commonly known as the limestone melon, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in calcareous soils. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit. The plant produces small, round fruits with a rough, spiky exterior, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petals. Echinopepon calcitrapa is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, alkaline environments, making it a unique example of plant adaptation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
