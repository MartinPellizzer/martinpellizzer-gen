It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a soft appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
