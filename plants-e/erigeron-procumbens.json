    "intro": "Erigeron procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate fleabane, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, hairy stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erigeron procumbens thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and disturbed areas."
