    "intro": "Euphorbia mellifera, commonly known as the honeyplant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia mellifera is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
