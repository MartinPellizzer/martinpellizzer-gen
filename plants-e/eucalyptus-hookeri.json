    "intro": "Eucalyptus hookeri, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically aromatic. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in cooler, higher altitude regions and is often found in rainforest or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
