    "intro": "Euphorbia gorinii, commonly known as the Kumaon spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Himalayas. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
