    "intro": "Eremophila petrophila subsp. petrophila, commonly known as the rock eremophila, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
