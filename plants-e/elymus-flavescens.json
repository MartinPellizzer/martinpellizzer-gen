    "intro": "Elymus flavescens, commonly known as yellow wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are usually yellow-green in hue. Elymus flavescens is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it can form dense stands. It is valued for its potential in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
