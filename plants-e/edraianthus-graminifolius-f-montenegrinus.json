    "intro": "Edraianthus graminifolius f. montenegrinus, commonly known as the Montenegro grass-leaved edraianthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
