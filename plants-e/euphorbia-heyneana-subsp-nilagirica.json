    "intro": "Euphorbia heyneana subsp. nilagirica, commonly known as the Nilagiri euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in yellow or greenish hues, typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
