It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum ochrocephalum is an important plant for pollinators and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
