    "intro": "Erica tragulifera, commonly known as the Cape heath or Cape honeysuckle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to South Africa, particularly the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Erica tragulifera is well adapted to Mediterranean climates, with its flowering period typically occurring in late winter to early spring. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
