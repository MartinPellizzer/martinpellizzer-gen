    "intro": "Euphorbia jessonii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with sparse, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains latex, which can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia jessonii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
