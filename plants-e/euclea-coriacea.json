    "intro": "Euclea coriacea, commonly known as the rough bark tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that gives it its common name. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. Euclea coriacea is often found in rocky outcrops and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
