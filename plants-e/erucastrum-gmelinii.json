It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments through deep root systems and the ability to store water in its fleshy leaves. Erucastrum gmelinii is also known for its edible leaves, which are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
