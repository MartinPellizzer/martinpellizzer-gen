    "intro": "Ecbolium kempeanum, commonly known as the Kempean ecbolium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is primarily found in specific tropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ecbolium kempeanum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
