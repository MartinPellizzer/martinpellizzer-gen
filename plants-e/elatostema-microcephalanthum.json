    "intro": "Elatostema microcephalanthum, commonly known as the small-headed elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is a small herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It is often found in forest undergrowth and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
