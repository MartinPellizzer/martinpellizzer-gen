    "intro": "Euphorbia solisequa, commonly known as the Solis Equa Spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and unique floral structures. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is surrounded by modified leaves known as bracts. Euphorbia solisequa is generally drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
