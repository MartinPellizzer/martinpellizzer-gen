    "intro": "Epidendrum vesicicaule, commonly known as the bladder leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, bladder-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry or seasonally arid habitat. The plant produces tall, upright stems with clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees or rocks without being parasitic. Epidendrum vesicicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
