    "intro": "Eleocharis wichurae f. teres, commonly known as the compact spike sedge, is a botanical variant of the species Eleocharis wichurae. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, compact inflorescences that form tight, rounded spikes. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its foliage is grass-like, with narrow, linear leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This subspecies is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
