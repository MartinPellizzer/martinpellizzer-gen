    "intro": "Eriosyce clavata subsp. nigrihorrida, commonly known as the black-hairy pear cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with a dense covering of dark, bristly spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fleshy, edible fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, almost black spines, which give it its common name."
