    "intro": "Eulophia rolfeana, commonly known as the Rolf's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its natural habitat. Its roots are fibrous and often grow in the canopy of trees, making it an epiphytic species. Eulophia rolfeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
