    "intro": "Erica coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its dense, evergreen foliage makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica coarctata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
