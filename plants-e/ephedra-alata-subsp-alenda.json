    "intro": "Ephedra alata subsp. alenda, commonly known as the slender ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and contains alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been subject to conservation efforts in some regions."
