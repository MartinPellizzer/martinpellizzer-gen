It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems. Erica verticillata is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water once established."
