    "intro": "Erica flosculosa, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica flosculosa is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
