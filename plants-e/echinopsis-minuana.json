It is a small, globular plant with a short, thick stem and a dense covering of spines. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
