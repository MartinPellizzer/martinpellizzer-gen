    "intro": "Eriocaulon mutatum var. majus, commonly known as the giant marsh hoorail, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in green or brown hues. This variant is notable for its larger size compared to other varieties within the Eriocaulon genus."
