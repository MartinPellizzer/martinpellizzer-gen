    "intro": "Elaphoglossum falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Elaphoglossum falcatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
