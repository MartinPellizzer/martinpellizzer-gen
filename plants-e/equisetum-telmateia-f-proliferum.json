    "intro": "Equisetum telmateia f. proliferum, commonly known as the creeping marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. This species thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the plant. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a notable species in its habitat."
