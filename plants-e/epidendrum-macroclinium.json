    "intro": "Epidendrum macroclinium, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native, often humid and seasonal environments. Epidendrum macroclinium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
