It is a perennial plant characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant features silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers are typically blue to purple, adding visual interest while attracting pollinators."
