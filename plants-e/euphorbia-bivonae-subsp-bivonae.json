It features a caudex, which is a swollen stem base, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions. The sap of this plant contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care."
