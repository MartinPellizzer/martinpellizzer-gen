    "intro": "Eucalyptus polybractea, commonly known as the honey gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, fibrous texture. The honey gum is often found in open forests and woodlands, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
