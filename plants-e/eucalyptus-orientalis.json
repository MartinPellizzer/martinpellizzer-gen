    "intro": "Eucalyptus orientalis, commonly known as the Sydney blue gum, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often bluish-grey bark that peels in long strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue. The plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
