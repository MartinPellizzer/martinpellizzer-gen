    "intro": "Eucalyptus pachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. The tree is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
