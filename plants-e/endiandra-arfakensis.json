    "intro": "Endiandra arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak mountain ash, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the islands of Indonesia, particularly New Guinea and the Arfak Mountains. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
