    "intro": "Epidendrum mittelstaedtii, commonly known as the Mittelst\u00e4dt's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically features narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum mittelstaedtii is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
