It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant has aerial roots that allow it to cling to surfaces as it grows, making it well-suited for vertical gardens or hanging baskets. Its leaves can vary in size and shape depending on light conditions and environmental factors. Epipremnum pinnatum is relatively easy to care for, thriving in indirect sunlight and requiring moderate watering."
