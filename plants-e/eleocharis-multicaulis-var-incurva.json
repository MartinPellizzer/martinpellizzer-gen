    "intro": "Eleocharis multicaulis var. incurva, commonly known as the bent-stem spikegrass, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, curved stems and small, triangular leaves that are typically found in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems, and its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often arranged in dense clusters. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced curvature of the stem compared to the typical form of Eleocharis multicaulis."
