    "intro": "Eucalyptus vokesensis, commonly known as the Vokes' malleable, is a small to medium-sized eucalyptus tree native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from grey to white in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a distinctive aromatic scent. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, arranged in umbels, and attract a variety of native pollinators. The tree is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
