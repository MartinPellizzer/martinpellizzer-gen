    "intro": "Epidendrum carnosum, commonly known as the Fat Lip, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to grow in drier environments. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum carnosum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
