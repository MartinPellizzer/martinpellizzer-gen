    "intro": "Elymus triticoides var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
