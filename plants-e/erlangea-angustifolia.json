It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. Native to specific regions in South America, this plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
