    "intro": "Eulophia zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky substrates or in humus-rich soil. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination. Eulophia zollingeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
