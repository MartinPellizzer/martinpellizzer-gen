    "intro": "Euphorbia terracina f. retusa, commonly known as the curly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, waxy, and often curl inward, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
