    "intro": "Equilabium cinereum, commonly known as the gray bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
