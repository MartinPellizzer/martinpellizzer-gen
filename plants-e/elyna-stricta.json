    "intro": "Elyna stricta, commonly known as the rigid elyna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features slender, upright stems that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize transpiration in hot, dry environments. Elyna stricta is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic landscapes."
