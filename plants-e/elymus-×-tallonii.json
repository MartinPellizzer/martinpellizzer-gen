    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 tallonii, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass hybrid, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust growth habit, with tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, awned grains, typical of the Poaceae family. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-resistant and suitable for erosion control. Elymus \u00d7 tallonii is also valued for its forage quality and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
