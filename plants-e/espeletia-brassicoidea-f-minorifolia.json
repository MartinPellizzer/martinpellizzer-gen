    "intro": "Espeletia brassicoidea f. minorifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved heather plant, is a unique species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and dense foliage composed of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in the summer months. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in rocky or well-drained soils in cloud forests."
