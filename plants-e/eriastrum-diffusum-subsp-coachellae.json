    "intro": "Eriastrum diffusum subsp. coachellae, commonly known as the Coachella Valley eriastrum, is a low-growing, annual herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to hot, dry environments. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
