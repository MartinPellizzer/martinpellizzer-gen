It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and disturbed areas. Yukon wild rye plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
