    "intro": "Epidendrum trullatigeminiflorum, commonly known as the twin-flowered epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, and its flowers are arranged in a unique, twin-like pattern, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
