    "intro": "Encyclia ossenbachiana, commonly known as the Ossenbach's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, which is essential for surviving dry periods. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting dark center. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss in the wild."
