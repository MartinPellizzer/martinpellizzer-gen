    "intro": "Eurya reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, giving it a waxy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers followed by small, bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Eurya reflexa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
