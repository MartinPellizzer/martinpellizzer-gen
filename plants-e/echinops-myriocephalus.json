    "intro": "Echinops myriocephalus, commonly known as the Persian globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking spherical seed heads that resemble globes, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. It produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by the distinctive spiky seed heads that persist through the winter. Echinops myriocephalus is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
