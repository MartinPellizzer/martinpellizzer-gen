    "intro": "Echites tuberosus, commonly known as the tuberous echites, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, tuberous roots that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. Echites tuberosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
