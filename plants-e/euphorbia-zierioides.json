    "intro": "Euphorbia zierioides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in a layer of white, waxy hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stem. Euphorbia zierioides is well adapted to rocky, dry habitats and is often found in mountainous regions."
