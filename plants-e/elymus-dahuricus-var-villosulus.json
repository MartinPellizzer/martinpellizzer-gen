    "intro": "Elymus dahuricus var. villosulus, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fluffy appearance due to the presence of fine, silky hairs on its foliage. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle with spikelets that are often covered in short, soft hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
