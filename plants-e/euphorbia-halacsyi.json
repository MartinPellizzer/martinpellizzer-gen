    "intro": "Euphorbia halacsyi, commonly known as the Hungarian spurge, is a succulent plant native to Hungary and parts of Europe. It features a distinctive, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a characteristic common in many euphorbias for defense against herbivores. Euphorbia halacsyi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
