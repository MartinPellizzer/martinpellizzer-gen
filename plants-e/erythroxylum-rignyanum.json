It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
