    "intro": "Exocarpos pendulus, commonly known as the hanging wax apple, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, pendulous fruits resembling small apples. These fruits turn red when mature and contain several seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
