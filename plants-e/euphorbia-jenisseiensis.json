    "intro": "Euphorbia jenisseiensis, commonly known as the Jenisei spurge, is a succulent plant native to the cold regions of Siberia. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, and it has a low-growing habit. Euphorbia jenisseiensis is adapted to tolerate extreme cold and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
