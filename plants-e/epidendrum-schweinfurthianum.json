    "intro": "Epidendrum schweinfurthianum, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences bearing clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are strap-shaped, thick, and often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
