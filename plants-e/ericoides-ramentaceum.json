    "intro": "Ericoides ramentaceum, commonly known as the mossy heath, is a low-growing shrub belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Ericoides ramentaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
