    "intro": "Ebnerella longicoma, commonly known as the long-stemmed water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, sturdy petioles. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots system helps stabilize the sediment in freshwater ecosystems. Ebnerella longicoma plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms and is often found in still or slow-moving waters."
