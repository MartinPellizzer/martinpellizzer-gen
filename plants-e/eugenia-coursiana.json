    "intro": "Eugenia coursiana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or guavasteen, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe, with a sweet and tangy flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
