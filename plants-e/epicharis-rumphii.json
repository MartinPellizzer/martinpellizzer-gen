    "intro": "Epicharis rumphii, commonly known as the white spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thread-like petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are predominantly white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, intricate structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Epicharis rumphii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
