    "intro": "Eriogonum bloomeri, commonly known as the San Diego mountain buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to California. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum bloomeri plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
