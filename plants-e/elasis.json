It includes several species, such as Elasis oleifera, which is native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. They typically grow as small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, with smooth, often greyish bark. Elasis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their latex, which has industrial applications."
