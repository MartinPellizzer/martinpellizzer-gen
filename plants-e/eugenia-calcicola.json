    "intro": "Eugenia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Eugenia calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
