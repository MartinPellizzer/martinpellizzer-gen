    "intro": "Echinops tenerrimus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by the distinctive seed heads. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Echinops tenerrimus plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small animals."
