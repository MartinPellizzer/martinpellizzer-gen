It features a compact, branching structure with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
