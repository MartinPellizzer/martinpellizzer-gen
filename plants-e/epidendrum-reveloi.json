    "intro": "Epidendrum reveloi, commonly known as the showy epidendron, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are fleshy and store water, helping it survive in dry conditions. The flowers bloom in racemes and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
