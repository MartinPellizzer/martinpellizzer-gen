    "intro": "Elaphoglossum welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are usually protected by a membranous indusium. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species for cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
