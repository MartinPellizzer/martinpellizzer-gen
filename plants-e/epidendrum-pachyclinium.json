    "intro": "Epidendrum pachyclinium, commonly known as the Orchid of the Andes, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that produces multiple pseudobulbs, each topped by a single leaf. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, moist environments with good air circulation, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Its botanical characteristics make it both an ornamental and a subject of interest in orchid taxonomy."
