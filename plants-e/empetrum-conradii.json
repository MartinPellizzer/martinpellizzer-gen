    "intro": "Empetrum conradii, commonly known as the Greenland willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its woody stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. Empetrum conradii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various arctic wildlife species."
