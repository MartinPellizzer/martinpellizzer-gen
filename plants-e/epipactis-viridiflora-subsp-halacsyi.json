    "intro": "Epipactis viridiflora subsp. halacsyi, commonly known as the Hungarian green orchid, is a rare and protected orchid species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its germination and growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several countries."
