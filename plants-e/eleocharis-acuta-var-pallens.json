    "intro": "Eleocharis acuta var. pallens, commonly known as the pale spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually pale green or brown in color. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions and its role in stabilizing wetland soils. This species is also valued for its ecological importance in supporting aquatic insect populations and providing habitat for waterfowl."
