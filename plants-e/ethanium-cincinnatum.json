    "intro": "Ethanium cincinnatum, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
