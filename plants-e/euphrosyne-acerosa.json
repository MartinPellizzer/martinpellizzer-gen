    "intro": "Euphrosyne acerosa, commonly known as the hardy euphrosyne, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought resistance make it a hardy choice for landscaping. Euphrosyne acerosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
