    "intro": "Eugenia pyriformis, commonly known as the golden apple or pata de vaca, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, edible berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's ornamental value and fruit-bearing potential make it a popular choice for cultivation in warm climates."
