    "intro": "Epidorkis vagans, commonly known as the wandering leaf bladder, is a unique plant species belonging to the family Cystopteraceae. It is characterized by its small, rounded, and often inflated leaves that resemble bladders, which are used for water storage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Epidorkis vagans is a delicate and rare species, often found in specific microhabitats across temperate regions."
