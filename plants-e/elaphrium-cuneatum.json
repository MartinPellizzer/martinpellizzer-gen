It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Elaphrium cuneatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
