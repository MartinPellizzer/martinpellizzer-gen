    "intro": "Eleocharis maculosa f. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and pond margins. Its short stature and ability to thrive in saturated conditions contribute to its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. The varietal form 'depressa' distinguishes it from the typical form through its more compact growth habit and shorter stature."
