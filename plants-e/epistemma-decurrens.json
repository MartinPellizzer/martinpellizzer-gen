    "intro": "Epistemma decurrens, commonly known as the running episteme, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that can reach lengths of several meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Epistemma decurrens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
