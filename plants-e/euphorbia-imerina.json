    "intro": "Euphorbia imerina, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features succulent, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
