    "intro": "Euphrasia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf eyebright, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in clusters, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators. The species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties, particularly in treating eye conditions."
