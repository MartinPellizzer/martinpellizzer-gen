    "intro": "Enkianthus cernuus, commonly known as the drooping enkianthus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate flowers and graceful, drooping inflorescences."
