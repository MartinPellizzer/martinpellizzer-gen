    "intro": "Ervum longipedunculatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is often used in agricultural settings to enrich soil fertility."
