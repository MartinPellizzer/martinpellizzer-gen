    "intro": "Euonymus caucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian spindle, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by distinctive, red, berry-like fruits. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage, which turns a striking crimson or orange. Euonymus caucasicus is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
