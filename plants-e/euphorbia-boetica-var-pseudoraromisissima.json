    "intro": "Euphorbia boetica var. pseudoraromisissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in Mediterranean regions. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited to arid conditions."
