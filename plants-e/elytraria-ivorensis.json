    "intro": "Elytraria ivorensis, commonly known as the Ivorian grass, is a perennial grass species native to western Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock in its native region."
