    "intro": "Evonymopsis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed elderberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Berberidaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but typically consumed by birds rather than humans. Native to the mountainous regions of Central America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
