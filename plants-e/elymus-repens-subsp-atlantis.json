    "intro": "Elymus repens subsp. atlantis, commonly known as Atlantic grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to coastal and maritime environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
