    "intro": "Euphrasia pecorina, commonly known as the sheep's eye or the red-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically feature two red spots on the lower lip. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branching. Euphrasia pecorina is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties, though its use is limited due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements."
