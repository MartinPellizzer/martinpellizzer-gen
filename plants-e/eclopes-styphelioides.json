    "intro": "Eclopes styphelioides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false arum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a showy, often colorful spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
