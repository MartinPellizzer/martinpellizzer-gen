    "intro": "Echinocereus acifer subsp. acifer, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinct rib structure and spines that are often reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. The subspecies is characterized by its elongated spines and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
