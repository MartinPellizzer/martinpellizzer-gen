    "intro": "Euphorbia polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leafed spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which store water to help it survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant can grow up to 3 feet tall. Euphorbia polyphylla is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
