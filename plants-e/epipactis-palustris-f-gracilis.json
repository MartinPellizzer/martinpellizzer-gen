    "intro": "Epipactis palustris f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender marsh helleborine, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and swamps, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its reproductive strategy involves specialized pollination by certain insect species, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its continued existence."
