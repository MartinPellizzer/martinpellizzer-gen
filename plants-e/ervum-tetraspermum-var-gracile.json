    "intro": "Ervum tetraspermum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a climbing legume native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, twining stems with small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, elliptical pods containing four seeds, which is reflected in its scientific name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal use."
