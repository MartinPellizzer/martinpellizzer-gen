    "intro": "Euonymus japonicus f. viridivariegatus, commonly known as the Japanese spindlewood variegated form, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves with striking variegation of green and white or yellow, creating a decorative appearance. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are ornamental but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its attractive foliage. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is suitable for rock gardens, container planting, and as a border plant."
