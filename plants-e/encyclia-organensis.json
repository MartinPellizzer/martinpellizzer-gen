    "intro": "Encyclia organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southwestern United States.

The plant typically produces 3\u20135 lance-shaped leaves and has a single, erect stem with 3\u20136 elliptical flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
