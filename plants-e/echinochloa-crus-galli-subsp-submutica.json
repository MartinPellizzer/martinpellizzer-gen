    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli subsp. submutica, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and a tall, slender stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. This species is known for its aggressive growth and is considered a weed in many agricultural and turfgrass settings."
