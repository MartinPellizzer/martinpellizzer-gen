    "intro": "Enchylaena villosa, commonly known as the hairy senna, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Enchylaena villosa is often used in traditional medicine and has ornamental value in gardens."
