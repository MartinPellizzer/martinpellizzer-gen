    "intro": "Eucalyptus alba var. australasica, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces creamy-white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
