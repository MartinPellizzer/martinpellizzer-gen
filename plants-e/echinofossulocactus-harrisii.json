    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's echinofossulocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the apex of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
