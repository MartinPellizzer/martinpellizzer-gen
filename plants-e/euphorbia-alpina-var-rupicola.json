    "intro": "Euphorbia alpina var. rupicola, commonly known as the Alpine spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, showing adaptations to cold and arid conditions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant in cooler climates."
