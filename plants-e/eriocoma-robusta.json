It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eriocoma robusta is well adapted to poor, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
