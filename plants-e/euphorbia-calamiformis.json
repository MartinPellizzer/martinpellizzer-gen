    "intro": "Euphorbia calamiformis, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish tint. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia calamiformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
