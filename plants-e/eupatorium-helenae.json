    "intro": "Eupatorium helenae, commonly known as Helen's bones, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled spheres that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, slightly hairy texture. Eupatorium helenae thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas."
