    "intro": "Epidendrum serpens, commonly known as the snake orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that resemble a snake's body. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Epidendrum serpens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
