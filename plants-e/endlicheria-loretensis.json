It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
