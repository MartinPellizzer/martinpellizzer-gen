    "intro": "Euphorbia paludicola, commonly known as the swamp spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It has a shallow root system and thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Euphorbia paludicola is often found in coastal plain regions and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding."
