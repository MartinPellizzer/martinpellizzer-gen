    "intro": "Exodeconus integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually smooth and lack serrations, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. This plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
