    "intro": "Escobaria deserti, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the genus Escobaria, which includes several species of flowering plants adapted to harsh desert environments. The plant features a low-growing, cushion-like growth form with fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Escobaria deserti is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
