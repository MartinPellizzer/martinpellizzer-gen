    "intro": "Erythroxylum laurifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
