    "intro": "Euphorbia barrelieri var. thessala, commonly known as the Tossa euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, thick stem with a crown of fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and striking foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
