    "intro": "Eremophila pilosa, commonly known as the hairy emu bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Eremophila pilosa is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
