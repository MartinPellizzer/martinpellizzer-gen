    "intro": "Euphorbia benthamii, commonly known as the Benthams' spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem and leaves. Euphorbia benthamii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
