    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudonervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined spurge, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, greenish-yellow spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures containing small yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinct, veined appearance, giving it its common name. Euphorbia pseudonervosa is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem to survive in dry conditions."
