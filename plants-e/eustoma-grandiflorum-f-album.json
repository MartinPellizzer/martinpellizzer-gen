    "intro": "Eustoma grandiflorum f. album, commonly known as the white lisianthus, is a flowering plant characterized by its large, showy white petals. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, and the white coloration is due to the absence of pigments like anthocyanins. This variety is prized in horticulture for its elegant appearance and use in floral arrangements."
