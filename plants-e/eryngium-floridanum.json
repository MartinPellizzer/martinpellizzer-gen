    "intro": "Eryngium floridanum, commonly known as Florida thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features striking blue to purple spiny flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its composite flower heads and bract-like leaves."
