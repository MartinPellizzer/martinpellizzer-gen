    "intro": "Euphorbia mandoniana, commonly known as the Mandon's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a thick, stem-like structure with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain water in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized flower-like structures. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be present during the growing season. Euphorbia mandoniana is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
