    "intro": "Eltroplectris ortiziana, commonly known as the Ortiz's spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom during the wet season. Eltroplectris ortiziana typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
