It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rough, often hairy foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Eugenia asperifolia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and aromatic properties."
