    "intro": "Euphorbia villosa, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
