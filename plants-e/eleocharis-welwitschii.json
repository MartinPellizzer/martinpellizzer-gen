    "intro": "Eleocharis welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch bulrush, is a species of sedge native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and cylindrical flower spikes that appear in summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in aquatic environments."
