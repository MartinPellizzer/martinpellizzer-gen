    "intro": "Erysimum geisleri, commonly known as the Alpine Wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Erysimum geisleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
