    "intro": "Epaltes pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf epaltes, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Epaltes pygmaea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, shade-tolerant plant."
