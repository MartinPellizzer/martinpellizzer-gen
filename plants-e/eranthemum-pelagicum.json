    "intro": "Eranthemum pelagicum, commonly known as the sea eranthemum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. Eranthemum pelagicum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
