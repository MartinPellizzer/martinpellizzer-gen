    "intro": "Euphorbia filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
