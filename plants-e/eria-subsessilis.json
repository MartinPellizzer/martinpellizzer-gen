    "intro": "Eria subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Eria subsessilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
