    "intro": "Espinhassoa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, oily texture, making it highly valued for musical instruments and fine furniture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface with a slight serration along the edges. Espinhassoa is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, contributing to its rarity and ecological significance."
