    "intro": "Erica glandulosa subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. Erica glandulosa subsp. glandulosa is well-suited for coastal gardens and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
