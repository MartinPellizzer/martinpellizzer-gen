    "intro": "Encyclia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its flowers are relatively small, often less than an inch in diameter, and bloom during the warmer months. Encyclia pygmaea is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires careful watering to thrive."
