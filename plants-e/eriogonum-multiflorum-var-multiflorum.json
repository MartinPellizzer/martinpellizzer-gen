    "intro": "Eriogonum multiflorum var. multiflorum, commonly known as the Townsend's wild buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed sites. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
