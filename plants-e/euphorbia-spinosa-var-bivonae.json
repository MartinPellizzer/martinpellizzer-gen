    "intro": "Euphorbia spinosa var. bivonae, commonly known as the Bivona spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
