    "intro": "Erica exigua, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. Erica exigua typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
