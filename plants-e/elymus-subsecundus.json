    "intro": "Elymus subsecundus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Elymus subsecundus is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils, where it forms dense stands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
