    "intro": "Epiphyllum hookeri subsp. hookeri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fleshy, stem-like structures that grow horizontally and can reach lengths of up to several meters. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pink, and emit a strong fragrance. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
