    "intro": "Epidendrum cocleense, commonly known as the Christmas Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that bloom in a raceme, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Epidendrum cocleense is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
