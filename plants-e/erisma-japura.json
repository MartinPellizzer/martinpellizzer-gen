    "intro": "Erisma japura, commonly known as the Japurahua, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, adapted to the cooler mountain climates where it thrives. Erisma japura is often found in moist, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters."
