    "intro": "Epidendrum alieniferum, commonly known as the alien-bearing epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features strap-like leaves and produces striking, showy inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
