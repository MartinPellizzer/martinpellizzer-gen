    "intro": "Erythroxylum chiapense, commonly known as the Chiapanecan coca, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its botanical similarities to other coca species, it has been the subject of scientific study for its potential ecological and pharmacological significance."
