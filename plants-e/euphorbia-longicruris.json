    "intro": "Euphorbia longicruris, commonly known as the long-legged spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant features paired, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hair. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Euphorbia longicruris is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant."
