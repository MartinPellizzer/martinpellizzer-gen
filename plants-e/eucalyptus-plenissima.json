    "intro": "Eucalyptus plenissima, commonly known as the broad-leaved mallee, is a species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it is well adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Eucalyptus plenissima is a hardy shrub or tree that plays an important ecological role in its environment."
