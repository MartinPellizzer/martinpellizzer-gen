    "intro": "Ekebergia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf ironwood, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Ekebergia pumila is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important plant in local ecosystems."
