    "intro": "Euphorbia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss. Euphorbia stolonifera is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
