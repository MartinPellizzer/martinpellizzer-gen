    "intro": "Epidendrum pudicum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that resemble a slipper, which are typically arranged in a spike. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Epidendrum pudicum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display and relatively easy care requirements."
