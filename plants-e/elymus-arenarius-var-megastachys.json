    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. megastachys, commonly known as the sandbar wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces spikelets that are often larger than those of the typical Elymus arenarius, giving it its specific epithet \"megastachys.\" Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the inflorescence is a loose panicle with ascending branches. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
