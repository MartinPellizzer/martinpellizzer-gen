It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in grassland ecosystems. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or pale blue, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. Elleanthus harlingii is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in its native habitat."
