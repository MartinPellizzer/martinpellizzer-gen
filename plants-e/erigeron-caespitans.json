    "intro": "Erigeron caespitans, commonly known as blueweed or blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and blue to purple flower heads that bloom from late summer into early fall. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are composed of ray florets that give the appearance of a daisy, while the central disk florets are yellow. Erigeron caespitans is often found in moist meadows, prairies, and along stream banks, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
