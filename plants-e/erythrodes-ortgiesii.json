    "intro": "Erythrodes ortgiesii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss. Erythrodes ortgiesii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
