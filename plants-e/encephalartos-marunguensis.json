    "intro": "Encephalartos marunguensis, commonly known as the Marungwenzi cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
