    "intro": "Euphorbia abyssinica var. tetragona, commonly known as the Abyssinian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
