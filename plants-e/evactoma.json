    "intro": "Evactoma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Evactoma is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it a common weed in many regions."
