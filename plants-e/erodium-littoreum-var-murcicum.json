    "intro": "Erodium littoreum var. murcicum, commonly known as sea lentil, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed coastal habitats. Its small, lens-shaped seeds are an important food source for various bird species. The plant's ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds makes it well adapted to harsh maritime environments."
