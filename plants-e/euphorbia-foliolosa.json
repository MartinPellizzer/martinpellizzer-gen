    "intro": "Euphorbia foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
