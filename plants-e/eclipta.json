    "intro": "Eclipta, commonly known as false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, yellow flowers that are arranged in composite heads, resembling dandelion flowers. Eclipta species are often found in disturbed soils and are sometimes considered weeds due to their rapid growth and adaptability."
