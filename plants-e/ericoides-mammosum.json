    "intro": "Ericoides mammosum, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is adapted to prevent soil erosion and stabilize rocky terrain. Ericoides mammosum is often found in alpine meadows and is well-suited to cold, dry climates."
