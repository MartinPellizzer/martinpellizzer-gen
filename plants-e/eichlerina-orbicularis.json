    "intro": "Eichlerina orbicularis, commonly known as the globe senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its orbicular, or nearly round, leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats. Eichlerina orbicularis is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
