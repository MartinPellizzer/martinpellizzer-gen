    "intro": "Eucalyptus stellulata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in summer. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
