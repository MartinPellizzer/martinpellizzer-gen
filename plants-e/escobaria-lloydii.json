It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Escobaria lloydii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
