    "intro": "Elytrigia mediterranea, commonly known as Mediterranean needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Elytrigia mediterranea plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native environment."
