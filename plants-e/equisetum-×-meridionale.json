    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 meridionale, commonly known as the northern horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem covered with small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and resilient species in its habitat. The plant is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and its unique morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptations to wet environments."
