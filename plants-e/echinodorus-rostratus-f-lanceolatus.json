    "intro": "Echinodorus rostratus f. lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It features long, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water surface, adding ornamental value to aquatic gardens. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with moderate to high light conditions. This variety is popular in aquariums and ponds due to its hardy nature and ability to provide oxygen and shelter for aquatic life."
