    "intro": "Eulophia sankisiensis, commonly known as the Sankisi orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Eulophia sankisiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
