    "intro": "Elaphoglossum peltatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum peltatum is often found in rocky soils and forest floors, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in temperate regions."
