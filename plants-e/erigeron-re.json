    "intro": "Erigeron re, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open fields and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erigeron re is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
