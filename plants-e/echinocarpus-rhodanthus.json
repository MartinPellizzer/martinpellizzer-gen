    "intro": "Echinocarpus rhodanthus, commonly known as the red-berried burr, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruits that encase the seeds. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture. The fruit's spines serve as a defense mechanism and aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing."
