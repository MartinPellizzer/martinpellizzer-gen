    "intro": "Euphorbia decaryi var. ampanihyensis, commonly known as the Ampanihy euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are specialized flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and nutrient-poor soils. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
