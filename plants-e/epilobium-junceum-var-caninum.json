It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in the summer months. The species is known for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
