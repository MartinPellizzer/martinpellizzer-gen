    "intro": "Epidendrum sigsigense, commonly known as the Sigsig orchid, is a species native to the humid cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, branching structure with numerous pseudobulbs and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and are characterized by their vibrant colors, often in shades of pink and white. Epidendrum sigsigense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
