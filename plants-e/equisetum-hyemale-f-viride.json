    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale f. viride, commonly known as green horsehair grass, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, green stems that lack leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, typical of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
