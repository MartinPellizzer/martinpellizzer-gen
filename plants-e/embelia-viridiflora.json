    "intro": "Embelia viridiflora, commonly known as green-flowered embelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, black seeds. Embelia viridiflora is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is valued for its aromatic properties in traditional medicine."
