    "intro": "Eucalyptus pterocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped, grey-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by woody, barrel-shaped fruits. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Eucalyptus pterocarpa is a hardy species that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
