    "intro": "Epidendrum glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky leaved orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, often sticky leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Epidendrum glutinosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
