    "intro": "Euphorbia clementei var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive stem that is often swollen and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The leaves are narrow and pointed, typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its latex-producing properties. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
