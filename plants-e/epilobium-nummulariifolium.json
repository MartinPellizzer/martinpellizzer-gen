    "intro": "Epilobium nummulariifolium, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
