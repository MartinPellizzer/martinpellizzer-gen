    "intro": "Ebenoxylum, commonly known as the silky willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Salicaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in catkins. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a silvery or grayish underside, giving the plant its common name. Ebenoxylum species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often found in wet or moist habitats such as stream banks and marshes."
