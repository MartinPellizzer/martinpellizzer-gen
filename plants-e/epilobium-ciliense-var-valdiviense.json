    "intro": "Epilobium ciliense var. valdiviense, commonly known as the Valdivian willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly in the temperate rainforests of Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along riverbanks and in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
