    "intro": "Euphorbia ensifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, woody stem with thick, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem. Euphorbia ensifolia is toxic, containing milky sap that can cause skin irritation."
