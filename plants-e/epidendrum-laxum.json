It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. Its growth habit is typically terrestrial or epiphytic, depending on environmental conditions. Epidendrum laxum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
