    "intro": "Euphrasia kerneri, commonly known as the Kern\u2019s eyebright, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while the flowers have five petals and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Euphrasia kerneri is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though it is not widely cultivated."
