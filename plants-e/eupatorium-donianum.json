    "intro": "Eupatorium donianum, commonly known as white boneset, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. White boneset is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
