    "intro": "Epipactis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a tall stem that bears a spike of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and thrives in rich, loamy soils. Its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and moths, and it produces small, dark brown seeds in a capsule. Epipactis longifolia is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
