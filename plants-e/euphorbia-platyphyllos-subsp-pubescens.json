    "intro": "Euphorbia platyphyllos subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, stocky stem covered in dense, soft, pubescent hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique texture and drought tolerance."
