    "intro": "Eugenia echinulata, commonly known as the velvetwood or black mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and dense, glossy foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries. Eugenia echinulata thrives in saline and waterlogged soils, often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its unique adaptations make it an important species for coastal vegetation and biodiversity."
