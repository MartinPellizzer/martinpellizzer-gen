    "intro": "Erianthus formosanus, commonly known as the Formosa grass, is a perennial grass native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
