    "intro": "Ecbolium incanum, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
