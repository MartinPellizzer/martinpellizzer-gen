    "intro": "Euphorbia vaccaria var. vaccaria, commonly known as the petty spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy, greenish-yellow stems that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Euphorbia vaccaria var. vaccaria is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
