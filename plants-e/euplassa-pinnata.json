    "intro": "Euplassa pinnata, commonly known as the winged maple-leaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive pinnately compound leaves, which have a feathery appearance and often exhibit a striking contrast between the upper and lower surfaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Euplassa pinnata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
