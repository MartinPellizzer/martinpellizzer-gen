    "intro": "Eriophorum scabridum, commonly known as the rough cottongrass, is a low-growing plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the tips of its slender stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, scaly hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates. Eriophorum scabridum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment."
