    "intro": "Eruca sativa var. stenocarpa, commonly known as narrow-fruited garden cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a slender, elongated siliqua that remains closed until maturity, distinguishing it from other Eruca varieties. This plant is valued for its peppery flavor and is often used in salads or as a seasoning in various cuisines."
