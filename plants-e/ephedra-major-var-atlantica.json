    "intro": "Ephedra major var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. It produces small, woody capsules that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity."
