It features showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small cups, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and conservation landscapes."
