    "intro": "Erodium foetidum, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces small, round, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
