    "intro": "Eremopyrum bonaepartis f. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy eremopyrum, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy landscapes."
