    "intro": "Ebenopsis, commonly known as the Florida maple or red maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, though it is not a true palm. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. Ebenopsis produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed encased in a hard, woody shell."
