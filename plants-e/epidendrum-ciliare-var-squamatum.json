    "intro": "Epidendrum ciliare var. squamatum, commonly known as the Squamate Whisker Epidendrum, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage, featuring hairy or scaly textures, adds to its ornamental appeal. It is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its resilience and aesthetic value."
