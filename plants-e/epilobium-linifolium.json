    "intro": "Epilobium linifolium, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. It produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
