    "intro": "Erysimum rupestre, commonly known as rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustards, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erysimum rupestre is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
