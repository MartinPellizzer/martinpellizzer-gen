    "intro": "Echioides palustris, commonly known as the marsh hound or swamp hound, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its small, white or greenish flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. Echioides palustris plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
