    "intro": "Eperua grandiflora subsp. guyanensis, commonly known as the Guyana eperua, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Guyana and parts of Venezuela. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The tree has a straight trunk and can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a dense canopy that provides shade. Its leaves are compound, with long, slender leaflets, and it produces heavy, woody fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
