    "intro": "Emmenanthe scopulina, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Emmenanthe scopulina is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for environmental health."
