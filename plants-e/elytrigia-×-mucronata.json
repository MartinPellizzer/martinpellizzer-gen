    "intro": "Elytrigia \u00d7 mucronata, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid between Elytrigia repens and Elytrigia bulbosa, characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
