    "intro": "Euphorbia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fine hairs, which covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Due to its low water requirements, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
