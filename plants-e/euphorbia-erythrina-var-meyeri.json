It features distinctive, spiny stems and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by fleshy, red bracts. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
