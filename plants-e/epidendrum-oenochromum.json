It is characterized by its striking appearance, featuring dark green leaves with red or purple tips and clusters of fragrant, violet or pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
