    "intro": "Euphorbia polycarpa var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a distinctive hairy texture on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
