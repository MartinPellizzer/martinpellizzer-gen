    "intro": "Eucalyptus xanthoclada, commonly known as the yellow box, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that displays a yellowish hue, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically glossy green with a slightly hairy underside. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and forests."
