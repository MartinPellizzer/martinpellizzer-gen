    "intro": "Epidendrum macdougallii, commonly known as the Macdougall's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically features strap-like leaves that are dark green and somewhat fleshy, adapted to store moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum macdougallii is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
