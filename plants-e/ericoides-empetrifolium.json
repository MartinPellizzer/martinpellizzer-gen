    "intro": "Ericoides empetrifolium, commonly known as the bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically red or dark green, and it produces bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to many animals. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of four pink or white petals, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and small mammals. Ericoides empetrifolium is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in horticulture for ornamental purposes."
