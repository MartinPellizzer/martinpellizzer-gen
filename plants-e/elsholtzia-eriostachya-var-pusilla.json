The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, aromatic, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive silvery appearance. This variety is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
