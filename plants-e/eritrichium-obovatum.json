It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and ovate, with a hairy texture, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Eritrichium obovatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
