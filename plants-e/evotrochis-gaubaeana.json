It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions of Africa. The plant has scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along the branches, giving it a dense, compact appearance. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments due to its drought-resistant adaptations."
