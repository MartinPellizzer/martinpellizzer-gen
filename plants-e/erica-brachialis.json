    "intro": "Erica brachialis, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants. The plant features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Erica brachialis is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
