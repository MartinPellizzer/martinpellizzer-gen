It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. Elytrigia kasteki is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
