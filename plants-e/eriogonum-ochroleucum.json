    "intro": "Eriogonum ochroleucum, commonly known as the whiteleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Eriogonum ochroleucum is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
