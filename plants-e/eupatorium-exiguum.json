    "intro": "Eupatorium exiguum, commonly known as rough skeletonleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and along streambanks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, white to pale blue flowers appear in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. Eupatorium exiguum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
