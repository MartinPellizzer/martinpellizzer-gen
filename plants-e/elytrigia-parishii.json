    "intro": "Elytrigia parishii, commonly known as the Parry's brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal spikelet that bears small, two-lobed bracts. Elytrigia parishii is valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
