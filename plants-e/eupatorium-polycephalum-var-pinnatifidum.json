    "intro": "Eupatorium polycephalum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in dense, spherical clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and finely toothed, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
