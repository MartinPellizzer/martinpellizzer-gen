    "intro": "Erucastrum repandum subsp. saxatile, commonly known as the saxatile bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it well-suited to harsh environments. The subspecies is often found in gravelly soils and is considered a characteristic species of dry, open habitats."
