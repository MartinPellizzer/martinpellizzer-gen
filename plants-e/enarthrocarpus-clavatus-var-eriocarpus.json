    "intro": "Enarthrocarpus clavatus var. eriocarpus, commonly known as the silky sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by flat, woody pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
