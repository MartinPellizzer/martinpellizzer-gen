    "intro": "Exallage buruensis, commonly known as the Buru sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Buru in Indonesia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued for its unique scent and durability. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Exallage buruensis is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
