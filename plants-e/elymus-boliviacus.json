    "intro": "Elymus boliviacus, commonly known as Bolivian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Argentina. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Elymus boliviacus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
