    "intro": "Euphorbia polygona var. noorsveldensis, commonly known as the Noorsveld euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually spiny or reduced, contributing to its defense against herbivores. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
