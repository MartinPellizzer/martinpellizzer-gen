    "intro": "Erythroxylum subsessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaved erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces elliptical, red berries that are typically harvested for their psychoactive properties. Due to its association with the cultivation of coca, it is often considered a close relative of the coca plant."
