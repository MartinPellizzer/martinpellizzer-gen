    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. boreale, commonly known as northern field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many ancient plant species. Its presence often indicates a habitat with high mineral content and good drainage."
