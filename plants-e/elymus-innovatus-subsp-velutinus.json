    "intro": "Elymus innovatus subsp. velutinus, commonly known as velvet foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky hairs that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in groups, with the lemma and palea bearing short, soft hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Velvet foxtail is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize areas quickly, making it both a weed and a valuable forage plant."
