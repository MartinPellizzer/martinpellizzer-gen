    "intro": "Equilabium masukense var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected flame flower, is a unique variant of the Equilabium masukense species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its striking, fiery red bracts that resemble flames, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. The leaves are deeply lobed and dissected, giving the plant a feathery appearance that enhances its visual appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. While it is not widely cultivated, its ornamental value has led to increasing interest among plant enthusiasts."
