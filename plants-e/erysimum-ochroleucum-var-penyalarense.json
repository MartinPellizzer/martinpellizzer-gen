It is a herbaceous perennial with bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, moist climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
