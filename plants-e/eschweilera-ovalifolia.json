    "intro": "Eschweilera ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf zygocactus, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
