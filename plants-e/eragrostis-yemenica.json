    "intro": "Eragrostis yemenica, commonly known as Yemen grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for dryland agriculture. Eragrostis yemenica is often used as forage for livestock and has potential for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
