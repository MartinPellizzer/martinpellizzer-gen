    "intro": "Equisetum funstonii var. nudum, commonly known as the naked horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that lack leaves, with only whorls of small, scale-like structures at the nodes. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. This variety is distinguished by its reduced foliage compared to other horsetail species."
