    "intro": "Enkleia siamensis subsp. andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman rock orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Andaman Islands. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit and typically produces a single, slender stem. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
