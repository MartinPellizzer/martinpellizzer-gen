    "intro": "Eriogonum deflexum subsp. rixfordii, commonly known as the Rixford\u2019s buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
