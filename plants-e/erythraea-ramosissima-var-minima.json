    "intro": "Erythraea ramosissima var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf erythraea, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
