    "intro": "Englerastrum scandens, commonly known as the climbing dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems that often climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the dandelion, followed by elongated, bristly seed capsules. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a rough texture, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Englerastrum scandens is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively through its stems."
