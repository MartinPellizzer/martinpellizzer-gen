    "intro": "Eurybia macrophylla, commonly known as the showy golden aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features upright, branching stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, composite flower heads in late summer to early fall, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white to pale purple ray florets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Eurybia macrophylla is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
