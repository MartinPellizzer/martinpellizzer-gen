    "intro": "Eugenia molokaiana, commonly known as the Moloka\u02bbi hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Moloka\u02bbi. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
