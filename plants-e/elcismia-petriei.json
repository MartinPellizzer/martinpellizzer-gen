    "intro": "Elcismia petriei, commonly known as the Hawaiian ghostflower, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Elcismia petriei is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
