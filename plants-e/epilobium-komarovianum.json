    "intro": "Epilobium komarovianum, commonly known as Komarov's willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, exhibiting a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Epilobium komarovianum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
