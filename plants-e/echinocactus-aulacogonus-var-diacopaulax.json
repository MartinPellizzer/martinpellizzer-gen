    "intro": "Echinocactus aulacogonus var. diacopaulax, commonly known as the blue ghost cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant features dense, blue-gray spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the top of the stem during the spring. This cactus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
