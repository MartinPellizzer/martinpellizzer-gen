    "intro": "Eucalyptus formanii subsp. circulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to dry conditions and has a deep root system to access groundwater. This subspecies is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
