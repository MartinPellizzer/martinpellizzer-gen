    "intro": "Erica ignescens, commonly known as the fire heath, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a drought-resistant feature. Erica ignescens is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its tolerance of harsh environmental conditions."
