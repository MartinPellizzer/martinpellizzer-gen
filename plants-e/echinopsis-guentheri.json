    "intro": "Echinopsis guentheri, commonly known as the Guenther's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
