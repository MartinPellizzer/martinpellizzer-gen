    "intro": "Elaphoglossum backhouseanum, commonly known as the Backhouse's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a generally upright growth habit. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, spore-producing structures called sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species for botanical gardens and collections."
