    "intro": "Eria myosurus, commonly known as the mouse-ear orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Eria myosurus is relatively rare and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
