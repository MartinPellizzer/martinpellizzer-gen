    "intro": "Echinochloa erecta, commonly known as rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 3 to 5 millimeters long, with bracts that are often longer than the flowers themselves. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Echinochloa erecta is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland or riparian habitats."
