    "intro": "Epilobium hookerianum, commonly known as Hooker's willowherb, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, rocky habitats. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine environment. Epilobium hookerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
