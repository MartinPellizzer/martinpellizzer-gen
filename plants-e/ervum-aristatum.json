    "intro": "Ervum aristatum, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It has a climbing habit, often using its tendrils to support itself on other vegetation or structures. Ervum aristatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitats."
