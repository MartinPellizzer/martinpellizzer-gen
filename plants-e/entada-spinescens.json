It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, woody trunk that often forms a honeycomb-like pattern on its surface. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are compound, with multiple leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
