    "intro": "Eragrostis tubiformis, commonly known as the tubular grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, tubular flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Eragrostis tubiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
