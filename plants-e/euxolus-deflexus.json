    "intro": "Euxolus deflexus, commonly known as the flexible euphorbia, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It features succulent, fleshy stems that are often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are usually alternate and may be lance-shaped or ovate, depending on the growth conditions. Euxolus deflexus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
