    "intro": "Exochaenium gracile, commonly known as slender marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively across moist soils. Exochaenium gracile is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
