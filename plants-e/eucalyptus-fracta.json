    "intro": "Eucalyptus fracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its bark is usually smooth and peels in thin strips, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus fracta is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat for various native wildlife species."
