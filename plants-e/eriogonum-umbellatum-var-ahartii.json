    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. ahartii, commonly known as Ahart's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ahart's buckwheat is an important nectar source for pollinators and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid regions."
