    "intro": "Elaphoglossum crispatum var. beitelii, commonly known as the Beitel's hairy shield fern, is a variant of the hairy shield fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that are often covered in soft, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
