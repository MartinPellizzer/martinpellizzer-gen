    "intro": "Euphorbia tuberculatoides, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, cylindrical stems covered in small, tuberculate bumps, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. The plant contains milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin and should be handled with care."
