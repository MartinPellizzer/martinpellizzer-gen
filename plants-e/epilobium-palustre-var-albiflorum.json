    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and North America. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow from the base and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, adapted to thrive in moist environments. This variant is distinguished by its notably white flowers, contrasting with the more typical pink or red flowers of the main species."
