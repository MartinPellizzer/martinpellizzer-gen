It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are usually opposite, with serrated edges, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic scent. Eupatorium dombeyanum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
