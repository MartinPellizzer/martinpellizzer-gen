    "intro": "Eucalyptus haemastoma var. montana, commonly known as the mountain ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, grey, and green, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. It produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open forests and heathlands."
