    "intro": "Euphorbia pitcairnensis, commonly known as the Pitcairn euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the remote Pitcairn Islands in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
