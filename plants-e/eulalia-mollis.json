    "intro": "Eulalia mollis, commonly known as the silver flax or silver grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-blue foliage and delicate, feathery plumes that sway gracefully in the wind. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscapes. Eulalia mollis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
