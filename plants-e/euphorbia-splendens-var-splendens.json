    "intro": "Euphorbia splendens var. splendens, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often red or purple in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by unique, lantern-like seed pods. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
