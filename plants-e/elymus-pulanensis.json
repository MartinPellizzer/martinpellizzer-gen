    "intro": "Elymus pulanensis, commonly known as the Pulan wild rye, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Elymus pulanensis is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, indicating its tolerance for marginal environments. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
