It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear panicles of small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced during the growing season. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of wetlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
