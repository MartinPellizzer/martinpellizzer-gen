    "intro": "Eragrostis rubiginosa, commonly known as red\u9896 grass, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, reddish-brown leaves that often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a resilient and adaptable species."
