It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, and are usually pink or reddish in color. Epilobium nesophilum is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
