    "intro": "Ericoides vagans, commonly known as the wandering ericoid, is a rare and elusive plant species found in specific alpine and subalpine habitats. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ericoides vagans is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
