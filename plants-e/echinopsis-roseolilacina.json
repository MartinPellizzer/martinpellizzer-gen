    "intro": "Echinopsis roseolilacina, commonly known as the Pink Pincushion Cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical shape, often covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces showy, pinkish-lavender flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Echinopsis roseolilacina is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
