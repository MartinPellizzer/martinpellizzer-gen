    "intro": "Erica hispidula var. micrantha, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal gardens."
