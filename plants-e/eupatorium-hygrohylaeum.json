It features showy, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its common name reflects its preference for humid environments and its historical use in traditional medicine."
