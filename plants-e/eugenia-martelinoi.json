It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe, with a sweet and aromatic flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species within the Eugenia genus."
