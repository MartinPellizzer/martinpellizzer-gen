    "intro": "Eragrostis spinosa, commonly known as the spiny lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry foliage with sharp, spiny margins. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet that bears small, two-lobed florets. Eragrostis spinosa is drought-tolerant and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
