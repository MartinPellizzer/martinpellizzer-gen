    "intro": "Erigeron blakei, commonly known as the Mexican fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its showy white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Erigeron blakei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
