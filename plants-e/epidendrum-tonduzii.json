    "intro": "Epidendrum tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduzii Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid conditions. Epidendrum tonduzii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
