    "intro": "Eriophyllum watsonii, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eriophyllum watsonii is also valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
