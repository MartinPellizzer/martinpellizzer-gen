    "intro": "Erica perspicua var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved heath, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are broader than the typical variety. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
