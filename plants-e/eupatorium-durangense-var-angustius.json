    "intro": "Eupatorium durangense var. angustius, commonly known as narrowleaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Durango, Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and finely divided, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
