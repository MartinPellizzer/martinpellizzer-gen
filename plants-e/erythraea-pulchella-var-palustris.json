    "intro": "Erythraea pulchella var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh erythraea, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
