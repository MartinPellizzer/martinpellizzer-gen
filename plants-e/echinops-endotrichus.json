    "intro": "Echinops endotrichus, commonly known as the soft thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that become prominent in late summer and autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, woolly bracts. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats. Echinops endotrichus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
