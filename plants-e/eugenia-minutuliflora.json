    "intro": "Eugenia minutuliflora, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, round, red berries that are edible but often used in local traditional medicine. Eugenia minutuliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and aromatic properties."
