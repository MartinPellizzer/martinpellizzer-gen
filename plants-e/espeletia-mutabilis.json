It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Its flowers exhibit a unique color change, shifting from white to pink or red as they mature. This species is notable for its adaptations to harsh, cold climates and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
