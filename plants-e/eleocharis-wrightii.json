    "intro": "Eleocharis wrightii, commonly known as Wright's spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually green or brown in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Eleocharis wrightii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated conditions."
