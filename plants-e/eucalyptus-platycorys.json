    "intro": "Eucalyptus platycorys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Western Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub form. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are arranged in clusters, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Eucalyptus platycorys is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions."
