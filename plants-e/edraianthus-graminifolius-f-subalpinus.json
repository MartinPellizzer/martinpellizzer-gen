    "intro": "Edraianthus graminifolius f. subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine grass-leaved edraianthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and vibrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its growth form and flowering period make it a distinctive feature of alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
