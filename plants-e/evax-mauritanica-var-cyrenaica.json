    "intro": "Evax mauritanica var. cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica evax, is a succulent plant native to North Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
