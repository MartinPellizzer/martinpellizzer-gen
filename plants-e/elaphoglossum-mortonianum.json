    "intro": "Elaphoglossum mortonianum, commonly known as the Mortonian holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
