    "intro": "Embryopteris loureiroana, commonly known as the Loureiro's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged substrates. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
