    "intro": "Encephalartos horridus var. trispinosus, commonly known as the three-spined cycad, is a rare and distinctive member of the Zamiaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a dense rosette of thick, leathery leaves that are adorned with prominent spines. Its foliage is typically a deep green, and it produces a tall, slender cone that bears both male and female flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
