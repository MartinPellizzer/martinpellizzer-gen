    "intro": "Epilobium neriophyllum subsp. cylindrostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and other damp habitats. The plant has slender, ascending stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow and lanceolate. Its flowers are pink to reddish, arranged in dense clusters, and are pollinated primarily by insects. This subspecies is characterized by its cylindrical stigma, which distinguishes it from other members of the Epilobium genus."
