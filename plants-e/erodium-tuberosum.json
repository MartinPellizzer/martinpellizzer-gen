    "intro": "Erodium tuberosum, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
