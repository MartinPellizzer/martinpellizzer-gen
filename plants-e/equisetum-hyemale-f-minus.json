    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale f. minus, commonly known as the dwarf scouring rush, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its reduced size compared to the typical species. The plant features whorled leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
