    "intro": "Eria ania, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flower spike that resembles a ghostly silhouette. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate, delicate petals that bloom in the shade of the forest canopy. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Eria ania is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
