    "intro": "Epidendrum minutum, commonly known as the miniature epidendron, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Epidendrum minutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
