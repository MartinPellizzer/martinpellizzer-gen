    "intro": "Euphorbia magnifica, commonly known as the magnificent spurge, is a striking succulent native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Euphorbia magnifica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens."
