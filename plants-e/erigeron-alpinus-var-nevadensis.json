    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
