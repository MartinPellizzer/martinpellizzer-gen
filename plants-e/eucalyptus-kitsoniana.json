    "intro": "Eucalyptus kitsoniana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, inland environments. Eucalyptus kitsoniana is valued for its aromatic oils and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
