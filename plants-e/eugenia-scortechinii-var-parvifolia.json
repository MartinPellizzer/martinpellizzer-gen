    "intro": "Eugenia scortechinii var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf wax apple, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to red when mature. The fruits are edible, though typically used in local cuisines rather than commercially. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade."
