    "intro": "Euphorbia texana, commonly known as Texas spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, glandular-studded stems and leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Euphorbia texana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
