    "intro": "Echinops kermanensis, commonly known as the Persian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran and Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a sea urchin, giving it its scientific name. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Echinops kermanensis is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots and gray-green foliage to reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
