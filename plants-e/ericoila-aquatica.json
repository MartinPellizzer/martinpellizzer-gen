    "intro": "Ericoila aquatica, commonly known as the water heather, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a compact, shrub-like form with small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming from spring to early summer. Ericoila aquatica is well adapted to aquatic environments, with its roots capable of tolerating waterlogged conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and small vertebrates."
