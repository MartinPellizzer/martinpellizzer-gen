    "intro": "Epidendrum longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Epidendrum longiflorum is often grown as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
