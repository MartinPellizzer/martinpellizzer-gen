    "intro": "Elaphoglossum dumrongii, commonly known as the Thai holly fern, is a rare and endangered species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the leaves. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
