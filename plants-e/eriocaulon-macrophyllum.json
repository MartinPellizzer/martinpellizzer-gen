    "intro": "Eriocaulon macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf threadgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in wetland and marshy environments. Its leaves are broad and elongated, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Eriocaulon macrophyllum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
