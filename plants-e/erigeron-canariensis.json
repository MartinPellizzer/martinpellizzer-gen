It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Erigeron canariensis is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
