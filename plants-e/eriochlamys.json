    "intro": "Eriochlamys, commonly known as the false sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Eriochlamys species often grow in prairies, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Their seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to their ability to colonize open areas."
