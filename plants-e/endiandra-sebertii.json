    "intro": "Endiandra sebertii, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has compound leaves with elliptical leaflets. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
