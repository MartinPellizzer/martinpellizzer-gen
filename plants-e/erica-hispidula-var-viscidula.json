    "intro": "Erica hispidula var. viscidula, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming primarily during the spring and summer months. The plant has wiry, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This species is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
