    "intro": "Euphorbia anacantha, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched, spiny stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Euphorbia anacantha is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
