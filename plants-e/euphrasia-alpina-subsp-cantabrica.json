    "intro": "Euphrasia alpina subsp. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers with prominent dark veins. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
