    "intro": "Ebertia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ebertia is native to the Americas and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural fields."
