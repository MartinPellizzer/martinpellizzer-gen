    "intro": "Echium vulgare var. argentae, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces striking spikes of violet-blue flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Silverweed is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
