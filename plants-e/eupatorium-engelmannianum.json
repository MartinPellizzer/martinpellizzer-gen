    "intro": "Eupatorium engelmannianum, commonly known as Engelmann's boneset, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy areas, and it is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
