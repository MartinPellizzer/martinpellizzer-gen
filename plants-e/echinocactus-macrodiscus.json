    "intro": "Echinocactus macrodiscus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on long, slender stems. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Echinocactus macrodiscus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
