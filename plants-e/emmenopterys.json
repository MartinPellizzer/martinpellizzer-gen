It consists of several species, most notably Emmenopterys wilsonii, which is native to China and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, with its foliage displaying vibrant colors ranging from deep green to red and purple. Emmenopterys is typically evergreen, with a slow growth rate, making it suitable for indoor or shaded outdoor environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark purple berries, which are an important food source for certain bird species."
