    "intro": "Excoecaria densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by bright orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
