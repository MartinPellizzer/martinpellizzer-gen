    "intro": "Exogonium luteum, commonly known as the yellow exogonium, is a unique plant species characterized by its striking yellow foliage. It belongs to the family Araceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with broad, waxy leaves that have a distinct yellow-green coloration. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spathe, a common feature in the Araceae family. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant, though it requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive."
