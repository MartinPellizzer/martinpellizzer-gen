    "intro": "Exallage congesta, commonly known as the clustered spike moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are borne on short, upright stalks. Exallage congesta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
