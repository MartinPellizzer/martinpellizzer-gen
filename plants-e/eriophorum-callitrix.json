    "intro": "Eriophorum callitrix, commonly known as the slender cotton-grass, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, white tufts of silky hairs that resemble cotton, which are produced by the flowering heads. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra and mountainous areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Eriophorum callitrix plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic invertebrates."
