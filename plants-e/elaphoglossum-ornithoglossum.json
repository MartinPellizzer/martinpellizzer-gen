    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ornithoglossum, commonly known as the bird's tongue fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble a bird's tongue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Elaphoglossum ornithoglossum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
