    "intro": "Epilobium nummulariifolium var. minimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, round to oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and wet meadows. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a ground cover."
