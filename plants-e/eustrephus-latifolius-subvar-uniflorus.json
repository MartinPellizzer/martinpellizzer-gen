It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces solitary, showy flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in moist, well-drained soils. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
