    "intro": "Eremophila kraenzlinii, commonly known as the pink fairy fan, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in heathlands and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun. Eremophila kraenzlinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
