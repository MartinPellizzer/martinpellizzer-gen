    "intro": "Ebermaiera nelsonioides, commonly known as the Nelson's evergreen, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark, spherical berries. Ebermaiera nelsonioides is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, making it a characteristic component of the understorey vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
