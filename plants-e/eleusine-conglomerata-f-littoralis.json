    "intro": "Eleusine conglomerata f. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal lovegrass, is a variant of the common lovegrass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in saline or coastal environments, showing a high tolerance for salt and wind exposure. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and withstand harsh maritime conditions."
