The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Epidendrum tridens is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
