    "intro": "Euphorbia viduiflora, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
