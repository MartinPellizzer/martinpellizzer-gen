    "intro": "Eriocaulon nigrum var. fuscescens, commonly known as black spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of marsh and swamp ecosystems. The variety fuscescens is distinguished by its darker coloration and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Eriocaulon nigrum."
