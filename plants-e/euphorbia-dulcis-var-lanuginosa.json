    "intro": "Euphorbia dulcis var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a succulent plant characterized by its fuzzy, woolly texture on its stems and leaves. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
