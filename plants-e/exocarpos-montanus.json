    "intro": "Exocarpos montanus, commonly known as mountain waxapple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is native to the eastern coast of Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and rocky areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits that turn red when mature. These fruits are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor, often used in traditional bush tucker. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
