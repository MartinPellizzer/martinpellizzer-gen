    "intro": "Erythraea maritima, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well adapted to maritime environments. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Erythraea maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
