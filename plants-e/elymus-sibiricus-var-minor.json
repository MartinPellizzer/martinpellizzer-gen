    "intro": "Elymus sibiricus var. minor, commonly known as Siberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe regions. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
