It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes other species such as willows and evening primroses. Epilobium barcinonense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
