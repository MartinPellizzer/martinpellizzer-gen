    "intro": "Echinocereus pulchellus var. costatus, commonly known as the Costate Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, often featuring a ribbed structure that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments with minimal rainfall. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
