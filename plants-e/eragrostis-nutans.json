    "intro": "Eragrostis nutans, commonly known as drooping beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Eragrostis nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
