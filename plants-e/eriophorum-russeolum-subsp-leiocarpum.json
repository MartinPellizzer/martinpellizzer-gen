    "intro": "Eriophorum russeolum subsp. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-sheathed cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton, which are composed of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs, marshes, and tundra environments. Its leaves are cylindrical and often covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The subspecies leiocarpum is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous sheaths and smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other subspecies of Eriophorum russeolum."
