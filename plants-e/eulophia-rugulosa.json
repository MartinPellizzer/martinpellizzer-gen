    "intro": "Eulophia rugulosa, commonly known as the rough-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination. Eulophia rugulosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
