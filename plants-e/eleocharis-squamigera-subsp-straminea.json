    "intro": "Eleocharis squamigera subsp. straminea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelets. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The subspecies straminea is distinguished by its narrower leaves and lighter coloration compared to other subspecies of Eleocharis."
