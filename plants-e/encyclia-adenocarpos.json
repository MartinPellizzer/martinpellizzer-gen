    "intro": "Encyclia adenocarpos, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, spurred orchid flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native drought-prone environment. Encyclia adenocarpos is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
