    "intro": "Eclipta procumbens, commonly known as Jerusalem artichoke, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible tubers that are rich in inulin, a type of dietary fiber. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it both a useful crop and an invasive species in some regions."
