It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate blooms and drought tolerance."
