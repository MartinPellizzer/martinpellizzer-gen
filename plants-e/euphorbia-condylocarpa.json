    "intro": "Euphorbia condylocarpa, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features distinctive, spiny stems that are often branched and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually small and may be present during the growing season but shed during dormancy. Euphorbia condylocarpa is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water."
