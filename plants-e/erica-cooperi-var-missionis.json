    "intro": "Erica cooperi var. missionis, commonly known as the Mission Heather, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has leathery, dark green foliage that is resistant to drought and salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in mild coastal climates."
