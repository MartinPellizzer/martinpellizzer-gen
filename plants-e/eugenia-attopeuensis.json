    "intro": "Eugenia attopeuensis, commonly known as the Attopeu enigma, is a rare and little-studied species native to the mountainous regions of northern Peru and southern Ecuador. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes many aromatic and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed raw or used in local traditional recipes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
