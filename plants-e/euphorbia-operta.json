    "intro": "Euphorbia operta, commonly known as the shield tree or sacred tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, shield-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia operta is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
