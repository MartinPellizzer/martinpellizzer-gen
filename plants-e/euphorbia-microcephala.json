    "intro": "Euphorbia microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf crown-of-thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is adorned with small, spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
