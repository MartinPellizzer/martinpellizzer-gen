    "intro": "Echium ortizii, commonly known as the Ortiz's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in a composite structure. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are generally narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Echium ortizii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
