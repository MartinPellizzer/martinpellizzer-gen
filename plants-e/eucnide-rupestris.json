    "intro": "Eucnide rupestris, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to drought conditions. Eucnide rupestris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
