    "intro": "Erica nidularia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Erica nidularia is well-suited to rocky or sandy habitats and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
