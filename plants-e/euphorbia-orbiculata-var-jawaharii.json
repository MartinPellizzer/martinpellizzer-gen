    "intro": "Euphorbia orbiculata var. jawaharii, commonly known as the Persian spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Iran. It features a distinctive, thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Euphorbia orbiculata var. jawaharii is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
