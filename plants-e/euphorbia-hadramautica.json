    "intro": "Euphorbia hadramautica, commonly known as the Hadramaut euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, further adapting to its harsh environment. Euphorbia hadramautica is well-suited for xerophytic conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
