    "intro": "Erica denticularis, commonly known as the serrated heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western and southern coasts of Britain and Ireland. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 cm and features dense, leathery leaves that are finely toothed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal environments. Erica denticularis is a hardy plant that is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
