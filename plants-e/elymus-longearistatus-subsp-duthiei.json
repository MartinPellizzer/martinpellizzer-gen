    "intro": "Elymus longearistatus subsp. duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage is often used by wildlife for forage, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly longer and more rigid leaves compared to other members of the Elymus genus."
