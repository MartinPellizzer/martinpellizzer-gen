It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by reddish-brown berries. It is adaptable to various soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Elaeagnus elongatus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
