    "intro": "Epidendrum yacuriense, commonly known as the Yacuri orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a striking contrast between the petals and sepals. Its pseudobulbs are typically clustered and covered in a dense layer of roots, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Epidendrum yacuriense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
