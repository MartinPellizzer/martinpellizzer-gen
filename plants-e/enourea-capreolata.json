    "intro": "Enourea capreolata, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and has a woody stem with large, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich nature and bright coloration. Enourea capreolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
