    "intro": "Elymus confusus var. breviaristatus, commonly known as the short-bracted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces inflorescences that are spike-like, with short, bract-like structures that distinguish it from other varieties. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
