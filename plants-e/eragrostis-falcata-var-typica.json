    "intro": "Eragrostis falcata var. typica, commonly known as weeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its drooping, feathery inflorescence that gives it a distinctive, almost weeping appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
