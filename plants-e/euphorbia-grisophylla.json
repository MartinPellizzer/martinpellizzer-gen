    "intro": "Euphorbia grisophylla, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, which is a swollen stem base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a greyish-green color and a dense covering of fine hairs. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often shed during periods of drought. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
