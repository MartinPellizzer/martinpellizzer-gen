    "intro": "Eucalyptus melliodora var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by distinctive, narrow, woody capsules. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands. It plays an important ecological role, providing habitat and food for native fauna."
