    "intro": "Empetrum album, commonly known as white crowfoot, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It has small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant features dense, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It thrives in poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Empetrum album is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal."
