It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is closely related to other aromatic spices like cardamom and turmeric. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its rhizomes, which are the underground stems, are the primary part used for its aromatic properties. The essential oils extracted from Elettaria kapitensis are valued for their fragrance and potential medicinal applications."
