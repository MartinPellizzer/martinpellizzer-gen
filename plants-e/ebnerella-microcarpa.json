    "intro": "Ebnerella microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant features a low-growing, mat-like structure with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry conditions. Its flowers are small and usually pale green or yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Ebnerella microcarpa is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it an important component of local flora in its native range."
