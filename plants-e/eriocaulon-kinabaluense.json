    "intro": "Eriocaulon kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu hairgrass, is a small aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, shaded, and moist environments, often found in mountain streams and pools. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many members of the Eriocaulaceae family. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
