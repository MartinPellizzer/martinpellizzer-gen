    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and relatively small, greenish-yellow flowers that often lack the typical orchid fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose raceme and are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies. The species is notable for its ability to hybridize with other epipactis species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
