    "intro": "Encyclia, commonly known as the orchid butterfly, is a genus of tropical orchids native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their compact, often epiphytic growth habit and their showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water storage in their natural habitat. Encyclia species produce small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. They are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
