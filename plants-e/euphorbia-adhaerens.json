    "intro": "Euphorbia adhaerens, commonly known as the clinging euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that can grow close to the ground, often adhering to rocks or other surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
