    "intro": "Epidendrum gracilicaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments."
