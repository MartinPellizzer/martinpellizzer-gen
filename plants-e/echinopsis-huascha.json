It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and produces large, showy flowers during the night. The plant has a thick, spiny stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and bloom in late winter or early spring. Echinopsis huascha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
