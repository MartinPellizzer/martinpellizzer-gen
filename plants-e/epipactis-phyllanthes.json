    "intro": "Epipactis phyllanthes, commonly known as the yellow helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves and a striking yellowish-green flower spike. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent lips, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Epipactis phyllanthes is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
