    "intro": "Eriodendron orientale, commonly known as the Chinese flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange floral bracts that resemble flames, which appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape and have a smooth upper surface. Its flowers are actually small, clustered inflorescences surrounded by the showy bracts. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 15 meters tall in its natural habitat."
