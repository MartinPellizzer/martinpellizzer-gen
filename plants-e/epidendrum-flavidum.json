It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Epidendrum flavidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
