    "intro": "Euphorbia negromontana subsp. negromontana, commonly known as the black mountain spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features a woody stem with a dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with a waxy coating. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
