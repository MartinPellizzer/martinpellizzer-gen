    "intro": "Euphorbia villosula, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced or absent, with the stems performing a photosynthetic function. Euphorbia villosula is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for arid environments."
