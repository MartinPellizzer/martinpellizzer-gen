    "intro": "Euphorbia beharensis var. adpressifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
