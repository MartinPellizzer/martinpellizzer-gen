    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. subalbidum, commonly known as the lesser bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
