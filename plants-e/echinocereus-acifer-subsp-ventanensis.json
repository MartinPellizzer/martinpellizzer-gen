    "intro": "Echinocereus acifer subsp. ventanensis, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
