It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. This orchid-like plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
