    "intro": "Elaeagnus glabra var. ovalifolia, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white, glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by reddish-brown berries that are an important food source for birds. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
