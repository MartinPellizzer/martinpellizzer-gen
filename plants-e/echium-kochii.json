    "intro": "Echium kochii, commonly known as the Koch's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves help reduce water loss through transpiration. Echium kochii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
