    "intro": "Eurotia lanata, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating on its stems and branches. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, attaching itself to the roots of host plants such as grasses and shrubs. It produces small, yellowish flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
