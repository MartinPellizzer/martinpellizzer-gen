It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown bracts. It thrives in wet, fertile soils and is often found in rice paddies and other cultivated areas. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a significant weed in agricultural systems."
