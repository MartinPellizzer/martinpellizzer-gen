It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a tall tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. The flowers are usually white or pale blue, and they are followed by woody capsules that release small, rounded seeds."
