    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus subsp. pectinatus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruits, known as tunas, are edible and have a sweet, slightly tart flavor. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a slow growth rate."
