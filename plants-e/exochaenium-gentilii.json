    "intro": "Exochaenium gentilii, commonly known as the Gentile's grass, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low water availability. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
