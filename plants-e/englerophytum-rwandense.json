    "intro": "Englerophytum rwandense, commonly known as the Rwandan star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Rwanda. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical bulbs underground. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
