    "intro": "Eugenia lempana, commonly known as the white-leaved eugenia, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically white to pale green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range from white to pale pink, which bloom in spring. These flowers are followed by small, round, edible fruits that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. Eugenia lempana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
