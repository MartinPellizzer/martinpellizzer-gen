    "intro": "Eriocaulon rosenii, commonly known as the Rosenvale's spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Eriocaulon rosenii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
