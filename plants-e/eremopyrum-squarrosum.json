    "intro": "Eremopyrum squarrosum, commonly known as the desert tansy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss. Eremopyrum squarrosum is known for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
