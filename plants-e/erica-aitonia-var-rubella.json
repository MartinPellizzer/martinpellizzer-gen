    "intro": "Erica aitonia var. rubella, commonly known as the red heather, is a dwarf evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its profusion of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically a dark green color. Erica aitonia var. rubella is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
