    "intro": "Echinocactus lenninghausii, commonly known as the Leninghaus's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xeriscaping."
