    "intro": "Eupatorium ulei, commonly known as roughleaf eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the common name, and are often covered in fine hairs. Eupatorium ulei is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
