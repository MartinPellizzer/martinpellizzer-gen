    "intro": "Eucalyptus gigantangion, commonly known as the giant honeyeater eucalypt, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the eastern coast of Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The wood of Eucalyptus gigantangion is lightweight and has been historically used for furniture and construction."
