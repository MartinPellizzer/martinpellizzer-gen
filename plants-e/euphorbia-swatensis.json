    "intro": "Euphorbia swatensis, commonly known as the Swat spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its tissues to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia swatensis is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
