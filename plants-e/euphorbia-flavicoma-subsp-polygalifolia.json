    "intro": "Euphorbia flavicoma subsp. polygalifolia, commonly known as the golden-hair euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, branched stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, yellowish hairs. The leaves are small, ovate, and often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
