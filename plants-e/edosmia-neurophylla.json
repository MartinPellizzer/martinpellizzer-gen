    "intro": "Edosmia neurophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed edosmia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
