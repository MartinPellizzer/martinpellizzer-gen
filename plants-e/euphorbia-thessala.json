    "intro": "Euphorbia thessala, commonly known as the Cretan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Crete. It features a short, thick stem with a distinctive greenish-gray color and produces small, yellowish flower clusters. The plant has a spiny appearance, with branched spines along its stem, which serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. Euphorbia thessala is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
