    "intro": "Eriospermum hygrophilum, commonly known as the marsh eriosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in moist habitats, and it thrives in areas with standing or flowing water. Eriospermum hygrophilum is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
