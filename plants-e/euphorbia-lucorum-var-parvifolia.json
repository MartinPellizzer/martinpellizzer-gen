It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean regions. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation or study."
