    "intro": "Epidendrum francisci, commonly known as the Saint Helena Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short, stocky rhizome and a few pairs of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its island habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
