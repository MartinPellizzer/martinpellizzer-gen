    "intro": "Epidendrum durum, commonly known as the hardy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Epidendrum durum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its resilience and ornamental value."
