    "intro": "Eriachne mucronata var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved eriachne, is a grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal or inland grasslands. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native vegetation."
