    "intro": "Eria lacei, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along streams. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its intricate structure. Eria lacei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
