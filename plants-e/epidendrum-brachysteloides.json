    "intro": "Epidendrum brachysteloides, commonly known as the compact epiphyte, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features dense, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a variety of colors including white, pink, and purple. Epidendrum brachysteloides is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good light for optimal growth."
