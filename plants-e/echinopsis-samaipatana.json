    "intro": "Echinopsis samaipatana, commonly known as the Samaipata cactus, is a striking species native to Bolivia and northern Argentina. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus enthusiasts."
