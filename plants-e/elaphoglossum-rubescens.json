    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern species native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive reddish hue on the stems and undersides. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum rubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
