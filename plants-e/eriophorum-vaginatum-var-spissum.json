    "intro": "Eriophorum vaginatum var. spissum, commonly known as the tufted tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on elongated, cylindrical inflorescences. Its roots form extensive rhizomes, helping to stabilize soil in wetland habitats. This variety is an important component of northern wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
