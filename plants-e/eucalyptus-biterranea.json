    "intro": "Eucalyptus biterranea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus biterranea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is also known for its high essential oil content, which contributes to its distinctive scent and various traditional uses."
