    "intro": "Elaphoglossum sherringii, commonly known as the Sherring's holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
