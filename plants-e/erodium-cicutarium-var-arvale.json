    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. arvale, commonly known as redstem filaree, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or reddish flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a pithy, three-lobed capsule, which disperses easily by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
