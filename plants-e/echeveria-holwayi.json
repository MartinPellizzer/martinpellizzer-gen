    "intro": "Echeveria holwayi, commonly known as the Holway's echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces clusters of pink to magenta flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
