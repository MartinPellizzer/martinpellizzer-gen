    "intro": "Euphorbia poissonii, commonly known as the Poisson's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with its thick, fleshy stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
