It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are usually white or pale pink. Echinopterys species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where they play a role in local ecosystems."
