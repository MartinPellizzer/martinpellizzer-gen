    "intro": "Eurostorhiza, commonly known as the swamp aster, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in marshy areas and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Eurostorhiza plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
