    "intro": "Elatostema shuii, commonly known as the water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. Its roots are submerged and often form dense mats that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Elatostema shuii is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
