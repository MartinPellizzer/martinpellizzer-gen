    "intro": "Elaeocarpus finlaysonianus, commonly known as the Finlayson's elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are encased in a thick, woody husk. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
