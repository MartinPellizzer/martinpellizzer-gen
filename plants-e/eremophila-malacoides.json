    "intro": "Eremophila malacoides, commonly known as the honeycomb bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive honeycomb-like structures on its stems, which are covered in a waxy, resinous coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple, often appearing in clusters. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Eremophila malacoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
