    "intro": "Euphorbia cupanii var. spartioides, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
