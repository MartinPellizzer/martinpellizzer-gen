    "intro": "Eriophorum intercedens var. rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are often reddish in color, giving it its common name. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
