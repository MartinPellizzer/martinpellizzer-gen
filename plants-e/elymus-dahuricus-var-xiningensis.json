    "intro": "Elymus dahuricus var. xiningensis, commonly known as the Xining wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus dahuricus var. xiningensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
