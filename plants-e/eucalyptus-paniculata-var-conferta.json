It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often greyish-green in color. The tree produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
