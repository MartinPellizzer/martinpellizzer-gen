It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple spherical flower heads that resemble small combs. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into hard, seed-filled capsules. Echinops kerneri is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
