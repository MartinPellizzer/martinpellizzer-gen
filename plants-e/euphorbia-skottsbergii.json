    "intro": "Euphorbia skottsbergii, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, spiky inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, giving it its common name. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a notable addition to botanical collections."
