    "intro": "Elymus fibrosus, commonly known as the fibrous grass or western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in panicle-like clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, awned florets. Elymus fibrosus is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
