    "intro": "Ebenus macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Ebenus macrophylla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
