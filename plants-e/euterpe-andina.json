    "intro": "Euterpe andina, commonly known as the Andean palm, is a species of palm native to the highlands of South America. It is characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are followed by edible fruits. The fruits are typically small, sweet, and have a texture similar to a banana. Euterpe andina is adapted to grow in cool, high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests."
