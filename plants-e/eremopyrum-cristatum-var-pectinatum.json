    "intro": "Eremopyrum cristatum var. pectinatum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble a crown or a tuft of wool. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and with minimal water. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a forage species in dryland ecosystems."
