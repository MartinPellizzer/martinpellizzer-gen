    "intro": "Echinocactus wislizeni f. albispinus, commonly known as the white-spined hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking variant of the hedgehog cactus. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are covered in white spines, distinguishing it from the typical green spines of the standard species. The plant is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to survive. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in cactus collections and desert gardens."
