    "intro": "Eulophia versteegii, commonly known as the Versteeg's eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering structures. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, making it well-suited to humid environments. Eulophia versteegii is often found in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade and high humidity."
