    "intro": "Espeletia trianae, commonly known as the Tepuy Espeletia, is a striking plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments, often growing in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology helps it conserve moisture and withstand strong winds. Espeletia trianae is also noted for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its mountainous habitat."
