    "intro": "Edgaria darjeelingensis var. clarkeana, commonly known as the Darjeeling edgaria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant thrives in the cool, moist climates of high-altitude regions, typically found in dense forests. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
