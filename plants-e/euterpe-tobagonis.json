    "intro": "Euterpe tobagonis, commonly known as the Tobago palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and the Bahamas. It is a small to medium-sized palm with a slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by small, round fruits that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and forested regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
