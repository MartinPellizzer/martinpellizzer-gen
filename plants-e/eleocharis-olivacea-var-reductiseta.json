    "intro": "Eleocharis olivacea var. reductiseta, commonly known as the narrow beak sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. This variety is characterized by its reduced flowering structures compared to the typical form of Eleocharis olivacea."
