    "intro": "Euphorbia decepta subsp. decepta, commonly known as the deceptive euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching out into a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically spiny and adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
