    "intro": "Erythroxylum nitidulum f. leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender-leaved copal tree, is a flowering plant species native to Central America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It is typically found in humid, lowland forest environments, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soils. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
