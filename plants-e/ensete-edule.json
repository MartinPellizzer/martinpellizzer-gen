    "intro": "Ensete edule, commonly known as the false banana, is a large, herbaceous plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the Musaceae family, which also includes true bananas and plantains. The plant produces a pseudostem composed of tightly packed leaf sheaths, and its leaves can grow up to 3 meters in length. The edible part of the plant is the starchy, fibrous pith found inside the pseudostem, which is used in various culinary preparations. Ensete edule is also valued for its role in traditional agriculture and as a source of fiber and fuel."
