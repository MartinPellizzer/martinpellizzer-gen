It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Ephedra foliata is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes is well-documented."
