    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia subsp. purpurata, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, pleated leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. The subspecies purpurata is distinguished by its more vibrant purple hues compared to other forms of Epipactis latifolia."
