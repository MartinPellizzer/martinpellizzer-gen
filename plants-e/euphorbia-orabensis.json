    "intro": "Euphorbia orabensis, commonly known as the Orabens spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common feature among members of this genus. Euphorbia orabensis is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
