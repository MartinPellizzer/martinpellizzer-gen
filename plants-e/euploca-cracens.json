    "intro": "Euploca cracens, commonly known as the silky grass or silky euploca, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet, marshy habitats, often near water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom during the rainy season. Euploca cracens is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in wetland gardens."
