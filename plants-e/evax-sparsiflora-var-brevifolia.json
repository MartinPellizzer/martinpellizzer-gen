    "intro": "Evax sparsiflora var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sparsiflora, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its foliage is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments, often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
