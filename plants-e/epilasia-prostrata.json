    "intro": "Epilasia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate epilasia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Epilasia prostrata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
