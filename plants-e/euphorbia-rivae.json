    "intro": "Euphorbia rivae, commonly known as the Rivai's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its stems. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
