It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
