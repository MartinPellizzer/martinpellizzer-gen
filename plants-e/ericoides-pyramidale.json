    "intro": "Ericoides pyramidale, commonly known as the pyramidal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils. Ericoides pyramidale is adapted to harsh, acidic environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests."
