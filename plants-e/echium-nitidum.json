    "intro": "Echium nitidum, commonly known as the smooth evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in the late afternoon and evening. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. The seed capsules that follow the flowers are hairy and contain numerous small, oily seeds."
