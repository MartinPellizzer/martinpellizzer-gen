    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus subsp. neglectus, commonly known as the Alpine blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disc florets, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
