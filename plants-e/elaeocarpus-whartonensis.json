    "intro": "Elaeocarpus whartonensis, commonly known as the Wharton's elaeocarp, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a dense, woolly coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
