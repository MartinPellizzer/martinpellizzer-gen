    "intro": "Eclipta prostrata var. dixitii, commonly known as the prostrate false dandelion, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features a sprawling growth habit with slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine hairs. This species is commonly found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
