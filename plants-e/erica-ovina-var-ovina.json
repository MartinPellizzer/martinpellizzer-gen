    "intro": "Erica ovina var. ovina, commonly known as the heather or dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It typically features compact, wiry stems covered in dense clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica ovina var. ovina is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
