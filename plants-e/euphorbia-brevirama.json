    "intro": "Euphorbia brevirama, commonly known as the short-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, compact form with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures, often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, providing some protection from intense sunlight. Euphorbia brevirama is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
