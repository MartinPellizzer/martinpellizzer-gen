    "intro": "Euphorbia esuliformis var. subdentata, commonly known as the serrated euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The leaves are small, alternate, and typically have serrated edges, which is reflected in its scientific name. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic inflorescences. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
