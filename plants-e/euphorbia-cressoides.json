    "intro": "Euphorbia cressoides, commonly known as the cress-like spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring a short, thick stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
