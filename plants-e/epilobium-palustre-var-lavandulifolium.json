    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. lavandulifolium, commonly known as swamp willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often covered with soft, glandular hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin, and have a distinctive aromatic scent reminiscent of lavender. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
