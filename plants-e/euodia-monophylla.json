    "intro": "Euodia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing numerous seeds. Euodia monophylla is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats."
