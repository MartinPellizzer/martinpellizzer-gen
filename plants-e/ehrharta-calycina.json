    "intro": "Ehrharta calycina, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas. Ehrharta calycina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
