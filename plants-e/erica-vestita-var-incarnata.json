It features dense, compact foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
