    "intro": "Euonymus marivelensis, commonly known as the Marivel's spindletree, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cercidiphyllaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often red-tinged, four-angled stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a slightly waxy texture. Euonymus marivelensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
