    "intro": "Eupatorium purpureum f. falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved purple stem, is a variant of the purple stem plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
