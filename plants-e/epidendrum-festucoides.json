    "intro": "Epidendrum festucoides, commonly known as the grassy epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and long, grass-like leaves that often form dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne on erect inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Epidendrum festucoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
