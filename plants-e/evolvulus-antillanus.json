    "intro": "Evolvulus antillanus, commonly known as the common blue morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in gardens. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental planting, though it can become invasive in some regions."
