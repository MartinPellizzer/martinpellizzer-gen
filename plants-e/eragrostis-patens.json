    "intro": "Eragrostis patens, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and wildlife habitat. Eragrostis patens is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
