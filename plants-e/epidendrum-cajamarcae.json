    "intro": "Epidendrum cajamarcae, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its blooming period typically occurs during the cooler months, and it thrives in well-drained, loose soil. Epidendrum cajamarcae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
