    "intro": "Eulophia williamsonii, commonly known as the Williamson's eulophia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth or on tree trunks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Eulophia williamsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
