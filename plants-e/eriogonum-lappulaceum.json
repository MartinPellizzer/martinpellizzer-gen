    "intro": "Eriogonum lappulaceum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its grayish-green foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh desert conditions. Eriogonum lappulaceum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
