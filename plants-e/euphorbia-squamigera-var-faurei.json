    "intro": "Euphorbia squamigera var. faurei, commonly known as the Faure's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem covered in dense, white to greyish woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered with a similar coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water."
