It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive blue-green hue when fresh. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale yellow to cream in color. The plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
