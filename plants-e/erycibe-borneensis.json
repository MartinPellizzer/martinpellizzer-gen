    "intro": "Erycibe borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean erycibe, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, Erycibe borneensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
