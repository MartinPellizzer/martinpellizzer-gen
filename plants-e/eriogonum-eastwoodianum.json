    "intro": "Eriogonum eastwoodianum, commonly known as Eastwood's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, small white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds via the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
