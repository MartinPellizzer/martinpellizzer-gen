    "intro": "Eriophorum sphaerocephalum, commonly known as the spherical cottongrass, is a low-growing plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy white flower heads that form spherical clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that are often surrounded by sterile, hairy bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically forming a rosette at the base. Eriophorum sphaerocephalum thrives in wet, nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of tundra and moorland ecosystems."
