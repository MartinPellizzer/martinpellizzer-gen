    "intro": "Erythrina hamiltoniana, commonly known as the Hamilton's coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves composed of three to five leaflets, and its structure includes a woody stem with thorns. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing as a small tree or shrub. The seeds are encased in a hard, pod-like fruit that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds for propagation."
