    "intro": "Eichhornia meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces striking blue-violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can rapidly spread through vegetative reproduction. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
