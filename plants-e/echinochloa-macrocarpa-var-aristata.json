    "intro": "Echinochloa macrocarpa var. aristata, commonly known as large-fruit lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a dense covering of fine hairs. The leaves are narrow, linear, and typically have a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of dense pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. This plant is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides."
