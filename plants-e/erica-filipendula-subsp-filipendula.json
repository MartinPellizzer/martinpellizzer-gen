    "intro": "Erica filipendula subsp. filipendula, commonly known as the purple heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
