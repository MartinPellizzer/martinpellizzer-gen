    "intro": "Elymus strictus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil. Elymus strictus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
