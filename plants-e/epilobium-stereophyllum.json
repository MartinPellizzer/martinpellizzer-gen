    "intro": "Epilobium stereophyllum, commonly known as the mountain willow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems that become branched and bushy with age, giving it a shrub-like appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of hairs. Epilobium stereophyllum is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
