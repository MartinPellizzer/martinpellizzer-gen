It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Ecbolium divergens f. minus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
