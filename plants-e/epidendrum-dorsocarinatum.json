    "intro": "Epidendrum dorsocarinatum, commonly known as the Spine-Backed Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, dark green leaves with prominent, raised veins that give it a distinctive \"spiny\" appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Epidendrum dorsocarinatum is a popular choice for collectors due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
