    "intro": "Eupatorium obtusisquamosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and opposite, broad, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Eupatorium obtusisquamosum is often found in association with other wetland plants and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
