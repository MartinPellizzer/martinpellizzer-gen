It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red berries that are rich in antioxidants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
