    "intro": "Eleocharis koyamae, commonly known as the Koyama sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to Japan and is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond margins. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense vegetation in its native environment. Eleocharis koyamae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
