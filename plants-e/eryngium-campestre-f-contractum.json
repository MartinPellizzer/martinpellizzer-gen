    "intro": "Eryngium campestre f. contractum, commonly known as the compact thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The subspecies is distinguished by its more condensed leaf structure compared to the typical form of Eryngium campestre."
