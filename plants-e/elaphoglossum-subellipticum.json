    "intro": "Elaphoglossum subellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-elliptic holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and are protected by a small, kidney-shaped indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
