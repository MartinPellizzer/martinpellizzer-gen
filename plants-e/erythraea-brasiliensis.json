    "intro": "Erythraea brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian erythraea, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture, which helps it adapt to the humid and often shaded environments of its native habitat. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
