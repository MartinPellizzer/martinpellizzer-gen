    "intro": "Epipactis atrorubens f. orbicularis, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns of white and green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and ovate, and the inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike bearing numerous flowers. This orchid is notable for its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems as a pollinator attractant."
