    "intro": "Erythroxylum cryptanthum, commonly known as the cryptanthum coca, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical berries that contain the psychoactive alkaloid coca. It is closely related to Erythroxylum coca, from which traditional coca leaves are derived. Due to its botanical similarities, it is often studied for its potential ecological and pharmacological significance."
