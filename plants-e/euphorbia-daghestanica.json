    "intro": "Euphorbia daghestanica, commonly known as the Daghestan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species. Euphorbia daghestanica is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
