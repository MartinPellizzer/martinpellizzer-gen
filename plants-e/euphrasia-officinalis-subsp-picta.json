    "intro": "Euphrasia officinalis subsp. picta, commonly known as the spotted eyebright, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, upright stems and small, bright yellow flowers with prominent dark spots. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This subspecies is particularly noted for its ornamental value due to its striking floral pattern and is often cultivated in gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
