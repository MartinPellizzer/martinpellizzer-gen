This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. It has finely divided, gray-green leaves and produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Erigeron \u00d7 queraltii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
