    "intro": "Eriocoma parishii subsp. depauperata, commonly known as the slender eriocoma, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its sparse, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the broader Eriocoma parishii species. This plant plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
