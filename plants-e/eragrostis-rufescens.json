    "intro": "Eragrostis rufescens, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often appear in dense clumps. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray appearance due to the presence of fine pubescence. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments."
