    "intro": "Encyclia neurosa, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are typically borne on erect, branched inflorescences. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Encyclia neurosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
