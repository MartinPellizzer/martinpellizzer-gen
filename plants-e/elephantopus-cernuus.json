    "intro": "Elephantopus cernuus, commonly known as the creeping elephant's foot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or well-drained soils. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides."
