    "intro": "Encephalartos altensteinii var. eriocephalus, commonly known as the eriocephalus cycad, is a rare and distinctive member of the Zamiaceae family. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and dense, fan-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, yellowish cones that are often hidden beneath the foliage, making them difficult to spot. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to South Africa. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
