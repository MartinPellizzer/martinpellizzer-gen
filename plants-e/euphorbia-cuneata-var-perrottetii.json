    "intro": "Euphorbia cuneata var. perrottetii, commonly known as the redleaf spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped leaves that range in color from green to red, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in xeriscaping for its ornamental value."
