    "intro": "Eremogone gypsophiloides, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Eremogone gypsophiloides is an important plant for pollinators and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
