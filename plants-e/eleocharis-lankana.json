    "intro": "Eleocharis lankana, commonly known as the Lankan spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland and marshy habitats in southern Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Eleocharis lankana plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
