    "intro": "Elytraria apargiifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf elytraria, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing tiny, white or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
