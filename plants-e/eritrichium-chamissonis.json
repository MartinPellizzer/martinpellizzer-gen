    "intro": "Eritrichium chamissonis, commonly known as the Chamisson's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, white trichomes. The plant produces clusters of tiny, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cool, humid climates and it is often found in montane regions."
