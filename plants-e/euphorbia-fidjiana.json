    "intro": "Euphorbia fidjiana, commonly known as the Fijian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Vanua Levu in Fiji. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Euphorbia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
