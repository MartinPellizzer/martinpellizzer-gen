    "intro": "Encyclia adenocaula var. kennedyi, commonly known as Kennedy's pineapple orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, strap-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically arranged in a pineapple-like cluster. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining substrates. Due to its unique appearance and horticultural appeal, it is a popular specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
