    "intro": "Eugenia irazuensis, commonly known as the Iraz\u00fa myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to Costa Rica, specifically the Iraz\u00fa Volcano region, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It produces small, edible berries that are often used in local traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eugenia irazuensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
