    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaesula var. subdentata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
