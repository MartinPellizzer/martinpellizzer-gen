    "intro": "Eremostachys canescens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Eremostachys canescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
