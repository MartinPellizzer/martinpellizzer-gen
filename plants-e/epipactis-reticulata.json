    "intro": "Epipactis reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with specific fungal partners. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Epipactis reticulata is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, humid environments."
