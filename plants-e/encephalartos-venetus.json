    "intro": "Encephalartos venetus, commonly known as the Cape York cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Encephalartos venetus is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several decades in age. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
