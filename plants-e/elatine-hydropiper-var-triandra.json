    "intro": "Elatine hydropiper var. triandra, commonly known as the water pepper, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts to aid in buoyancy. This species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, moist habitats and is often found in temperate regions."
