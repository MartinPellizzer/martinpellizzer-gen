    "intro": "Echites cururu, commonly known as the curly devil, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spirally twisted stems that give it a unique and eye-catching appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its distinctive form and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
