It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically has strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum isthmoides is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
