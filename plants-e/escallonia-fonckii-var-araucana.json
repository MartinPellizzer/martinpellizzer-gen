    "intro": "Escallonia fonckii var. araucana, commonly known as the Araucana Escallonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and emit a subtle, spicy fragrance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in spring. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and long-lasting blooms."
