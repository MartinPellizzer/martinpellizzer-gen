    "intro": "Euphorbia scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a distinctive, rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
