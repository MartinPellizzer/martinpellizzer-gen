    "intro": "Epidendrum dolichobotryoides, commonly known as the long-stemmed epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow pseudobulbs that support its foliage. The plant produces pendant inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
