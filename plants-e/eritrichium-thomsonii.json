    "intro": "Eritrichium thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in areas with rocky soils and high elevations. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in early spring. It has hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Thomson's mouse-ear is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
