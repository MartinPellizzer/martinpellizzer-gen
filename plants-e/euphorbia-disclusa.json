    "intro": "Euphorbia disclusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified floral structures. It has a milky sap that can be toxic and is a characteristic feature of the Euphorbia genus. Euphorbia disclusa is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
