    "intro": "Euphorbia pandurifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf spurges, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
