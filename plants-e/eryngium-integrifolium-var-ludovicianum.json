It features spiny, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has deeply lobed, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pollinator plant, attracting bees and other insects."
