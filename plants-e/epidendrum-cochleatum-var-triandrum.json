    "intro": "Epidendrum cochleatum var. triandrum, commonly known as the Triangular Epidendrum, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
