It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are dark red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Eumecanthus triphyllus is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
