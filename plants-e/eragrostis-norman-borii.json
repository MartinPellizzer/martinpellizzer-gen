    "intro": "Eragrostis norman-borii, commonly known as Norman-Borii grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
