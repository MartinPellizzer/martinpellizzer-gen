    "intro": "Exochorda racemosa f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate meadowsweet, is a low-growing, flowering shrub native to the eastern United States. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or ground covers. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, white hairs. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, partially shaded environments."
