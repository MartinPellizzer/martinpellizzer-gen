    "intro": "Euphorbia corollata var. glauca, commonly known as the blueleaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous erect, branched stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, which gives the plant its distinguishing appearance. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. The plant contains milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a characteristic feature of the Euphorbia genus."
