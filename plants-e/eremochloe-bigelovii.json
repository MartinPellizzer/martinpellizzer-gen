    "intro": "Eremochloe bigelovii, commonly known as the bigelov's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Eremochloe bigelovii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
