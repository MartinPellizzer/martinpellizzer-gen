    "intro": "Eugenia cordata, commonly known as the wax myrtle or sweet myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It has lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Eugenia cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
