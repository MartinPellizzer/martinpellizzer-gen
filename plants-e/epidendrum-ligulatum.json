    "intro": "Epidendrum ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum ligulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
