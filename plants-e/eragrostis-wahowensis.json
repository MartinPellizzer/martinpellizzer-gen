    "intro": "Eragrostis wahowensis, commonly known as the Wahowen grass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in savanna and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects in arid environments."
