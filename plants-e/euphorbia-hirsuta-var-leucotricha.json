    "intro": "Euphorbia hirsuta var. leucotricha, commonly known as the white-haired spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white-hairy foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
