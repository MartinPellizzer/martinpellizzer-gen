    "intro": "Erythrocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, fragrant flowers that open at night. They are typically succulent, with thick, fleshy stems adapted to store water. Many species produce edible fruits, which are often small and berry-like. Erythrocereus species are popular in horticulture for their striking appearance and unique blooming habits."
