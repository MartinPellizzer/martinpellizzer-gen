    "intro": "Encyclia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Encyclia pringlei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
