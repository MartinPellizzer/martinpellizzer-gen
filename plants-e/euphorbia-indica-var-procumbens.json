    "intro": "Euphorbia indica var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Southeast Asia. It features fleshy, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
