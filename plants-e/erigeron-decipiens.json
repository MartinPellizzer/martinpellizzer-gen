    "intro": "Erigeron decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly in the central and western regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with ray florets that may appear similar to those of other Erigeron species, leading to its common name. It is often found in dry, sunny environments and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils."
