    "intro": "Elaphoglossum marginatum, commonly known as the marginspore fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered along the margins of the fronds, giving it its common name. Elaphoglossum marginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
