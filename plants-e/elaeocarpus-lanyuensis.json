It is native to the island of Lanyu, located off the southeastern coast of Taiwan. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
