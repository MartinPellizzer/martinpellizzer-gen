The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense spikes at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fragrance and visual interest."
