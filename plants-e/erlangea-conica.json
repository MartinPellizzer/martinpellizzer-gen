    "intro": "Erlangea conica, commonly known as the conical erlangia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive conical shape and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged spirally along its stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
