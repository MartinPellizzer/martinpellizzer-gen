    "intro": "Eurya nitida subsp. venosa, commonly known as the glossyleaf eurya, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
