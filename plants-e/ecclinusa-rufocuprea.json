    "intro": "Ecclinusa rufocuprea, commonly known as the red-cup fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a reddish hue on the underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Ecclinusa rufocuprea plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
