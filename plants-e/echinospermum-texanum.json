    "intro": "Echinospermum texanum, commonly known as Texas thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces achenes, which are dry, one-seeded fruits that are typically covered in bristles. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its thistle-like appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other similar species in the Asteraceae family."
