It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Elymus tauri is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and open habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
