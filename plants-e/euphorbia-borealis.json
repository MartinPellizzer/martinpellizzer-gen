    "intro": "Euphorbia borealis, commonly known as the Arctic spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a woody stem covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves known as bracts. Euphorbia borealis thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens for its hardy nature."
