    "intro": "Espeletiopsis funckii, commonly known as the Funck's espeletiopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
