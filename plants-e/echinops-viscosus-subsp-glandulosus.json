    "intro": "Echinops viscosus subsp. glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, globe-shaped seed heads and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
