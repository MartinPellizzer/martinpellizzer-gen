    "intro": "Echium pustulatum, commonly known as the bladderflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive bladders-like structures on its stems, which are modified leaves used for water storage. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Echium pustulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
