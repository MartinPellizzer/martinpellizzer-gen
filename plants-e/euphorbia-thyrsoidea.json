    "intro": "Euphorbia thyrsoidea, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem with a smooth, greenish-gray bark and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. It is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Euphorbia thyrsoidea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
