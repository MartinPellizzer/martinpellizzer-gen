    "intro": "Echinopsis dobeana, commonly known as the Dobeana cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces striking clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, typically in late summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Echinopsis dobeana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
