    "intro": "Eupatorium piquerioides, commonly known as the Florida boneset, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as swamps and wetlands, and it features tall, slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its showy white to pale blue flower heads bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Eupatorium piquerioides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
