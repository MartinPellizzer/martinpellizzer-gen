    "intro": "Egletes viscosa var. dissecta, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the entire plant, providing a unique texture and appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed."
