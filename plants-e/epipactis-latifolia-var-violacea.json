    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. violacea, commonly known as the violet helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature of the orchid family, and it produces small, greenish-black fruits that contain seeds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
