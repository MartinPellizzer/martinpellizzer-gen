    "intro": "Epidendrum deamii, commonly known as the Deam's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically has strap-like, dark green leaves that are relatively narrow and pointed. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum deamii is a popular choice for both indoor and greenhouse cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
