    "intro": "Eucomis nana, commonly known as the cannonball plant, is a compact, bulbous perennial native to South Africa. It features a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. During the growing season, it produces tall, spiky flower heads composed of small, white or pale blue florets. The plant is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. It requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
