    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 jubaeaphylla, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
