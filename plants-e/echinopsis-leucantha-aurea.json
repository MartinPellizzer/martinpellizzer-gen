    "intro": "Echinopsis leucantha aurea, commonly known as the White Crowned Cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant features a spiny exterior with areoles that bear both spines and flowers, typical of the Echinopsis genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and as a houseplant."
