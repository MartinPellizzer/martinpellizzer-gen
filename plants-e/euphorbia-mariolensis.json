    "intro": "Euphorbia mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolensis spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
