    "intro": "Echinolaena, commonly known as the burr grass or prickly burr, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and spikelets that often have bracts with hooked tips, which aid in seed dispersal. Echinolaena species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant's structure is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to harsh environments."
