    "intro": "Echeveria pringlei var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces vibrant violet to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container gardening."
