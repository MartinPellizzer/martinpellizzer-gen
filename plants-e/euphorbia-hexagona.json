    "intro": "Euphorbia hexagona, commonly known as the hexagonal spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive hexagonal-shaped stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water conditions. Euphorbia hexagona is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
