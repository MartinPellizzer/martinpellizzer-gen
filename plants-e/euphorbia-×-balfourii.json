It is a succulent shrub characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in yellow or greenish hues, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions. Its growth habit and appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
