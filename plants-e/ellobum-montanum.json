    "intro": "Ellobum montanum, commonly known as the mountain ellobum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Andes Mountains. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat. Ellobum montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
