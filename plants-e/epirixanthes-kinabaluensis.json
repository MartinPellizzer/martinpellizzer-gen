    "intro": "Epirixanthes kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu epirixanthes, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often on rocky substrates. It has small, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
