    "intro": "Equisetum aphyllum, commonly known as the barren scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead having whorls of small, scale-like structures along its unbranched, segmented stems. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its stems are often used for their abrasive texture in traditional cleaning practices. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Equisetum aphyllum is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back to the Paleozoic era."
