    "intro": "Echinodorus tenellus f. randii, commonly known as the compact echinodorus, is a compact, slow-growing aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, dark green leaves that are slightly wavy and often have a subtle red or purple hue under strong lighting. This plant thrives in moderate to high light conditions and requires stable water parameters with good water circulation. It is often used in foreground plantings in aquariums due to its compact growth habit and ease of maintenance. Its rhizomes form a dense mat, making it an effective choice for stabilizing substrates in planted tanks."
