    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. confertum, commonly known as swamp willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, erect stems that often grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in terminal racemes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
