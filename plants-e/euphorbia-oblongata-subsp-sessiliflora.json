    "intro": "Euphorbia oblongata subsp. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation."
