    "intro": "Epiphyllum \u00d7 jenkinsonii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus species native to Central America. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours before closing in the morning. Epiphyllum \u00d7 jenkinsonii is often grown as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior."
