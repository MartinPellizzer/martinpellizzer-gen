    "intro": "Euphorbia dulcis var. incompta, commonly known as the sweet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
