    "intro": "Euphorbia densispina, commonly known as the dense-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution to avoid skin irritation."
