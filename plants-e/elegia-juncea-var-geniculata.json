    "intro": "Elegia juncea var. geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag water starwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Halocarpyceae family and is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems. The plant typically grows in wet or muddy habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by water. This species is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
