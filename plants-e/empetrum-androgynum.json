    "intro": "Empetrum androgynum, commonly known as the common crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It has small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and heathland environments. Empetrum androgynum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic species."
