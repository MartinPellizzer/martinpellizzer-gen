It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat."
