    "intro": "Espeletia standleyana, commonly known as the \"Snowy Mountain\" or \"Cushion Plant,\" is a species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that forms a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions where conditions are harsh. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Espeletia standleyana is also known for its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
