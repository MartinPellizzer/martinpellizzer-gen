    "intro": "Eryngium paniculatum var. litorale, commonly known as the sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
