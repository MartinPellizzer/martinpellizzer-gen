    "intro": "Eugenia halophila, commonly known as the saltbush eugenia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the autumn and winter seasons. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain several seeds, and they are adapted to thrive in poorly drained, salty soils. Eugenia halophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
