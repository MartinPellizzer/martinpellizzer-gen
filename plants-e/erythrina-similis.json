    "intro": "Erythrina similis, commonly known as the red torchwood tree, is a deciduous legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its woody structure supports its role as a shade tree in various ecosystems. Erythrina similis has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, and its seeds are encased in hard pods that split open when mature. The plant is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, enhancing its role in ecological restoration."
