    "intro": "Eriogonum heracleoides var. micranthum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun exposure. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance."
