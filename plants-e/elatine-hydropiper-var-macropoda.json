    "intro": "Elatine hydropiper var. macropoda, commonly known as water pepper, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in moist to submerged environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy. This variety is characterized by its larger leaves compared to other Elatine species, which is reflected in its name \"macropoda.\""
