    "intro": "Euonymus radicans variegatus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Asia. It features waxy, elliptical leaves with distinctive variegation of white, yellow, and green, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover slopes. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and naturalized areas."
