    "intro": "Evolvulus sericeus var. falcatus, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
