    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 popovii, commonly known as the Popov's spurge, is a hybrid plant that originates from the cross between Euphorbia lathyris and Euphorbia myrsinites. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features succulent, often hairy stems and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to hybridize easily, contributing to its variability in appearance."
