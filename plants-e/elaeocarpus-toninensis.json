It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically dispersed by birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
