    "intro": "Eryngium ilicifolium, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features spiny, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant has silvery-gray, lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Eryngium ilicifolium is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
