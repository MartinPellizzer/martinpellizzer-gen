    "intro": "Empedoclesia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Empedoclesia is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an invasive species in many areas."
