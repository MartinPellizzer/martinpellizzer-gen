    "intro": "Euphorbia curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain water in arid environments. Its leaves are usually small and may be present during certain growth stages. Euphorbia curtisii is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
