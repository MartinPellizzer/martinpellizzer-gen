    "intro": "Euphorbia brachycera var. greggii, commonly known as Gregg's short-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive drought. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a notable species in desert flora."
