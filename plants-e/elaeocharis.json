    "intro": "Elaeocharis, commonly known as the spike-moss, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, grass-like appearance and often grow in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Elaeocharis species typically have narrow, cylindrical stems and produce small, clustered spikelets that contain minute flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Due to their ecological significance, some species are used in restoration projects to improve water quality and prevent erosion."
