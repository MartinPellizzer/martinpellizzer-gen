    "intro": "Encheiridion leptostele, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed book-plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage. It features a single, slender stem that branches into a rosette of compound leaves, giving it a delicate, plant-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered umbels of white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
