It features spiny, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, thistle-like purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanists and gardeners alike."
