    "intro": "Eurya hwangshanensis, commonly known as the Hwangshan eurya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Hengshan Mountains region, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that attract various bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eurya hwangshanensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
