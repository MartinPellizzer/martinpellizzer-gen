    "intro": "Epipactis greuteri, commonly known as the Greuter's helleborine, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with coniferous forests. It is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers during the summer months. Epipactis greuteri is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local insect populations."
