It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its compact and bushy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
