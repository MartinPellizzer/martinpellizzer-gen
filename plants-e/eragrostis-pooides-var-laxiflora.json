It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
