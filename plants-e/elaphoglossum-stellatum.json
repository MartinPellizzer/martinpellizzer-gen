    "intro": "Elaphoglossum stellatum, commonly known as the star-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive star-like arrangement of pinnae. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are often covered by a protective indusium. Native to tropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
