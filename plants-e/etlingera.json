    "intro": "Etlingera, commonly known as the torch ginger, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Zingiberaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific, often found in moist, shaded environments. They are characterized by their striking red or orange inflorescences, which resemble torches, hence their common name. The leaves are typically broad and sword-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Etlingera species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine."
