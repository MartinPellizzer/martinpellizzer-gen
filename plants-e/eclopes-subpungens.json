    "intro": "Eclopes subpungens, commonly known as the sharpleaf eclopes, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer. It has a fibrous root system and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in rich, loamy soils with high moisture content."
