    "intro": "Elaphoglossum gratum, commonly known as the graceful holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Elaphoglossum gratum produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its delicate appearance and ability to flourish in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental use."
