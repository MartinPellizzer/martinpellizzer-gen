    "intro": "Elaphoglossum variolatum, commonly known as the variable harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, narrow, tongue-like shape, which gives it its common name. Elaphoglossum variolatum is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
