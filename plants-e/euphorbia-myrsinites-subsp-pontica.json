    "intro": "Euphorbia myrsinites subsp. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, succulent foliage that is often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
