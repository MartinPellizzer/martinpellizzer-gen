    "intro": "Epidendrum amphistomum, commonly known as the Pink Ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help in moisture retention. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects."
