    "intro": "Eurya cavinervis var. strigillosa, commonly known as the hairy-leaf eurya, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, appressed hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential ornamental use."
