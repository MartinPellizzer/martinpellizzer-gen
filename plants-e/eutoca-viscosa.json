    "intro": "Eutoca viscosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Eutoca viscosa is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its aggressive spreading habit. Botanically, it is classified as a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as cotton and hibiscus."
