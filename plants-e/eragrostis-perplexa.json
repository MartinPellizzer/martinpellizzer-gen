It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
