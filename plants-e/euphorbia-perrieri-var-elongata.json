    "intro": "Euphorbia perrieri var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height, with sparse, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
