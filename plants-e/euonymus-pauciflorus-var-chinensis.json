    "intro": "Euonymus pauciflorus var. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and striking red-orange foliage that turns vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. Its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to urban conditions make it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
