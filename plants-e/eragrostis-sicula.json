It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Eragrostis sicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
