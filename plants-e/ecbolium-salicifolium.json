It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are typically alternate and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Ecbolium salicifolium is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
