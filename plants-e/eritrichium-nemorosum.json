    "intro": "Eritrichium nemorosum, commonly known as the woodland bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
