    "intro": "Ericoides latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf heath, is a shrub native to the wetlands and bogs of northern regions. It features small, evergreen leaves that are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in waterlogged soils. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. It is often found in acidic, nutrient-poor environments, thriving in the presence of peat and sphagnum moss. Ericoides latifolium plays a key role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity."
