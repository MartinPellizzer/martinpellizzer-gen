    "intro": "Eupatorium purpureum f. ternifolium, commonly known as the three-leaf purple coneflower, is a variant of the purple coneflower species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of purple to pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a robust root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
