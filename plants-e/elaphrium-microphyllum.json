    "intro": "Elaphrium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved elaphrium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
