    "intro": "Eupatorium amabile, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eupatorium amabile is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
