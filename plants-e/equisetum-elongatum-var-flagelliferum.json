    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. flagelliferum, commonly known as the flagellate horse tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that bears fertile strobilae at the top. The plant is typically found in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions, often near streams or in shaded woodlands. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period. This variety is distinguished by its longer, more slender stems compared to other equisetum species."
