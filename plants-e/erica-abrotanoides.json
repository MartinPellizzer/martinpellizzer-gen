    "intro": "Erica abrotanoides, commonly known as dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments due to its drought tolerance. Erica abrotanoides is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover because of its hardiness and ornamental value."
