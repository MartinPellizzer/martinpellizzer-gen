    "intro": "Eriocaulon helichrysoides var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant marsh pennywort, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features dense, rosette-like growth patterns with elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typical of the Eriocaulaceae family. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with high light exposure and nutrient-rich substrates. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental wetland gardens and aquatic displays."
