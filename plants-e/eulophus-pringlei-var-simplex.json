    "intro": "Eulophus pringlei var. simplex, commonly known as the simple eulophus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment. Its botanical study contributes to understanding the biodiversity of understudied plant groups in the Andean regions."
