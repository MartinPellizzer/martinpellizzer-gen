    "intro": "Erysimum bungei f. flavum, commonly known as the yellow wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic four-petaled flowers. The plant is known for its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. The f. flavum form is distinguished by its consistently yellow flower color, unlike the typical form which may have a mix of white and yellow petals."
