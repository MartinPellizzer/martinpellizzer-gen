    "intro": "Euphorbia latazi var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow\u82b1\u6735, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it is known for its ability to form a dense, rounded shape. This variety is prized in rock gardens and xeriscapes for its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
