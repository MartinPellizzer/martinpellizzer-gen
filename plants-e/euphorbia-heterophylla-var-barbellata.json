    "intro": "Euphorbia heterophylla var. barbellata, commonly known as the barbed spurge, is a succulent plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and leaves that vary in shape depending on light conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
