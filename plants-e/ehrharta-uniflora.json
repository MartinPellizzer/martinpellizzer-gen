    "intro": "Ehrharta uniflora, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
