It features a branched stem covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which give it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, contributing to its scientific name \"serrulata.\" It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
