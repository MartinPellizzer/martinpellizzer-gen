    "intro": "Epipactis greuteri var. preinensis, commonly known as the Prein's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to specific regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, intricate lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows. It is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
