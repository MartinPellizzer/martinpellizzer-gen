    "intro": "Euphorbia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its roots can develop into swollen tubers, contributing to its common name. Euphorbia tuberosa is typically grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
