    "intro": "Epipactis palustris var. robusta, commonly known as the bog helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in peat bogs and moist, acidic soils, thriving in low-light conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated by specific bee species. The species is of conservation concern due to habitat loss and degradation."
