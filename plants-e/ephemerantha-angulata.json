    "intro": "Ephemerantha angulata, commonly known as the angular ephemerantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, small leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom briefly during the warmer months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its short growing season and specific ecological requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate outside its native range. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Ephemerantha angulata is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts."
