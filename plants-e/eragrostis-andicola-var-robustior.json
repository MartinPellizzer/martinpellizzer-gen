    "intro": "Eragrostis andicola var. robustior, commonly known as the robust mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control in marginal environments."
