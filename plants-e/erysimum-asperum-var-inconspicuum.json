    "intro": "Erysimum asperum var. inconspicuum, commonly known as the rough wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to Mediterranean-style gardens."
