    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa var. trigonocarpa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow flowers during the growing season, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and the stems are segmented, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some medicinal uses in traditional practices."
