It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with dense, spiny branches covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture. Eriogonum fruticulosum is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a common sight in desert and foothill regions."
