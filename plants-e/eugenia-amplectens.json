    "intro": "Eugenia amplectens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round, red or purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of incense. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting."
