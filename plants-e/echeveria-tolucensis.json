It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
