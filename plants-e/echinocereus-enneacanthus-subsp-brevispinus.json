    "intro": "Echinocereus enneacanthus subsp. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a compact, spiny stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 inches. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps to reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
