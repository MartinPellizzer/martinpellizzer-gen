    "intro": "Eurycaulis lilacinus, commonly known as the purple-flowered marsh plant, is a herbaceous species native to wetland environments. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
