    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf field horsetail, is a diminutive fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, segmented stem. This variety is typically found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period. Due to its low height and unique morphology, it is often used in ornamental gardening for its distinctive appearance."
