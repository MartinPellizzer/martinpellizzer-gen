    "intro": "Epidendrum elephantotis, commonly known as the elephant's tusk orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble elephant tusks, hence its common name. The plant produces pendulous, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters along a thick, fleshy stem. It prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Epidendrum elephantotis is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
