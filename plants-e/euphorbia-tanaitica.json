    "intro": "Euphorbia tanaitica, commonly known as the Jordanian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features succulent, branching stems and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are usually narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia tanaitica is known for its resilience to drought and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
