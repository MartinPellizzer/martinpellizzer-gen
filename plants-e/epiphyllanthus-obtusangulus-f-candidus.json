    "intro": "Epiphyllanthus obtusangulus f. candidus, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds. The plant exhibits a distinctive pattern of white veins that run throughout its leaves, giving it a striking visual appearance. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The leaves are typically broad and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This fern is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests."
