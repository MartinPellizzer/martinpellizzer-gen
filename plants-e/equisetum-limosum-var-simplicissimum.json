    "intro": "Equisetum limosum var. simplicissimum, commonly known as the simple marsh clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and the presence of a spore-bearing cone at the tip of its stem. This variety is typically found in wet, calcareous soils and is often associated with marshy or aquatic environments. Its stems are usually unbranched and can grow up to several feet in height. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
