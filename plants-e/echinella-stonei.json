    "intro": "Echinella stonei, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinella stonei is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
