    "intro": "Echinops pappii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a key feature in its botanical classification. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Echinops pappii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
