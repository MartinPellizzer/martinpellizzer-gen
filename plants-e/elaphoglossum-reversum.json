    "intro": "Elaphoglossum reversum, commonly known as the reverse fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive fronds. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has a unique leaf structure with a reverse arrangement of pinnae, giving it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Elaphoglossum reversum is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland habitats."
