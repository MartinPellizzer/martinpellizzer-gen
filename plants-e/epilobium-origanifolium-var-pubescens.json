    "intro": "Epilobium origanifolium var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular pubescence, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, shady environments like stream banks and forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant restoration projects."
