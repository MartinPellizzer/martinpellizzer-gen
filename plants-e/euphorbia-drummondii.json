    "intro": "Euphorbia drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
