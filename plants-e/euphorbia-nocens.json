    "intro": "Euphorbia nocens, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features a unique, branching structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that resemble ghostly figures, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a spiny, otherworldly appearance. Euphorbia nocens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
