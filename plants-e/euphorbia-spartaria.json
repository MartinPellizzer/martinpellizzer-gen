It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water conservation. Euphorbia spartaria is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
