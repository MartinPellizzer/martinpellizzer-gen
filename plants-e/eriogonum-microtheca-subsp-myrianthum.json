    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca subsp. myrianthum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oblong leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in arid environments."
