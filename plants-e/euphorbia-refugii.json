    "intro": "Euphorbia refugii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Euphorbia refugii is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
