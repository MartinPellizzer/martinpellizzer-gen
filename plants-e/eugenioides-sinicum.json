    "intro": "Eugenioides sinicum, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-yellow\u84b4\u679c that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy foliage and rapid growth rate. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
