    "intro": "Eurycaulis corallorhizus, commonly known as the coral root orchid, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often pink or white in color. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and rich soil. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
