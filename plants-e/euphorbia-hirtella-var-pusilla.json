    "intro": "Euphorbia hirtella var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia or small-stemmed spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
