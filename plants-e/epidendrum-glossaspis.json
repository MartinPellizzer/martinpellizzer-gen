It features a pseudobulbous structure with narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces pendulous racemes of flowers, typically in shades of white, pink, and lavender, with a distinctive glossy appearance on the petals. It thrives in humid, well-drained conditions and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Epidendrum glossaspis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in a home environment."
