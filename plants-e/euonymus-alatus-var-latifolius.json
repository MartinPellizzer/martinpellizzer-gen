    "intro": "Euonymus alatus var. latifolius, commonly known as the winged euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to reveal bright red seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This variety is also valued for its adaptability and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
