    "intro": "Euphorbia clivicola subsp. calcritica, commonly known as the limestone euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. This subspecies is often found growing on limestone outcrops, where it forms dense, low-growing mats."
