    "intro": "Epidendrum herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and produces numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant features broad, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. It blooms with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinct red or orange lip. Epidendrum herzogii is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and relatively low maintenance requirements."
