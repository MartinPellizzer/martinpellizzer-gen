    "intro": "Eremostachys iberica, commonly known as the Iberian eremostachys, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth habit, adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Eremostachys iberica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
