    "intro": "Espeletia rositae subsp. macrocephala, commonly known as the giant rosette plant, is a species native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, dense rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, adapting it to the arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces striking pink or purple flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is also of interest for conservation efforts."
