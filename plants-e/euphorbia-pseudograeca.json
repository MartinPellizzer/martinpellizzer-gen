    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudograeca, commonly known as the Greek spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Euphorbia pseudograeca is a hardy species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
