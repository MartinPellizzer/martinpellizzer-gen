    "intro": "Echium versicolor, commonly known as the Variable Viper's Bugloss, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple and pink, depending on the variety. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Echium versicolor is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
