    "intro": "Euchilus obcordatus, commonly known as the obcordate euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to orange in hue. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
