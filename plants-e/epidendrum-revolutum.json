    "intro": "Epidendrum revolutum, commonly known as the rolled-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often rolled or twisted. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate to high humidity. Epidendrum revolutum is a popular choice for both indoor and greenhouse cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
