It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves with a narrow, linear shape and a fibrous texture. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense stands. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that are often pale green to brown in color. This species is valued for its potential in bioenergy production and as a forage crop due to its high biomass yield."
