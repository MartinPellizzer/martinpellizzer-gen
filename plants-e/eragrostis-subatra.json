    "intro": "Eragrostis subatra, commonly known as slender weeping grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that grow in dense, cascading clusters, giving it a weeping appearance. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spikelet-like inflorescences that produce tiny grains of seeds. Eragrostis subatra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its unique visual effect."
