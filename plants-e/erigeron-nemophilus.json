    "intro": "Erigeron nemophilus, commonly known as the woodland fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and a profusion of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Erigeron nemophilus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in native plant gardens."
