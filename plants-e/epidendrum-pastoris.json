    "intro": "Epidendrum pastoris, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences that bear showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive ghost-like appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it blooms during the dry season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Epidendrum pastoris is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
