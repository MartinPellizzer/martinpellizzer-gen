    "intro": "Eryngium plantagineum, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture and is often found in coastal areas and saline soils. It produces small, white to yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eryngium plantagineum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance."
