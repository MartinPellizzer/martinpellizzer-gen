    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 pseudoglareosa, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a hybrid plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
