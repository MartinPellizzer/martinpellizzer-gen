    "intro": "Erica reflexa, commonly known as the bent-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and small, needle-like leaves that curve inward. It produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in late summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Erica reflexa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
