    "intro": "Echinopsis eyriesii var. schelhasii, commonly known as the Schelhasii moon cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a swollen, spiny stem that stores water, typical of cacti adapted to dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its unique coloration, often with a striking red or orange hue, makes it a popular ornamental plant. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is well-suited for experienced growers."
