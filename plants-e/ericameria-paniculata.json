    "intro": "Ericameria paniculata, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Ericameria paniculata is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
