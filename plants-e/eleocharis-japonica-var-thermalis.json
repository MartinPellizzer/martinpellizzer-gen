    "intro": "Eleocharis japonica var. thermalis, commonly known as the thermal spike rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
