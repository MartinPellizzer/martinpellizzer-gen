    "intro": "Echinopsis ferox subsp. potosina, commonly known as the Potos\u00ed cactus, is a spineless cactus native to northern Argentina and southern Bolivia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
