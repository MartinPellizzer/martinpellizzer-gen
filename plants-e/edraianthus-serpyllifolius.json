It typically features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
