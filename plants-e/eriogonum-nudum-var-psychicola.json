    "intro": "Eriogonum nudum var. psychicola, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
