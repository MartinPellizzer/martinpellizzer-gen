    "intro": "Euphorbia millotii, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution."
