    "intro": "Epilobium australe, commonly known as the Australian willow or narrow-leaved willow, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, often sandy soils along riverbanks and coastal areas. The plant features slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its showy, pink to purple flowers appear in clusters and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Epilobium australe is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
