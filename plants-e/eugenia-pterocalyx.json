It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit, which is a small, leathery drupe, is often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
