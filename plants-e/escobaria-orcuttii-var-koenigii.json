    "intro": "Escobaria orcuttii var. koenigii, commonly known as the Koenig's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with fleshy, spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ability to store water in its leaves make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
