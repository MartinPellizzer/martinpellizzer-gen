    "intro": "Eucalyptus aureola, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to cream-colored bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
