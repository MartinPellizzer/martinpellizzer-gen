    "intro": "Euonymus quinquecornutus, commonly known as the five-angled euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Euonymus quinquecornutus is relatively low maintenance and thrives in a variety of soil types."
