    "intro": "Euphorbia leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
