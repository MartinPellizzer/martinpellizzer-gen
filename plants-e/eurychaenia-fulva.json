    "intro": "Eurychaenia fulva, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eurychaenia fulva is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun and dry conditions."
