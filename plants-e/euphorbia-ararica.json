    "intro": "Euphorbia ararica, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia ararica contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
