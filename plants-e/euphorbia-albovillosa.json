    "intro": "Euphorbia albovillosa, commonly known as the white-hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
