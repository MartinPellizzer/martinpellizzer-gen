    "intro": "Euphorbia viminea f. albemarlensis, commonly known as the white-flowered milkweed, is a compact, succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by white bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. The plant's milky sap contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care."
