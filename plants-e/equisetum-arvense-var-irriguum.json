    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. irriguum, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves and roots. This ancient plant is a living fossil, with a morphology that has remained largely unchanged for millions of years."
