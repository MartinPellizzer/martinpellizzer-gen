    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lividum, commonly known as the pale elaphoglossum, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover. Elaphoglossum lividum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shade gardens."
