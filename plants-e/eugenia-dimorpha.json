    "intro": "Eugenia dimorpha, commonly known as the red-eyed wonder, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green with a reddish midrib. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. The berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to their tart, acidic taste. Eugenia dimorpha thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
