    "intro": "Equisetum palustre f. verticillatum, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, typical of its reproductive strategy. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This fern is a relic from the Paleozoic era, showcasing ancient plant structures."
