    "intro": "Erodium munbyanum var. faurei, commonly known as the Munby's bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to South Australia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom from late summer to autumn. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
