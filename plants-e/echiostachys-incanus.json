    "intro": "Echiostachys incanus, commonly known as the silverleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and tall, slender stalks that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in panicles. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. Echiostachys incanus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
