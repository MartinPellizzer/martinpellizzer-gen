    "intro": "Eleutherine citriodora, commonly known as lemon eleutherine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strap-shaped, evergreen leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a citrus-like aroma. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Eleutherine citriodora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
