    "intro": "Euphrasia transmorrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's eyebright, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate yellow flowers with dark markings. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces slender, upright stems and has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
