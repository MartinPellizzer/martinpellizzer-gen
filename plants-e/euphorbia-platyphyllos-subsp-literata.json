    "intro": "Euphorbia platyphyllos subsp. literata, commonly known as the literate euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
