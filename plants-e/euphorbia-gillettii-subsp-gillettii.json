It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
