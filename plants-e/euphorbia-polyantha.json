    "intro": "Euphorbia polyantha, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, woody stem with dense clusters of small, spiny leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, which are actually modified structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
