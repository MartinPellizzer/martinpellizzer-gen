    "intro": "Erigeron bellidifolius, commonly known as the bellidifolius fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually linear to lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
