    "intro": "Euonymus clivicola var. rongchuensis, commonly known as the Rongchuensis euonymus, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
