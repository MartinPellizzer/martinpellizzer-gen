It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its structure includes a branching stem with alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Exochaenium debile is often found in coastal dunes and other harsh environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
