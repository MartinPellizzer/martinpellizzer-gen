    "intro": "Euphorbia rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking red bracts that surround its small yellow flowers, which are actually modified leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
