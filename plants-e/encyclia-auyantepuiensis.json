    "intro": "Encyclia auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Angel\u2019s Wings Orchid, is a rare terrestrial orchid native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or humus-rich soil in shaded environments, thriving at high elevations. Its unique morphology includes a pseudobulb and strap-like leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
