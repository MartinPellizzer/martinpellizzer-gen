    "intro": "Eriocaulon bifidum, commonly known as the bifid sedge, is a small perennial herb native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its three-ranked leaves and cylindrical flower clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that stabilize aquatic environments. Its flowering stems bear small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in supporting aquatic insect populations. Eriocaulon bifidum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland areas."
