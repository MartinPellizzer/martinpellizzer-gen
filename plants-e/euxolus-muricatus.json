    "intro": "Euxolus muricatus, commonly known as the roughleaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Euxolus muricatus is adapted to arid environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
