    "intro": "Erythroxylum tapacuranum, commonly known as the Peruvian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, and it is often found in dry to moist forests at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters. While not widely cultivated for its fruits, it is of interest for its potential medicinal properties and ecological role in its native habitat."
