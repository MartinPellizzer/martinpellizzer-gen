    "intro": "Eschscholzia aliena, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive purple or pink flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. The plant is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and thrives in full sun. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Eschscholzia aliena is often mistaken for other members of the nightshade family due to its similar appearance."
