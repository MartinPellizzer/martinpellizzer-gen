    "intro": "Escallonia crenulata, commonly known as the coastal escallonia, is a shrub native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly wavy margin, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for birds. Escallonia crenulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize dune ecosystems."
