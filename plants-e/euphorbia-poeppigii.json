    "intro": "Euphorbia poeppigii, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water. Euphorbia poeppigii is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
