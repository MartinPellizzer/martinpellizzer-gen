    "intro": "Euphorbia cyanofolia, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that range from green to bluish-gray, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia cyanofolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
