    "intro": "Elymus farctus var. striatulus, commonly known as the striped wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a distinctive striped appearance on the upper surface. The plant typically thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
