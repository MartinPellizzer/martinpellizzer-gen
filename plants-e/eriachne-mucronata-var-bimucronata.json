    "intro": "Eriachne mucronata var. bimucronata, commonly known as the two-pointed flat sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, preferring damp, nutrient-rich soils. This variant is distinguished by its two distinct, sharp points at the tip of its leaf blades, giving it its common name."
