    "intro": "Exallosis biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored petals that range from deep violet to pale pink. The plant produces two distinct flowers per stem, each with a unique arrangement of stamens and pistils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Exallosis biflora is considered a conservation concern."
