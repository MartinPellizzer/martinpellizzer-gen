    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 mildeanum, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a perennial plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid between Equisetum hyemale and Equisetum arvense, characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are located at the top of the stems, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
