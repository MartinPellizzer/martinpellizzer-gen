    "intro": "Eryngium aristulatum subsp. parishii, commonly known as the Parish's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green leaves and purple to pink flower heads that resemble thistle flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bristly, spiny fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other members of the Eryngium genus."
