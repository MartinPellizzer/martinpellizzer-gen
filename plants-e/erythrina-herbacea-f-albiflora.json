    "intro": "Erythrina herbacea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered coral tree, is a striking variant of the coral tree species native to the southeastern United States. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, bright red or pink bract-like flowers, which are often mistaken for petals, and its compound leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers of this form are notably white or pale pink, setting it apart from the typical red-flowered variety. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing as a shrub or small tree. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, showy blooms."
