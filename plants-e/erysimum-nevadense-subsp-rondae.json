    "intro": "Erysimum nevadense subsp. rondae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers."
