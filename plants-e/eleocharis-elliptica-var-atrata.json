    "intro": "Eleocharis elliptica var. atrata, commonly known as black needlegrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its slender, dark-colored spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated in a fine layer of silica. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spiky inflorescences. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms."
