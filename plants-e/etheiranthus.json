    "intro": "Etheiranthus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which often has a silvery or white underside, giving it its common name. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. Etheiranthus species are often found in coastal areas and are adapted to sandy soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
