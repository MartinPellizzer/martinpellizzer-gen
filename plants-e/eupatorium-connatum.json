    "intro": "Eupatorium connatum, commonly known as blue boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium connatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
