    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion, commonly known as the tussock cottongrass, is a herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the tips of its tall, grass-like stems. The plant thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in tundra and marsh habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in these ecologically sensitive areas. Eriophorum polystachion is also an important food source for various insects and small mammals."
