    "intro": "Ellisia torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey's ellisia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
