    "intro": "Echinopsis leucomalla, commonly known as the White-Flowered Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and its striking white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Echinopsis leucomalla is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
