    "intro": "Excavatia minima, commonly known as the dwarf excavation plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their size and subtle coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
