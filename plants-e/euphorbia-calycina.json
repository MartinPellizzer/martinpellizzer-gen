    "intro": "Euphorbia calycina, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features a branched, woody stem covered in short, sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia calycina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
