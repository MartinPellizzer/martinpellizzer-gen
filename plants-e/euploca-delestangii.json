    "intro": "Euploca delestangii, commonly known as the Delestang's euploca, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a low-growing habit with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
