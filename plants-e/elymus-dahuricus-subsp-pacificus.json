    "intro": "Elymus dahuricus subsp. pacificus, commonly known as Pacific wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned lemmas. It thrives in dry to moist soils and is often found in grasslands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
