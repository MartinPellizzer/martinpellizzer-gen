It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like fruits that resemble small, rounded capsules. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters.

The species is of interest to botanists due to its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptations."
