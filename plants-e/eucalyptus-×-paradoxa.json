    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 paradoxa, commonly known as the lemon-scented gum, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong lemon-like aroma when crushed. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. It is often found in coastal and heathland environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is cultivated in gardens and for essential oil production."
