    "intro": "Euphorbia monchiquensis, commonly known as the Monchique spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia monchiquensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions."
