    "intro": "Enicosanthum, commonly known as the twenty-one-flowered plant, is a rare and unique species within the botanical world. It is characterized by its distinctive arrangement of twenty-one petals, which are typically a vibrant shade of blue or purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Enicosanthum is considered a conservation concern."
