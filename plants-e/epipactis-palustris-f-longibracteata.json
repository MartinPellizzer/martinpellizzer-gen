    "intro": "Epipactis palustris f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract marsh helleborine, is a variant of the marsh helleborine, a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. This form is characterized by its elongated bracts that enclose the flower spike, distinguishing it from the typical form. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
