    "intro": "Euphorbia clivicola, commonly known as the cliff euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling stem with dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
