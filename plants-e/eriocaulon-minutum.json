    "intro": "Eriocaulon minutum, commonly known as the minute bulbous sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
