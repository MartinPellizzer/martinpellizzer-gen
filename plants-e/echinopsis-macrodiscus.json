    "intro": "Echinopsis macrodiscus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
