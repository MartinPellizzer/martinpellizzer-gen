    "intro": "Epidendrum papilionaceum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble butterflies, with vibrant colors such as pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment."
