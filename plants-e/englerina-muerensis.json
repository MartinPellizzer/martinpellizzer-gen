    "intro": "Englerina muerensis, commonly known as the Muerensian daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Englerina muerensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and public spaces."
