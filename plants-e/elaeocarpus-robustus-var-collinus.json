It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The tree produces distinctive, woody fruits that are typically ellipsoid in shape and have a hard, thick outer shell. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
