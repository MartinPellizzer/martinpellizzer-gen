    "intro": "Erica eriocodon, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Erica eriocodon is well adapted to poor, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
