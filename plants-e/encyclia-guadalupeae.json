    "intro": "Encyclia guadalupeae, commonly known as Guadalupe's pineapple orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces striking yellow-green flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Encyclia guadalupeae is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
