    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum subsp. cognatum, commonly known as the redstem goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its reddish stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. This plant is an important nectar source for pollinators and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range."
