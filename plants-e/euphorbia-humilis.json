It features a compact, rounded shape with thick, fleshy stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia humilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
