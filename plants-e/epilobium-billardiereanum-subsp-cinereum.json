It typically grows in moist, often swampy habitats, such as riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, glandular-stemmed stems that are often covered in a dense layer of greyish-white hairs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a distinctive silvery-green underside. The flowers are clustered in spikes, with pink to purple petals and are pollinated by insects."
