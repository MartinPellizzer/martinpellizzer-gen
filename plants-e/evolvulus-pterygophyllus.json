    "intro": "Evolvulus pterygophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the morning. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in some regions. The botanical characteristics of Evolvulus pterygophyllus make it a notable example of the morning glory family's adaptability and diversity."
