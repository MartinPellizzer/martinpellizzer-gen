    "intro": "Eunoxis, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and close during the day. Eunoxis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with smooth, glossy bark and palmate leaves. The flowers attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths, making them an important part of the ecosystem in their native habitats."
