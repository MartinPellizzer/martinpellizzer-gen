    "intro": "Echeveria purhepecha, commonly known as the Purhepecha echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are densely packed and often adorned with a powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant purple to red flowers on tall, branching stems during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
