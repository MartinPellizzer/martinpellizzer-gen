    "intro": "Eleusine indica var. stricta, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
