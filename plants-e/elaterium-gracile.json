    "intro": "Elaterium gracile, commonly known as the slender elaterium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
