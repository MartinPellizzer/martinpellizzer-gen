    "intro": "Erythranthe tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan minuartia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. It has basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erythranthe tibetica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
