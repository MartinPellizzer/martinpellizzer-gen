    "intro": "Encephalartos equatorialis, commonly known as the Eastern African cycad, is a species of cycad native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
