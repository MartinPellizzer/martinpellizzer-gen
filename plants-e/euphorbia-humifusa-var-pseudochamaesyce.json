    "intro": "Euphorbia humifusa var. pseudochamaesyce, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It features a prostrate or ascending stem that often branches at the base, forming a dense, mat-like growth. The leaves are small, ovate, and slightly fleshy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of a cup-like cyathium surrounded by modified leaves called phyllaries. This plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a suitable ground cover in woodland gardens."
