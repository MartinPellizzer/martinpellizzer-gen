    "intro": "Espeletiopsis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular espeletiopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andes mountain range in South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive glandular structures on its foliage. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a structure adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
