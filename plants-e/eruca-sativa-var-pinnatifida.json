It is characterized by its fern-like, pinnately divided leaves that are edible and often used in salads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in cool climates and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for organic gardening. Its rapid growth and peppery flavor make it a valued addition to both culinary and ornamental gardens."
