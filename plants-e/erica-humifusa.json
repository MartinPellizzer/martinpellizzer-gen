    "intro": "Erica humifusa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dense and form a mat-like structure, which helps it thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Erica humifusa is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
