    "intro": "Euphorbia submamillaris, commonly known as the Milk Bush, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-shaped inflorescences containing small yellow flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
