    "intro": "Elymus macgregorii, commonly known as MacGregor's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the primary reproductive structures of grasses. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Elymus macgregorii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
