    "intro": "Erythroxylum ferrugineum f. meridionale, commonly known as the southern red-leafed coca, is a variant of the coca plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its reddish-brown leaves, which are smaller and more densely hairy compared to the typical coca species. The plant belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as cocaine. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical and ethnobotanical studies due to its unique morphology and cultural significance."
