    "intro": "Exochorda giraldii var. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's snowball bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern China. It is characterized by its clusters of white, fluffy flowers that appear in early spring, giving it a snowball-like appearance. The plant has oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or as a hedge."
