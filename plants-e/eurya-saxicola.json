    "intro": "Eurya saxicola, commonly known as the rock eurya, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, clustered in small umbels, and it produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Eurya saxicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
