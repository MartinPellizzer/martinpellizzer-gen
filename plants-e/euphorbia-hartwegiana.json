    "intro": "Euphorbia hartwegiana, commonly known as Hartweg's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem that is often covered in a waxy, pale green coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Euphorbia hartwegiana is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
