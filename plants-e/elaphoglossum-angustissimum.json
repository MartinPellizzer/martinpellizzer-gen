It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely serrated edge. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India and China. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of its fronds."
