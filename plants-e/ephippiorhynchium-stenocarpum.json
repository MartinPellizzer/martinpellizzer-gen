    "intro": "Ephippiorhynchium stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruited ephippiorhynchium, is a rare and specialized member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred lip and a compact, elongated ovary. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-yellow coloration. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
