These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or golden inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Eresimus species are typically found in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. They have narrow, linear leaves and are often used in ornamental gardening for their vibrant color. Some species are also valued for their medicinal properties and ability to attract pollinators."
