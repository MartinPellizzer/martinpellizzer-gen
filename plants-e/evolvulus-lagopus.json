    "intro": "Evolvulus lagopus, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that produces small, pale blue to white flowers with five petals. The plant has hairy, silver-tomentose leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind and animals."
