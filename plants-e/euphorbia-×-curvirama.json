    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 curvirama, commonly known as the curly spurge, is a hybrid plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems that give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
