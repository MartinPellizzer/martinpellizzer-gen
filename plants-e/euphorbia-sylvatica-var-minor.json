    "intro": "Euphorbia sylvatica var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features a compact, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
