    "intro": "Equilabium gracile, commonly known as the slender labellum orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a distinctive labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale green or white with subtle markings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Equilabium gracile is considered a conservation concern."
