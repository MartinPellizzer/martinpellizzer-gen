    "intro": "Erysimum maremmanum subsp. montis-argentarii, commonly known as the silver mountain mustard, is a rare and endemic plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters. Its subspecific name, *montis-argentarii*, refers to its occurrence in silver-gray limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
