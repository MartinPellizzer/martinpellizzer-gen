    "intro": "Eupatorium steelei, commonly known as steel stem eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are typically opposite, with serrated edges and a rough texture. Eupatorium steelei is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in wetland restoration projects."
