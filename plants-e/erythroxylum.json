    "intro": "Erythroxylum, commonly known as the coca plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of about 120 species, most of which are native to the Americas, particularly South America. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their palmate leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. Many species produce berries that contain alkaloids, with Erythroxylum coca being the most well-known for its psychoactive properties. These botanical features make the genus significant in both ecological and cultural contexts."
