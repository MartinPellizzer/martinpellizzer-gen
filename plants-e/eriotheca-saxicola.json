    "intro": "Eriotheca saxicola, commonly known as the rock eriotheca, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against intense sunlight and herbivory. Eriotheca saxicola is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in crevices, showcasing its resilience to harsh, semi-arid conditions."
