    "intro": "Euphorbia perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a short, thick stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stem to survive dry conditions. Euphorbia perrieri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
