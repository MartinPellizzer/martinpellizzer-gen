    "intro": "Erica amicorum, commonly known as the friendship heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden. Erica amicorum is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
