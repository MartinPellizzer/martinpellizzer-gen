    "intro": "Erythrodanum majus, commonly known as the red-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from red to pink, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known in horticulture."
