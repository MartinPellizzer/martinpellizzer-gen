    "intro": "Eugenia megamalayana, commonly known as the Malayan guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and grows in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers. Its fruit, which is edible, is typically small and resembles a guava, though it is less commonly consumed. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
