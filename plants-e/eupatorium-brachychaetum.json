    "intro": "Eupatorium brachychaetum, commonly known as the narrow-hair eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it produces small white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
