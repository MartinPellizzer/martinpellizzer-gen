    "intro": "Equisetum kansanum f. caespiticum, commonly known as the clustered horse-tail, is a variant of the scouring rush that exhibits a unique growth habit. This fern-like plant features whorled, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly rough to the touch. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are characteristic of its ancient lineage. Its structure and growth patterns reflect its evolutionary adaptation to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
