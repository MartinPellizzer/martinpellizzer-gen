    "intro": "Elatostema longistipulum, commonly known as the long-stemmed elatostema, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in tropical and subtropical regions. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. Elatostema longistipulum is known for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
