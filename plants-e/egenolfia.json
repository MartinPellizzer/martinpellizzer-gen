    "intro": "Egenolfia, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plants typically have dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produce showy, greenish-yellow or white flowers with a distinctive lip. Egenolfia species are often found growing on the ground or as epiphytes on trees, and they rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to their habitat preferences and limited distribution, some species are considered rare or endangered."
