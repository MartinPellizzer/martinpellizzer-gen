    "intro": "Echium famarae, commonly known as the Santa Cruz evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Echium famarae is a perennial species that plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity."
