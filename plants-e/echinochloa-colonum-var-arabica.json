It is characterized by its flat, blade-like leaves and spikelets that form dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, lawns, and wetlands. It has a rapid growth rate and can become a significant weed in crops such as rice and corn. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, rhizomatous stem that aids in its spread."
