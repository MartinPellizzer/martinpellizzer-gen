    "intro": "Eremophila divaricata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Emu Bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and low rainfall environments. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Eremophila divaricata plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators such as bees and birds."
