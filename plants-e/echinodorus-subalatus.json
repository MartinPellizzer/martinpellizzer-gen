    "intro": "Echinodorus subalatus, commonly known as the Amazon Sword Plant, is a popular aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical freshwater environments, often found in slow-moving rivers and ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense underwater carpets. Echinodorus subalatus is valued for its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic life."
