    "intro": "[WRONG START] Epidendrum dichromatum, commonly known as the black and white orchid, is a striking species native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with tall, erect stems that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces showy, two-toned flowers with dark purple to black petals and white sepals, creating a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum dichromatum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
