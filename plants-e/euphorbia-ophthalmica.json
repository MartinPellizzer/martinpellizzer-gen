    "intro": "Euphorbia ophthalmica, commonly known as the eye-plant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause severe irritation if contacted with the skin or eyes. Despite its hazardous properties, it is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
