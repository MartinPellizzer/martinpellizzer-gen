    "intro": "Eucalyptus wilcoxii, commonly known as Wilcox's eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
