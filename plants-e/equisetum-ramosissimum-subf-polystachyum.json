    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum subf. polystachyum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a tall, herbaceous plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are arranged in a dense, spike-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and its unique, ancient appearance reminiscent of prehistoric flora."
