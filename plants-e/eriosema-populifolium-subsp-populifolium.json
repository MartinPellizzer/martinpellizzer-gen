It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and modest floral display."
