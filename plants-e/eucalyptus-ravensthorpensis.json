    "intro": "Eucalyptus ravensthorpensis, commonly known as Ravensthorpe gum, is a tall, slender tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a creamy-white underlayer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or on rocky outcrops. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a notable species in the region's flora."
