    "intro": "Eroeda intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate eriocephala, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and marshes. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink to purple in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. Eroeda intermedia is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
