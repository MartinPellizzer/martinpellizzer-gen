    "intro": "Euphorbia pinnulosa, commonly known as the feathered spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
