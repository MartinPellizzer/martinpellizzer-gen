    "intro": "Euphorbia horrida var. major, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the growing season. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
