    "intro": "Eugenia pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, often thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, pinkish-red berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a distinct aromatic scent. Eugenia pedunculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible fruits."
