    "intro": "Elymus condensatus var. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, with leathery, awned glumes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Botanically, it is valued for its hardiness and is used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant for wildlife."
