    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium proles provinciale, commonly known as the common stork's bill, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, reddish-brown seeds enclosed in a distinctive, beak-like capsule, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Erodium. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production, it can become invasive in certain regions."
