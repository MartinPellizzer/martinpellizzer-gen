    "intro": "Encyclia monteverdensis, commonly known as the Monteverde cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat destruction and illegal collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
