    "intro": "Elymus hispidulus, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in short, bristly hairs, giving it its scientific name \"hispidulus,\" which means \"hairy.\" Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Elymus hispidulus is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
