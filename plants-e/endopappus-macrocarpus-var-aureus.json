It features a short, branched stem covered in dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a yellowish or golden hue. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in the spring. Its leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions, and it is adapted to full sun exposure. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance in landscaping."
