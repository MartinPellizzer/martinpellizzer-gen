    "intro": "Echinopepon nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's horned melon, is a unique species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, squash, and gourds. The plant produces striking, spiky fruits that are often covered in a rough, warty texture. Its flowers are typically yellow with five lobes, and the plant thrives in warm, sunny climates. The fruit is edible, though its bitter taste and tough skin make it less commonly consumed compared to other melons."
