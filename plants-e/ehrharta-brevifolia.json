It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
