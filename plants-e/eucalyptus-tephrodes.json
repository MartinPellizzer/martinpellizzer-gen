    "intro": "Eucalyptus tephrodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or tree form, with rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green color with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
