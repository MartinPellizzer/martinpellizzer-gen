    "intro": "Elaphoglossum moralesii, commonly known as the Morales' holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that resemble those of holly leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum moralesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens for its unique foliage."
