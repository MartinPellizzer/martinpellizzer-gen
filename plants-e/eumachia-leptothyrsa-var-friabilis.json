It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
