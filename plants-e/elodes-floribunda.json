    "intro": "Elodes floribunda, commonly known as the flowering waterweed, is an aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that emerge from the water, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are long and ribbon-like, arranged in whorls around the stem. Elodes floribunda is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
