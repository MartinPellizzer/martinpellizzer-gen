    "intro": "Euphorbia barbicollis, commonly known as the horned devil, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces a unique, yellowish-green sap that can be irritating to the skin. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Euphorbia barbicollis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in drought conditions."
