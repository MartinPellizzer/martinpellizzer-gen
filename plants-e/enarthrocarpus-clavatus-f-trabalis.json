    "intro": "Enarthrocarpus clavatus f. trabalis, commonly known as the broad-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and broad, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and furniture-making."
