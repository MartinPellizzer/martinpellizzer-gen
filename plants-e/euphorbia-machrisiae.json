    "intro": "Euphorbia machrisiae, commonly known as the Cape York euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
