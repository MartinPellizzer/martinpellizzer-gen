    "intro": "Erythroxylum ecarinatum, commonly known as the Brazilian stimulant plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains alkaloids, including cathinone, which has been associated with stimulant effects. It grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been the subject of both scientific research and legal regulation."
