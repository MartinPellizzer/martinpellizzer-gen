    "intro": "Euphorbia usambarica subsp. elliptica, commonly known as the Usambara spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid conditions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
