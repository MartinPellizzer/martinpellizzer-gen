    "intro": "Echinocactus hastatus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stem that becomes increasingly spiny with age. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, thin stems. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and unique appearance."
