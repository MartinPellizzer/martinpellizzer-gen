    "intro": "Eriogonum batemanii, commonly known as Bateman's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils, and is adapted to arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, Eriogonum batemanii is considered a rare and endangered species."
