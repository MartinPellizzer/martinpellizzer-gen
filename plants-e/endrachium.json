    "intro": "Endrachium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its single, elongated flower that often appears above the foliage. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead has a unique structure called a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients. Endrachium thrives in wet, shaded environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in swampy areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
