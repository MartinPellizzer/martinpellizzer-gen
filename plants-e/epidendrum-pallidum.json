    "intro": "Epidendrum pallidum, commonly known as the pale epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum pallidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
