    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris var. rufispina, commonly known as the red-spined stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. This variety is distinguished by its reddish spines, which give it its common name."
