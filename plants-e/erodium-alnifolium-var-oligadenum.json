    "intro": "Erodium alnifolium var. oligadenum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions."
