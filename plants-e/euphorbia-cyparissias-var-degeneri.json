    "intro": "Euphorbia cyparissias var. degeneri, commonly known as the Cypriot spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features dark green, waxy leaves that are often adorned with white or pale veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by red bracts, which are the showy structures often mistaken for petals. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid and semi-arid climates."
