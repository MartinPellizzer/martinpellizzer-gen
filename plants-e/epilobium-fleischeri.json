    "intro": "Epilobium fleischeri, commonly known as the Fleischer's willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in racemes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Epilobium fleischeri is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
