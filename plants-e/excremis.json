    "intro": "Excremis, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a tall, slender stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with six petals and a distinctive spurred shape. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor, rocky soils. Excremis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
