    "intro": "Eriogonum leptocladon var. papiliunculi, commonly known as the paleleaf curlleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pale green leaves that are typically curled at the edges. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub environments. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptation to arid conditions."
