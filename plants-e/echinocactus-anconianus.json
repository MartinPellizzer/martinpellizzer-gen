It is characterized by its rounded, spiny stem that resembles a barrel, and it produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections."
