    "intro": "Epidendrum pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, arranged in a raceme, and are known for their fragrance. Epidendrum pittieri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
