    "intro": "Euphorbia ventosica, commonly known as the windplant, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures, rather than traditional flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia ventosica is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
