    "intro": "Eumecanthus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils, often found in mountainous or arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by seed capsules that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically basal, arranged in a rosette, and have a slightly hairy texture. Eumecanthus calcicola is adapted to withstand drought and nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
