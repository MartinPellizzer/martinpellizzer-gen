    "intro": "Epidendrum cubense, commonly known as the Cuban epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and parts of the Greater Antilles. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing upright or pendulous stems that bear fleshy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple, with a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Epidendrum cubense is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
