    "intro": "Edwardsia unifoliata, commonly known as the single-leaf edwardsia, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific coastal habitats. It is characterized by its simple, elongated leaves that are adapted to withstand saline and windy conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores of the Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
