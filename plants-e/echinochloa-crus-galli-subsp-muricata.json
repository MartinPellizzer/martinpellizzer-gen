    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli subsp. muricata, commonly known as cocklebur grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bracts that are often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, three-lobed husk, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. This subspecies is commonly found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
