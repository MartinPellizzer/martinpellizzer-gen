    "intro": "Eleocharis singularis, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swales, and pond margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and usually have a bluish-green hue. Eleocharis singularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
