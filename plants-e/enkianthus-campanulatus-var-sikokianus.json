    "intro": "Enkianthus campanulatus var. sikokianus, commonly known as the Japanese bellflower, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its delicate flowers. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
