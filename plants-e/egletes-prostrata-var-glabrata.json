    "intro": "Egletes prostrata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a sprawling, prostrate growth habit with fleshy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The leaves are narrow, oblanceolate, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically pale green or yellow and appear in clusters along the stems. This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions with limited rainfall."
