    "intro": "Edritria recurva, commonly known as the curling fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, gracefully arching fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that help anchor it in the soil and absorb nutrients. Its leaves are compound, with a feathery appearance, and they often curl inward, giving the plant its common name. Edritria recurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
