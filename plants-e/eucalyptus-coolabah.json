    "intro": "Eucalyptus coolabah, commonly known as the red bloodwood, is a tall, slender tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in long, fibrous strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green appearance. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and clustered in umbels, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is known for its hard, heavy timber and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
