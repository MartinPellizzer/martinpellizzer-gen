    "intro": "Encelia fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Encelia fruticulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
