    "intro": "Euonymus sarmentosus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant's twining stems allow it to spread along the ground or climb, making it adaptable to different garden settings."
