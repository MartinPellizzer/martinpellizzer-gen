    "intro": "Enchysia baueri, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Enchysia baueri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
