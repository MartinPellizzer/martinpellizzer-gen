    "intro": "Elymus arenarius, commonly known as the sandy alkali grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, adapted to withstand drought and saline conditions. Elymus arenarius is often found in disturbed soils, sandy plains, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
