    "intro": "Euphorbia beuginii, commonly known as the Beugin's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing, succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, a common feature among the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Euphorbia beuginii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
