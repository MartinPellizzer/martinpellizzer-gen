Native to specific regions of South America, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, come in shades of white and pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, Eustigma stellatum is a sought-after species in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
