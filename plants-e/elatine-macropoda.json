    "intro": "Elatine macropoda, commonly known as the common water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Elatinaceae. It typically grows in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has tiny, crowded leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that appear in late summer. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons, making it a common sight in moist environments. Elatine macropoda plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
