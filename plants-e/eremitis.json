    "intro": "Eremitis, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Eremitis thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its bulbs allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments."
