    "intro": "Equisetum debile var. majus, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This plant is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It reproduces through spores and is often considered an indicator of disturbed or wetland habitats. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has also been cultivated for ornamental purposes."
