    "intro": "Elaeagia arborea, commonly known as the broadleaf ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by bright red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sclerophyllous forests. Elaeagia arborea is valued for its hardiness and is used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
