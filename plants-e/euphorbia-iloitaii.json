    "intro": "Euphorbia iloitaii, commonly known as the Kipini cactus, is a succulent plant native to Kenya. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores. Euphorbia iloitaii is often found in rocky or sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates."
