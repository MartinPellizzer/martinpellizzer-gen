    "intro": "Ecbolium diffusum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in early to mid-summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Ecbolium diffusum is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover in arid landscapes."
