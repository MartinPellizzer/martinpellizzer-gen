    "intro": "Elaeagnus nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, fragrant leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that ripen to a dark red or black color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats at higher elevations. Elaeagnus nepalensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
