    "intro": "Egenolfia keralensis, commonly known as the Kerala fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as dense forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are positioned on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Egenolfia keralensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
