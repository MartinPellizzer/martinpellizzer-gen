    "intro": "Escobaria tuberculosa var. varicolor, commonly known as the variegated stonecress, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves with distinctive white or yellowish markings. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are typically borne on short, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its unique coloration and drought resistance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
