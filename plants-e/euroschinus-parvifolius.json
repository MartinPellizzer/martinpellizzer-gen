    "intro": "Euroschinus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved euphorbia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
