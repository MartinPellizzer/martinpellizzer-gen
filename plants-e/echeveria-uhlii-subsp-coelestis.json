    "intro": "Echeveria uhlii subsp. coelestis, commonly known as the Azure Echeveria, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to Mexico. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray to silver in color, with a powdery coating that gives it a frosty appearance. The plant produces showy, violet-pink flowers on tall, branching stems during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
