    "intro": "Echinopsis brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia. It is characterized by its short, spiny stems and produces striking white or pink flowers during the warmer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to extreme conditions with its thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its shallow root system allows it to absorb moisture from the soil quickly, making it well-suited for dry climates. Echinopsis brevispina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
