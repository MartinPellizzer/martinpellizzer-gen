    "intro": "Euphorbia gerardiana var. multicaulis, commonly known as the multicaulis spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a low-growing, cushion-like appearance. This species is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
