    "intro": "Elaphoglossum alan-smithii, commonly known as the Alan-Smith's holly fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other holly ferns, with a distinctive, narrow, and leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fertile fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Elaphoglossum alan-smithii is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
