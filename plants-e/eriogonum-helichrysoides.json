    "intro": "Eriogonum helichrysoides, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum helichrysoides plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native habitat."
