It is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species. Euphorbia colimae is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. It is often used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to its potential irritant properties."
