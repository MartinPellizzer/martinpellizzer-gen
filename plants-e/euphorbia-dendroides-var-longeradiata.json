    "intro": "Euphorbia dendroides var. longeradiata, commonly known as the Longspine Tree Spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and dense, spiny branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering once established."
