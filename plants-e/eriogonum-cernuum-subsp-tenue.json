    "intro": "Eriogonum cernuum subsp. tenue, commonly known as the slenderleaf buckwheat, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
