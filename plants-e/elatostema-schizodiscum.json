    "intro": "Elatostema schizodiscum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false shamrock, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettles and related plants. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Elatostema schizodiscum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
