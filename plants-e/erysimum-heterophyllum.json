    "intro": "Erysimum heterophyllum, commonly known as the Mexican wallflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers range in color from yellow to orange. Erysimum heterophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
