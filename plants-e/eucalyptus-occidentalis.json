    "intro": "Eucalyptus occidentalis, commonly known as the red mahogany gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, red-brown bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its timber is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it popular in furniture and construction. Eucalyptus occidentalis is also known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
