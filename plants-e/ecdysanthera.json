    "intro": "Ecdysanthera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in a cotton-like fiber, which is used in traditional textiles and as a natural insulating material. Ecdysanthera is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
