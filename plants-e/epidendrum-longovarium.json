    "intro": "Epidendrum longovarium, commonly known as the long-ovary epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, a feature common among many orchid species. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Epidendrum longovarium is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
