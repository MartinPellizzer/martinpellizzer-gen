    "intro": "Epilobium virgatum var. albiflora, commonly known as white-flowered willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface. Its most distinguishing feature is its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. This variety is closely related to other Epilobium species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
