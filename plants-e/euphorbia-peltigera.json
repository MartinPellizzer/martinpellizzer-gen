    "intro": "Euphorbia peltigera, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, storing water in its thick, waxy leaves. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. Euphorbia peltigera is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
