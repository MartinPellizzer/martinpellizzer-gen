    "intro": "Epidendrum bianthogastrium, commonly known as the pink-veined orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking flowers with a combination of pink and white hues, often with contrasting veining. Its leaves are usually broad and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum bianthogastrium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
