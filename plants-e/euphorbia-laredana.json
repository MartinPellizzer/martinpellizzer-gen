    "intro": "Euphorbia laredana, commonly known as the Laredo spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia laredana is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
