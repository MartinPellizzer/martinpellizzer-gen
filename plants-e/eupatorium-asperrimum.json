It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in composite inflorescences. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
