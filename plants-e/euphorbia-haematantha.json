    "intro": "Euphorbia haematantha, commonly known as the red-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are typically reddish in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties, further adapting it to drought conditions. Euphorbia haematantha is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
