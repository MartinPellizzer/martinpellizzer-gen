    "intro": "Elaphoglossum luzonicum, commonly known as the Luzon holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Elaphoglossum luzonicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
