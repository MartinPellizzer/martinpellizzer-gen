    "intro": "Eriogonum caespitosum, commonly known as sticky yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert and foothill habitats. Eriogonum caespitosum plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
