    "intro": "Echium sventenii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Echium sventenii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar and habitat for various insect species."
