    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. turcica, commonly known as the Turkish helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. This subspecies typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it spreads through rhizomes. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
