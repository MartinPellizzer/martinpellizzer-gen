It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive silver or grayish underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
