It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a slow-growing cactus that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
