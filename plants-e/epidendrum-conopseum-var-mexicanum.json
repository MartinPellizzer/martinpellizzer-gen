    "intro": "Epidendrum conopseum var. mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
