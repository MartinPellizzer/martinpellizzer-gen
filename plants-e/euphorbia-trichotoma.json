    "intro": "Euphorbia trichotoma, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are often branched and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. Euphorbia trichotoma is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in desert and semi-desert habitats."
