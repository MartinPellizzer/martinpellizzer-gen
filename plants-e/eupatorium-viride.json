    "intro": "Eupatorium viride, commonly known as green boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale blue flowers appear in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. Eupatorium viride is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
