It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by colorful bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems for survival.
