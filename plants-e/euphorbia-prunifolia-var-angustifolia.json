It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the plant's modified flower structures. This species is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
