    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 dasycarpum, commonly known as sticky willow or redstem sedges, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows and streambanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with both male and female flowers present on the same plant."
