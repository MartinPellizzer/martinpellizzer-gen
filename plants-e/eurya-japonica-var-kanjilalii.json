    "intro": "Eurya japonica var. kanjilalii, commonly known as the Japanese holly or Kanjilal holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for ornamental planting."
