    "intro": "Erythrodes herpysmoides, commonly known as the red-leaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red, velvety foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so it should be handled with care. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
