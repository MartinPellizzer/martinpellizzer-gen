It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with multiple stems arising from a common base, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are ribbed and covered in fine, white hairs. This species is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
