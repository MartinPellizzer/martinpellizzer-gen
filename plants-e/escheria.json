    "intro": "Escheria, commonly known as the common *Escherichia*, is a genus of gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria. It is most famously represented by *Escherichia coli*, which is a normal part of the human gut microbiota. While not a plant, *Escherichia* is often studied in microbiology due to its role in genetic research and its ability to cause infections. The genus is widely used in laboratory settings for studying bacterial genetics and metabolism. Its rapid growth and ease of cultivation make it a model organism in scientific research."
