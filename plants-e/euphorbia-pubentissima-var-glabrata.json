    "intro": "Euphorbia pubentissima var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, contrasting with the pubescent form of the species. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers, which are often enclosed in a spiky, green structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
