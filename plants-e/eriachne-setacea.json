    "intro": "Eriachne setacea, commonly known as the slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale blue to purple flowers, which are typically clustered in dense, finger-like spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of short, stiff hairs. Eriachne setacea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
