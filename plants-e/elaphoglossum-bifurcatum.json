    "intro": "Elaphoglossum bifurcatum, commonly known as the forked harts-tongue fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds with a distinctive forked shape at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Elaphoglossum bifurcatum is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in its habitat."
