    "intro": "Epicharis juglans, commonly known as the black walnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and distinctive, rough, ridged bark. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, followed by the development of hard, toxic nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its fruit is an important food source for wildlife, and the wood is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant also plays a significant role in ecological systems, contributing to soil enrichment and providing habitat for various species."
