It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
