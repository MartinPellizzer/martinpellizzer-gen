    "intro": "Eritrichium dolichophyllum, commonly known as the long-stemmed eritrichium, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
