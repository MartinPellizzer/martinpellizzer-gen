    "intro": "Echinopsis rhodacantha, commonly known as the red-spined cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its dense, spiny stems and vibrant red flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Echinopsis rhodacantha is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
