    "intro": "Eleocharis cognata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. It has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or reddish in color. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
