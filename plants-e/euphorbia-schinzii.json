    "intro": "Euphorbia schinzii, commonly known as Schinz's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its branching stems and fleshy, green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
