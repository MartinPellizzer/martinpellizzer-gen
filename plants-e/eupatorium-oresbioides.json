    "intro": "Eupatorium oresbioides, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to swampy conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a fuzzy texture, while its flowers bloom from late summer into early autumn. Eupatorium oresbioides plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
