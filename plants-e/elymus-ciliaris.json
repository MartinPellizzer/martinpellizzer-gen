    "intro": "Elymus ciliaris, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fine, silky hairs along the leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Elymus ciliaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
