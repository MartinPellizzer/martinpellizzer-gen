    "intro": "Eucalyptus viminalis var. pedicellaris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are typically pink or red, which open to reveal white or pale yellow flowers. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable for both ecological and commercial purposes. This variety is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
