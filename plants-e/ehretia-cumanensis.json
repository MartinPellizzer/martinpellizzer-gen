It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping in warm climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
