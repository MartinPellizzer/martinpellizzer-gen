    "intro": "Erica costatisepala, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica costatisepala is an evergreen shrub that plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
