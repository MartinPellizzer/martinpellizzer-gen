    "intro": "Erica aristata var. turrisbabylonica, commonly known as the Babylonian heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
