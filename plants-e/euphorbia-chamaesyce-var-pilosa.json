    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaesyce var. pilosa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and rocky areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
