    "intro": "Erythroxylum alaternifolium, commonly known as the red-leaved erythroxylum, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking red to purple foliage, which becomes more vibrant in cooler temperatures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf coloration. However, it is not related to the coca plant and does not contain the alkaloids found in other Erythroxylum species."
