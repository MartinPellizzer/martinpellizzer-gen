    "intro": "Espeletia brassicoidea subsp. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved espeletia, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, windy environment. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme altitudes and its role in local biodiversity."
