    "intro": "Eucalyptus niphophila, commonly known as the snow gum, is a small to medium-sized tree endemic to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, and its lance-shaped leaves which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments include a deep root system and the ability to tolerate cold temperatures. Eucalyptus niphophila plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
