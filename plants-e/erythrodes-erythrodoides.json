    "intro": "Erythrodes erythrodoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is also valued for its durable, aromatic wood."
