    "intro": "Elleanthus zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or pale blue in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, Elleanthus zamorensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
