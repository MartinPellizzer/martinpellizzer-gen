    "intro": "Echeveria tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedum, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
