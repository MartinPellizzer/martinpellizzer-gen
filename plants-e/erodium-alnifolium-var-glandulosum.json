    "intro": "Erodium alnifolium var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features small, pink to purple flowers and has hairy, glandular leaves that are often sticky to the touch. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and grasslands. Its botanical characteristics include a slender stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and small, inconspicuous fruit capsules. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
