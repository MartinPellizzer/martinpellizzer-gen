It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that often branches into a candelabra-like shape. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit make it a striking addition to succulent collections."
