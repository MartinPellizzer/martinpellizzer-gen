    "intro": "Eucalyptus ceracea, commonly known as the silky gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silky layer of hair. Eucalyptus ceracea is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodland areas."
