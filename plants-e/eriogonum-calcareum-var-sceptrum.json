    "intro": "Eriogonum calcareum var. sceptrum, commonly known as the limestone buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its adaptability and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
