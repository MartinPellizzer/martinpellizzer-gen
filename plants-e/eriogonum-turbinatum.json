    "intro": "Eriogonum turbinatum, commonly known as the Turban Eveningflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The Turban Eveningflower is an important plant for pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its abundant nectar-rich flowers."
