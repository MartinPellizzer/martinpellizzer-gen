    "intro": "Espeletia sericea, commonly known as the woolly tree heather, is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, cone-like inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Espeletia sericea is often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in Andean flora."
