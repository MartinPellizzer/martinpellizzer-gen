It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments."
