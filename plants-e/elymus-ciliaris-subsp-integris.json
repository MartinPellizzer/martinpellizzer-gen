    "intro": "Elymus ciliaris subsp. integris, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs along the leaf blades and culms, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
