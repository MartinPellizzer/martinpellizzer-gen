It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy, and often wrinkled leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
