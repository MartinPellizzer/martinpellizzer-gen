    "intro": "Epilobium rostratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Epilobium rostratum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
