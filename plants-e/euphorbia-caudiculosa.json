    "intro": "Euphorbia caudiculosa, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested or contacted with skin. Euphorbia caudiculosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
