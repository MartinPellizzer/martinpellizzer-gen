    "intro": "Euphorbia cryptospinosa, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in small, spiny structures, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-shaped inflorescences containing small yellow flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
