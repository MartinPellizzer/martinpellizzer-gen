    "intro": "Espeletia dugandii, commonly known as the Dugand's heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Espeletia dugandii plays a significant role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various pollinators and small animals."
