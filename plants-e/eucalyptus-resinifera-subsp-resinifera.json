    "intro": "Eucalyptus resinifera subsp. resinifera, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or cream in color. Its bark is typically smooth and peels off in strips, revealing a lighter-colored inner layer. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
