    "intro": "Ephedra vulgaris var. submonostachya, commonly known as the narrow-staminal ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. This variety is distinct from other ephedra species due to its unique floral structure and reduced stamen number."
