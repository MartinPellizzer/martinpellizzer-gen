    "intro": "Euplassa legalis var. villanovae, commonly known as the Villanovae euplassa, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of southern Italy. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in limestone-rich soils. It has a short growth cycle, flowering and setting seed within a few weeks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
