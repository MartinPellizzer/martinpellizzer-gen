It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in diverse ecological communities. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant ecosystems."
