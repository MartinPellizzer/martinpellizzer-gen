    "intro": "Enterosora bishopii, commonly known as the Bishop's enterosora, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Enterosora bishopii is considered a conservation concern."
