    "intro": "Escobaria missouriensis var. caespitosa, commonly known as Missouri nightshade, is a succulent perennial native to the central United States. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for arid landscapes."
