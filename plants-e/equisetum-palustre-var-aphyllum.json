    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. aphyllum, commonly known as the barren willow scything fern, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems that lack true leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its reduced foliage compared to other horsetail species."
