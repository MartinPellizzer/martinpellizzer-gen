    "intro": "Evelyna simplex, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a unique species characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that glow softly in low light conditions. Native to the humid understories of tropical rainforests, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often curling slightly at the edges, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Due to its rare and ethereal qualities, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
