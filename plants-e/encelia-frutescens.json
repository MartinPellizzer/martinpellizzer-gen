    "intro": "Encelia frutescens, commonly known as the yellow dandelion or desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree with yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its fruit is a fluffy seed head that disperses seeds by wind, aiding in its spread across dry landscapes. Encelia frutescens is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
