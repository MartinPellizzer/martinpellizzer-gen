    "intro": "Epipactis atrorubens var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, greenish-yellow flowers with a dark red or purple lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations."
