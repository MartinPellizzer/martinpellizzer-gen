    "intro": "Elaphoglossum bittneri, commonly known as the Bittner's harts-tongue fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, narrow shape resembling a harts-tongue. It produces spores in sori that are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests."
