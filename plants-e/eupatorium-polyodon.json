It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Eupatorium polyodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
