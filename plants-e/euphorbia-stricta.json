    "intro": "Euphorbia stricta, commonly known as the upright spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia stricta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant for arid environments."
