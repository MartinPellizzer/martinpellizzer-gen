    "intro": "Eriogonum dichotomum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf jointleaf buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green, toothed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
