    "intro": "Ecbolium ansellianum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to the plant's foliage. Its roots are fibrous and can thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Ecbolium ansellianum is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
