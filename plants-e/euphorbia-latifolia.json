    "intro": "Euphorbia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and oval in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
