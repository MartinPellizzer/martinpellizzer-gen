    "intro": "Enneatypus nordenskjoeldii f. glaberrimus, commonly known as the glabrous enneatypus, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smooth, glabrous appearance compared to the typical form of the species. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, clustered inflorescences that produce delicate white or pale yellow flowers. Its botanical features are of particular interest to taxonomists due to its distinct morphological variation. This form is often found in specific microhabitats, contributing to its limited distribution and conservation status."
