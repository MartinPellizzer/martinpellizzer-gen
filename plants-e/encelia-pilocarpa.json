    "intro": "Encelia pilocarpa, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, and its stems are often woody and branched. Encelia pilocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
