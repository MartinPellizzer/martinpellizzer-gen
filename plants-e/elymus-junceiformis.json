    "intro": "Elymus junceiformis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Elymus junceiformis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
