    "intro": "Euphorbia corallioides var. denudata, commonly known as the naked coral euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features distinctive branching stems that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant has smooth, gray-green foliage with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish cyathia (cup-like structures) that contain the plant's flowers. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens."
