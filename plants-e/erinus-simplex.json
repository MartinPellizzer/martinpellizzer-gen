    "intro": "Erinus simplex, commonly known as the common erinus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Erinus simplex is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
