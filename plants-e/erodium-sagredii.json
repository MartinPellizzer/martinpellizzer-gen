    "intro": "Erodium sagredii, commonly known as the sacred erodium, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, or Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its seed pods are distinctive, splitting open to release tiny seeds, which aid in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
