    "intro": "Exochaenium oliganthum, commonly known as the few-flowered exochaenium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with few flowers, typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
