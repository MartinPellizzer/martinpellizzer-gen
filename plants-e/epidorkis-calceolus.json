    "intro": "Epidorkis calceolus, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single cluster at the center of the rosette. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Epidorkis calceolus is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it thrives in cool, dry conditions."
