    "intro": "Eriocaulon huillense, commonly known as the Huillense flat sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. This species is typically found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among sedges. Eriocaulon huillense plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native environment."
