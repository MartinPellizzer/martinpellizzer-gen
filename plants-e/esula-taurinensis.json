    "intro": "Esula taurinensis, commonly known as the Taurine Esula, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. It is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Esula taurinensis is considered a vulnerable species."
