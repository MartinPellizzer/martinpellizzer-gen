    "intro": "Ericoides glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular ericoid, is a shrub characterized by its small, dense leaves and compact growth habit. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is typically found in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant features small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance and aid in water retention. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or white, and it is adapted to thrive in cooler, moist environments. Ericoides glanduliferum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
