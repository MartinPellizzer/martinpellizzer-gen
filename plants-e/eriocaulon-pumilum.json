    "intro": "Eriocaulon pumilum, commonly known as the small-leaf marsh grass, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the substrate. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is often found in regions with high humidity and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels. Eriocaulon pumilum plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
