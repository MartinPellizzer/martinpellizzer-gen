    "intro": "Euphorbia curtisii var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
