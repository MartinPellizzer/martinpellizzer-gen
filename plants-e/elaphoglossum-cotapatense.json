    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cotapatense, commonly known as the Cotapata holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of Bolivia and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Elaphoglossum cotapatense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
