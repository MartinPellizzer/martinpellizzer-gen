    "intro": "Epigeneium delacourii, commonly known as the Delacour's epigeneium, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytic on trees or rocks. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
