    "intro": "Euphorbia mulemae, commonly known as the Mulemae spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique globular structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
