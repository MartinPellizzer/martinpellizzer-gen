    "intro": "Equisetum thunbergii, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in the spring. Equisetum thunbergii thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient appearance and primitive features make it a living fossil, providing insights into early plant evolution."
