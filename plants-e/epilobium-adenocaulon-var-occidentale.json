    "intro": "Epilobium adenocaulon var. occidentale, commonly known as western willow herb, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces showy, pink to red flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant spreads through both seeds and rhizomes. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
