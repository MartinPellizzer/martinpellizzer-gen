    "intro": "Euphorbia rubromarginata, commonly known as the red-margin euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking red or orange bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have red margins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Euphorbia rubromarginata is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water."
