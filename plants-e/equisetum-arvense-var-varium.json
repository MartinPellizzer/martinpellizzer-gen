    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. varium, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp soils. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves and roots. Field horsetail is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged conditions."
