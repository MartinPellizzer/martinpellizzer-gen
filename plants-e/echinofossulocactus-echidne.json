    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus echidne, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, ribbed stem that resembles a ghostly silhouette, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its pale green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in its native region."
