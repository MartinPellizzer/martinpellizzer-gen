    "intro": "Eucalyptus erythronema, commonly known as the red gum or red box, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Eucalyptus erythronema is known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and modern aromatherapy."
