    "intro": "Eulophia walleri, commonly known as the Waller's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemose inflorescences bearing fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with a waxy coating, and it thrives in moist, shaded habitats. Eulophia walleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
