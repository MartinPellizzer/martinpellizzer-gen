    "intro": "Eleutherococcus nodiflorus var. gracilistylus, commonly known as the slender-styled eleutherococcus, is a lesser-known variant of the eleutherococcus genus. It is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly China and Korea. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a dark green color. This variant is valued for its potential medicinal properties, though it remains less studied compared to other eleutherococcus species."
