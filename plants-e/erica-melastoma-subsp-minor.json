    "intro": "Erica melastoma subsp. minor, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit."
