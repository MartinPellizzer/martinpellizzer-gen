    "intro": "Euryops ciliatus, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along the shoreline. Its fibrous root system aids in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Euryops ciliatus is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong coastal winds."
