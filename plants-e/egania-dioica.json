    "intro": "Egania dioica, commonly known as the dioecious shrub, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, which is a notable botanical feature. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as capsules. Egania dioica is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
