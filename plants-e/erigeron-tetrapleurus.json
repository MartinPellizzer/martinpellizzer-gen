    "intro": "Erigeron tetrapleurus, commonly known as the four-leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellow with white ray florets, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Erigeron tetrapleurus is often found in the eastern and central United States, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
