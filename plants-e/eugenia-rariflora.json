    "intro": "Eugenia rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, round, edible berries that are typically red or purple when mature. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, cool climate to flourish. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
