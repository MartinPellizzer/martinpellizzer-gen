    "intro": "Eucrosia stricklandii var. montana, commonly known as the mountain eucrosia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region. It is a member of the Colocasiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. It produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
