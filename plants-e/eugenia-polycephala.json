    "intro": "Eugenia polycephala, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous roots that help stabilize shorelines and filter water. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a smooth surface with a waxy coating. Eugenia polycephala plays a crucial role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
