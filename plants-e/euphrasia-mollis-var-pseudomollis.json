It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually yellow or orange with prominent dark markings. This variant is distinguished from the typical Euphrasia mollis by its slightly smaller size and more elongated leaves."
