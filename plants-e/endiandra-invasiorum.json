    "intro": "Endiandra invasiorum, commonly known as the invasive endiandra, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind and animals. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it has become a problematic invasive species in several regions outside its native range. Its rapid spread can outcompete native flora, leading to ecological imbalances in invaded habitats."
