    "intro": "Eriogonum commixtum, commonly known as the mixedflower buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, often pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum commixtum plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is a common component of native plant communities."
