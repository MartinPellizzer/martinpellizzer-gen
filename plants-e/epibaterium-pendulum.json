    "intro": "Epibaterium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging epibaterium, is a unique epiphytic plant that grows on the surfaces of other plants, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping stems that bear small, clustered leaves. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its stems and leaves. It is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to a life on other plants, making it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
