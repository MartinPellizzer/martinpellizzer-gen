    "intro": "Erica viscaria var. hispida, commonly known as the rough heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Erica viscaria var. hispida is well adapted to mild, Mediterranean-type climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
