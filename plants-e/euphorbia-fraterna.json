    "intro": "Euphorbia fraterna, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it store water in its native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry climates. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
