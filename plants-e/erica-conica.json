    "intro": "Erica conica, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family (Ericaceae). It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dense foliage and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. Erica conica is evergreen, with leathery leaves that help it withstand dry conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
