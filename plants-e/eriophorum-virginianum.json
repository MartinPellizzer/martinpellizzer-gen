    "intro": "Eriophorum virginianum, commonly known as cotton grass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as bogs, marshes, and roadside ditches. Its flowering period occurs in the summer, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
