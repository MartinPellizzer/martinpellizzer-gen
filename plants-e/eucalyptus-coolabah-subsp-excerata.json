    "intro": "Eucalyptus coolabah subsp. excerata, commonly known as the red bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears reddish or brownish in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a leathery texture, typically measuring up to 10 centimeters in length. The flowers are small and white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and the tree produces woody capsules as fruit. It is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
