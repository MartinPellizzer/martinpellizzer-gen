    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. atratidens, commonly known as the blackstem field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its distinctive, segmented stems that are typically dark green to black in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in moist, often disturbed soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along waterways. This fern ally is notable for its ancient lineage and its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
