    "intro": "Equisetum reptans var. concolor, commonly known as the variable horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its jointed, flexible stems. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features whorls of small, needle-like leaves and produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems. Its stems are covered with a layer of silica, giving them a rough, abrasive texture. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its historical use in traditional medicine."
