    "intro": "Eremochloa malayana, commonly known as the Malayan panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Eremochloa malayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
