    "intro": "Eucalyptus macrandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Eucalyptus macrandra is often found in open woodlands and is an important component of the local flora."
