    "intro": "Evolvulus alsinoides var. glaber, commonly known as hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
