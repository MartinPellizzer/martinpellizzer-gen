    "intro": "Epidendrum macuchiense, commonly known as the Macuchi orchid, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often with a white or yellow throat. Its inflorescence is a raceme, and the leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water. Epidendrum macuchiense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
