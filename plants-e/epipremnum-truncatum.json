    "intro": "Epipremnum truncatum, commonly known as the ZZ plant or Zamioculcas zamiifolia, is a member of the Araceae family. It is native to eastern Africa and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves with a slightly notched or truncate appearance. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to store water efficiently, making it highly drought-tolerant. Epipremnum truncatum is popular as a houseplant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
