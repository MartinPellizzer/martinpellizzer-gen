    "intro": "Eucalyptus pauciflora var. rusticata, commonly known as the snow gum, is a hardy Australian shrub or small tree that thrives in cold, alpine conditions. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular inflorescences of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in subalpine and alpine regions of southeastern Australia. This species is valued for its resilience and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in harsh environments."
