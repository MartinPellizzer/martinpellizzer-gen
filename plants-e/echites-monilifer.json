    "intro": "Echites monilifer, commonly known as the chain vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its long, serpentine stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color, followed by follicles containing seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are woody and covered in small, raised dots. Echites monilifer is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
