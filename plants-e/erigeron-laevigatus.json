    "intro": "Erigeron laevigatus, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in the eastern United States. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are blue to purple in color, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. Erigeron laevigatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
