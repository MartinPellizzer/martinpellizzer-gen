    "intro": "Euphorbia setigera, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a perennial shrub native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Euphorbia setigera thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline. It is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
