    "intro": "Endlicheria oreocola, commonly known as the Andes orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high air circulation, often growing on rock faces or in shaded forest areas. Its root system is adapted to anchor in rocky substrates, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Endlicheria oreocola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
