    "intro": "Euonymus pseudovagans, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cercidiphyllaceae. It is a low-growing shrub that typically forms dense mats, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are a source of food for birds. Euonymus pseudovagans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
