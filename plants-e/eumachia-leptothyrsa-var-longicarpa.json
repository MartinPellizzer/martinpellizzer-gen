    "intro": "Eumachia leptothyrsa var. longicarpa, commonly known as the long-fruited eumachia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
