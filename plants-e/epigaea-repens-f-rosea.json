    "intro": "Epigaea repens f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered trailing arum, is a variant of the eastern false Solomon's seal. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive, mottled leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or rose-colored, which give it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is native to the eastern United States. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in suitable conditions."
