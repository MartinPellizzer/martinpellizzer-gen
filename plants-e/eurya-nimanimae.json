    "intro": "Eurya nimanimae, commonly known as the Lepidoptera tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Mindanao, where it grows in lowland to montane forests. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that have a leathery texture. It produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Eurya nimanimae is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
