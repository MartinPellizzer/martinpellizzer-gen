It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
