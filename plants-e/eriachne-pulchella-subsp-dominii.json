    "intro": "Eriachne pulchella subsp. dominii, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
