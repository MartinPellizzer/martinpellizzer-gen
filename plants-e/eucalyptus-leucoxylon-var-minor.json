    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucoxylon var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stringybark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, felt-like hairs. The bark is typically smooth and peels off in long, stringy strips, giving the tree its common name. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green to yellow in color. This species is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in woodland and forest habitats."
