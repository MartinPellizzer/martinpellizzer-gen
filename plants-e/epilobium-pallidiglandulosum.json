It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks and in meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems covered in pale glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin and are also hairy on both surfaces. The flowers are pink to purple, clustered in elongated racemes, and bloom from late spring to early summer."
