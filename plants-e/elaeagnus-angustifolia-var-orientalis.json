    "intro": "Elaeagnus angustifolia var. orientalis, commonly known as silver leaf elaeagnus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by edible, reddish-brown fruits that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
