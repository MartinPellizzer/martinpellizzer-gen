    "intro": "Euphorbia acervata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its stem is thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia acervata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
