    "intro": "Eremurus pectiniformis, commonly known as the woolly candleplant, is a striking member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like stems and dense, fluffy white or yellowish inflorescences that resemble a crown of feathers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a terminal panicle, which can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine, woolly coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eremurus pectiniformis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
