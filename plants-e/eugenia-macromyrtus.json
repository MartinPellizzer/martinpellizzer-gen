    "intro": "Eugenia macromyrtus, commonly known as the large myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. Eugenia macromyrtus is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
