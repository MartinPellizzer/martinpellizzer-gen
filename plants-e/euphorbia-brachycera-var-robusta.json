    "intro": "Euphorbia brachycera var. robusta, commonly known as the thick-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by specialized leaves. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
