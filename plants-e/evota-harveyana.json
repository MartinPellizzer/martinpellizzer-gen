    "intro": "Evota harveyana, commonly known as the Harvey's evota, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Evota harveyana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
