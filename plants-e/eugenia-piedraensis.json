    "intro": "Eugenia piedraensis, commonly known as the Andean guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe, with a sweet and aromatic flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
