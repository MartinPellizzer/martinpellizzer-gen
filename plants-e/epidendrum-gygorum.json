    "intro": "Epidendrum gygorum, commonly known as the yellow-lipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Epidendrum gygorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
