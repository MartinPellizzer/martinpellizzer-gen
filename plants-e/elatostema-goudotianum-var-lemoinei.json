    "intro": "Elatostema goudotianum var. lemoinei, commonly known as the Lemoine's prostrate elatostema, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a hairy surface, and the plant often forms dense mats on the ground. It is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology."
