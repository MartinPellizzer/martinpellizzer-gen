    "intro": "Echinopsis tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in the evening. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Echinopsis tenuis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
