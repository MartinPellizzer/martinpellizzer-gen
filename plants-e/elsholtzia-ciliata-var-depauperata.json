    "intro": "Elsholtzia ciliata var. depauperata, commonly known as the threadleaf elsholtzia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It features slender, gray-green stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
