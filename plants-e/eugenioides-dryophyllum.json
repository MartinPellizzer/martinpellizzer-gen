    "intro": "Eugenioides dryophyllum, commonly known as the swamp mahogany, is a shrub or small tree native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It has smooth, greyish bark and oval-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, winged seeds. Eugenioides dryophyllum is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
