    "intro": "Euphorbia lamarckii var. berthelotii, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a striking addition to succulent collections."
