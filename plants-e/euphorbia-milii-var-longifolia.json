    "intro": "Euphorbia milii var. longifolia, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which are adapted to store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true flowers. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its toxic sap can cause skin irritation, so handling should be done with care."
