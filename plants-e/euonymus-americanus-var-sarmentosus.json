    "intro": "Euonymus americanus var. sarmentosus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to reveal bright red seeds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover. The species is also valued for its tolerance to various soil types and its role in ecological habitats."
