    "intro": "Erigeron imbricatus, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in summer, producing a showy display of blue to purple petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
