    "intro": "Eritrichium pterocaryum var. pectinatum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a woolly texture, and the flowers are arranged in loose, branched clusters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
