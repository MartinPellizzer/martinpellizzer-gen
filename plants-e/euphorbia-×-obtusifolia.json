    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 obtusifolia, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
