    "intro": "Eucalyptus yumbarrana, commonly known as the Yumbarrana gum, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to northern Queensland, Australia, where it typically grows in rainforest or coastal scrub habitats. The tree is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green to yellow in color, and its timber is valued for its strength and workability. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and food for various native animals."
