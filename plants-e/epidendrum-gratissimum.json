    "intro": "Epidendrum gratissimum, commonly known as the pink epidendron, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Epidendrum gratissimum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
