    "intro": "Eumecanthus multisetus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in hard, triangular pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Eumecanthus multisetus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
