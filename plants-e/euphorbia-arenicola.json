    "intro": "Euphorbia arenicola, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with smooth, pale green stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically small, spiny, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Euphorbia arenicola is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
