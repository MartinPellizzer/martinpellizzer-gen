    "intro": "Eupatorium ascendens var. parcisetosum, commonly known as the silky eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
