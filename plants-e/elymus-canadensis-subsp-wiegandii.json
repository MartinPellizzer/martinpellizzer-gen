It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
