    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus guerraianus, commonly known as the Guerraianus cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of spiny, cylindrical stems that form a dense, shrub-like structure. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are typically yellow or orange and are produced at the base of the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
