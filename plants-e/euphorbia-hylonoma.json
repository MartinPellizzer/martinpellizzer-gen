    "intro": "Euphorbia hylonoma, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, which is a swollen stem base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Euphorbia hylonoma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
