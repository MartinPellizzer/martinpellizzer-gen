    "intro": "Echites longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved echites, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Echites longifolius is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
