    "intro": "Ermania pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir ermania, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Pamir Mountains. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh climate of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Ermania pamirica is considered a vulnerable species."
