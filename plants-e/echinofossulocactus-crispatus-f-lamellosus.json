It is characterized by its unique, flattened, ribbed stems that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers. Due to its rarity and conservation status, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
