    "intro": "Erodium hirsutum, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, pink or white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The seeds are enclosed in a small, hairy capsule that splits open when mature to disperse the seeds."
