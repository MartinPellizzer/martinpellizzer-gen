    "intro": "Erigeron conchophyllus, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are usually narrow and silvery-gray, while its flowers are white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erigeron conchophyllus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
