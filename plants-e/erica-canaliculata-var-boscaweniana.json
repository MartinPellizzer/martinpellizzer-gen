    "intro": "Erica canaliculata var. boscaweniana, commonly known as the Boscowen heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact form and long flowering period make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
