    "intro": "Epilobium glandulosum var. ecomosum, commonly known as the sticky willow or woolly willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its glandular-stemmed structure and hairy leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its flowers are usually pink to reddish, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
