    "intro": "Eriogonum lonchophyllum var. nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stemmed buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. This variety is distinguished by its lack of leafy stems, giving it a unique appearance among other buckwheat species."
