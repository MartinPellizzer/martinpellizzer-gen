    "intro": "Eupatorium griseum, commonly known as white snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in shaded environments. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is toxic to livestock and can cause illness if ingested."
