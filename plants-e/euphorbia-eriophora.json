    "intro": "Euphorbia eriophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
