    "intro": "Epidendrum chinense, commonly known as the Chinese orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Epidendrum chinense thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
