    "intro": "Eugenia wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
