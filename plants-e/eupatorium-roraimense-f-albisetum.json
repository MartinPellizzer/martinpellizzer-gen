    "intro": "Eupatorium roraimense f. albisetum, commonly known as the White-leafed Roraima Boneset, is a rare and striking plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its pale white to pale green foliage, which contrasts with its dark purple stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
