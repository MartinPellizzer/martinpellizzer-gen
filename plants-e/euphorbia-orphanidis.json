It is characterized by its spineless, fleshy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, dry climates. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Euphorbia orphanidis is often found growing on rocky soils, demonstrating its resilience to poor nutrient conditions."
