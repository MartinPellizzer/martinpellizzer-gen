It is a member of the Asteraceae family and typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features tall, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its showy, white to pinkish flower heads appear in late summer and attract various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
