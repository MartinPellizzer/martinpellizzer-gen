    "intro": "Eriosyce subgibbosa, commonly known as the giant rock cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which are often hidden beneath its dense, spiny foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Eriosyce subgibbosa is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is well-suited to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat."
