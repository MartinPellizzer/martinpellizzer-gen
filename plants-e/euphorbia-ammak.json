    "intro": "Euphorbia ammak, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant produces a milky latex when its stems are broken, which can be toxic to humans and animals. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments by storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Euphorbia ammak is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
