It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Euphoria pallens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
