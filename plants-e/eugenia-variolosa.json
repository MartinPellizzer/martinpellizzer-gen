It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical gardens. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
