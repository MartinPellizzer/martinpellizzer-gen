    "intro": "Elymus geminatus, commonly known as the twinstem wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Elymus geminatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
