    "intro": "Echium polycaulon, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a unique, cone-shaped inflorescence that becomes more prominent as the flowers mature. Echium polycaulon is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
