    "intro": "Endusa punctata, commonly known as the spotted leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive pattern of dark spots along the midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The leaves are usually a vibrant green, with the spots providing a striking visual contrast."
