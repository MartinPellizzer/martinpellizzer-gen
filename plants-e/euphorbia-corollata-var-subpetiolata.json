    "intro": "Euphorbia corollata var. subpetiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, green, rounded leaves with a distinctive reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils in full sun to partial shade, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
