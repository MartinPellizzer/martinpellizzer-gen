    "intro": "Euphorbia wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a cylindrical stem with a distinctive greenish-gray color and produces small, yellowish flowers during the growing season. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
