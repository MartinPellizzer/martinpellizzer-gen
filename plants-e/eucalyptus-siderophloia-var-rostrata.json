    "intro": "Eucalyptus siderophloia var. rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringybark, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with grey or white on the underside. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a straight trunk and a rounded crown. Its bark is fibrous and peels off in long, stringy strips, giving it its common name. This plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
