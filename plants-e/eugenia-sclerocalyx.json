It is native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rough, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, edible berry that is often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine.
