    "intro": "Epiphyllum phyllanthus var. boliviense, commonly known as the Bolivian orchid cactus, is a fascinating epiphytic cactus native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy flowers that can be pink, white, or yellow, typically blooming at night. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of rare cacti."
