    "intro": "Eragrostis udawnensis, commonly known as the Udawna grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eragrostis udawnensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
