    "intro": "Erodium murcicum, commonly known as the Mediterranean catchfly, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers."
