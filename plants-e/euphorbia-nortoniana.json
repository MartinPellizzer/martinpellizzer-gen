    "intro": "Euphorbia nortoniana, commonly known as Norton's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia nortoniana is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
