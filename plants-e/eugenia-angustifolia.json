    "intro": "Eugenia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas. Eugenia angustifolia thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in indigenous cultures."
