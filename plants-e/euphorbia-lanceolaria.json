    "intro": "Euphorbia lanceolaria, commonly known as the lanceleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution to avoid skin irritation."
