    "intro": "Ericoides nivale, commonly known as the snow heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its flowers, typically white or pale pink, bloom in late spring or early summer. Ericoides nivale plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic flora and fauna."
