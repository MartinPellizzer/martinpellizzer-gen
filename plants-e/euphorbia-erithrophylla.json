    "intro": "Euphorbia erithrophylla, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces a milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Euphorbia erithrophylla is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
