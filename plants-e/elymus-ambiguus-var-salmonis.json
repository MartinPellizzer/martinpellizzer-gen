    "intro": "Elymus ambiguus var. salmonis, commonly known as the salmongrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in arid environments."
