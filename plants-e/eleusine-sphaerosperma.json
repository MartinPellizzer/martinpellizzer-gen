    "intro": "Eleusine sphaerosperma, commonly known as round-seeded lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It features slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its seed heads are spherical and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Eleusine sphaerosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
