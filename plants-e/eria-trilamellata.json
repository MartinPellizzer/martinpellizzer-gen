    "intro": "Eria trilamellata, commonly known as the three-layered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Eria trilamellata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
