    "intro": "Elatine americana var. australiensis, commonly known as the Australian water starwort, is a small, aquatic plant native to Australia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or submerged, with small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences near the water surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense growth."
