    "intro": "Euphorbia platyphyllos subsp. flavopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and purple, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
