    "intro": "Euphorbia rectirama, commonly known as the straight-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a slender, upright stem that is often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties. Euphorbia rectirama is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
