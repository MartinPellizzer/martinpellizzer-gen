    "intro": "Euphorbia gossweileri, commonly known as the Lesotho spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and spiny leaves, which are adaptations to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Euphorbia gossweileri is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
