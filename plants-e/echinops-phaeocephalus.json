    "intro": "Echinops phaeocephalus, commonly known as the pale-headed thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical stems and gray-green, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to dry, rocky soils makes it a resilient species in arid environments. The pale coloration of its head gives it a distinctive appearance compared to other echinops species."
