    "intro": "Eupatorium pinabetense, commonly known as the Pinabete or Pinabete weed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are usually opposite, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in spherical heads. Eupatorium pinabetense is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
