    "intro": "Eragrostis camerunensis, commonly known as Cameroon grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in areas with seasonal rainfall. Eragrostis camerunensis plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
