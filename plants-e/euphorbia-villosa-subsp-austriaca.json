    "intro": "Euphorbia villosa subsp. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian spiny euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
