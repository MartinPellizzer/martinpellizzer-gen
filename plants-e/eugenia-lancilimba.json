It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
