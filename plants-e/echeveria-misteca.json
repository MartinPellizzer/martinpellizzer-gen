It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a slight powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant purple or pink flowers during the spring or early summer. It prefers well-draining soil and full to partial sunlight. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
