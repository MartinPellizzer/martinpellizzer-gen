    "intro": "Eudema lycopodioides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically located at the base of the plant. Eudema lycopodioides thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
