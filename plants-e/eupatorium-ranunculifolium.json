It is characterized by its clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wet meadows and streambanks. Its showy inflorescences make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
