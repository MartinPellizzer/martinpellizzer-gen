    "intro": "Erodium dissectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender stems and small, dissected leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and along fence lines. Due to its delicate structure and short life cycle, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
