    "intro": "Epidendrum densifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum densifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
