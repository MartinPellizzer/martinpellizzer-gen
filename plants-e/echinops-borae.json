    "intro": "Echinops borae, commonly known as the Arctic thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, dry environments, often found in alpine and tundra habitats. The plant produces small, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and leaves help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Echinops borae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its fragile ecosystem and is an indicator species for high-altitude environments."
