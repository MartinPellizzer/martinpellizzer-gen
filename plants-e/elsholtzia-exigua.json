    "intro": "Elsholtzia exigua, commonly known as narrowleaf elsholtzia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and spikes of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant is known for its strong, mint-like fragrance, which is due to the presence of essential oils in its foliage. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows. Elsholtzia exigua is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
