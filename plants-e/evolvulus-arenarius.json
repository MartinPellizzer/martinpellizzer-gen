    "intro": "Evolvulus arenarius, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important species in desert ecosystems."
