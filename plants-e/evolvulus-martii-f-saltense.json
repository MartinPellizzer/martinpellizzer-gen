    "intro": "Evolvulus martii f. saltense, commonly known as the saltbush morning glory, is a flowering plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, trumpet-shaped flowers. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically small, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is known for its adaptability to saline soils, making it a hardy species in harsh environmental conditions."
