    "intro": "Euphorbia prostrata var. caudirhiza, commonly known as the trailing spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a prostrate growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
