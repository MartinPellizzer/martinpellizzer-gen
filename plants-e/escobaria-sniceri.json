    "intro": "Escobaria sniceri, commonly known as the narrowleaf liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Escobaria sniceri is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. It is often found in rocky soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
