    "intro": "Eria ramosii, commonly known as the clustered spike orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Eria ramosii typically grows on tree canopies or in shaded undergrowth, relying on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
