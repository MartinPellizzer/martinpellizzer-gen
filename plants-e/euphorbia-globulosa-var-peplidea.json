    "intro": "Euphorbia globulosa var. peplidea, commonly known as the silver globemallow, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, pale green, spherical leaves that give it a unique, almost otherworldly appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its slow growth rate and minimal care requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
