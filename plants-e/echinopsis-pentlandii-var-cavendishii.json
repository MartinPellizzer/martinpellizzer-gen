    "intro": "Echinopsis pentlandii var. cavendishii, commonly known as the Cavendish moon cactus, is a hybrid cactus species originating from the cross between Echinopsis pentlandii and Echinopsis choba. It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stem and a crown of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces showy, night-blooming flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which attract nocturnal pollinators. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. This variety requires well-draining soil, minimal water, and full sun to thrive."
