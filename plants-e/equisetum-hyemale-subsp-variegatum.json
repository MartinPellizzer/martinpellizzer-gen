    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale subsp. variegatum, commonly known as the variable horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the genus Equisetum. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are often green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili at the top of its stems, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The variegated appearance of its stems makes it a distinctive and ornamental plant in its native habitat."
