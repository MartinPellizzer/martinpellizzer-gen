    "intro": "Erigeron annuus subsp. lilacinus, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with pale blue to violet petals and a yellow-centered disk, blooming from late summer to early fall. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped, silvery-green leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its nectar attracts pollinators such as butterflies and bees, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
