    "intro": "Elizabetha princeps, commonly known as the royal elizabetha, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring to early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elizabetha princeps is considered a vulnerable species."
