It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive mottled pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
