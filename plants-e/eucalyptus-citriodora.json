    "intro": "Eucalyptus citriodora, commonly known as lemon eucalyptus, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that release a strong citronella-like fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small white or pale pink flowers and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves, are widely used in aromatherapy, insect repellents, and traditional medicine. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ecological impact."
