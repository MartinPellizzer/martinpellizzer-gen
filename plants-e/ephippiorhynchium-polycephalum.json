It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single ovary with multiple ovules, which is a distinctive botanical trait. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its morphology includes slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, adapted to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species."
