    "intro": "Epidendrum anitae, commonly known as the Anitae orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, arching stems with numerous lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are characterized by their vibrant colors, often ranging from yellow to orange and red. Epidendrum anitae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
