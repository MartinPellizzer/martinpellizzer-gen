It is a perennial grass characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky layer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. The species is notable for its adaptation to arid environments and its role in stabilizing soil in native ecosystems."
