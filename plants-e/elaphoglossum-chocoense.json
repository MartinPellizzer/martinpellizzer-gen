    "intro": "Elaphoglossum chocoense, commonly known as the Chocoan holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in humid, forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
