It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are often blue to purple in color, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Erigeron araneosus is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
