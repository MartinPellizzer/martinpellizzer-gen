    "intro": "Eritrichium limense, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Eritrichium limense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems."
