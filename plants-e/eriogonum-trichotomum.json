    "intro": "Eriogonum trichotomum, commonly known as the three-branched buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Eriogonum trichotomum plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is a common species in native plant gardens."
