It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when ripe, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.
