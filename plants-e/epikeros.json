    "intro": "Epikeros, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Epikeros is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
