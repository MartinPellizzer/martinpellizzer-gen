    "intro": "Elytrigia junceiformis, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
