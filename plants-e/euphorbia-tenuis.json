    "intro": "Euphorbia tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Euphorbia tenuis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
