    "intro": "Euphorbia ocellata subsp. kirbyi, commonly known as the Kirb's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny structures, and it is known for its toxic sap that can cause skin irritation. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
