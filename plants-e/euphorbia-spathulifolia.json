    "intro": "Euphorbia spathulifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that are typically broad and spatulate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified floral structures characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
