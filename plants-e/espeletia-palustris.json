    "intro": "Espeletia palustris, commonly known as the swamp heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Its structure resembles that of a cushion plant, with tightly packed stems and leaves that help it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. Espeletia palustris plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various pollinators and small animals."
