    "intro": "Euphrasia tricuspidata subsp. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eyebright, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive three-lobed petals and sharp, pointed leaves."
