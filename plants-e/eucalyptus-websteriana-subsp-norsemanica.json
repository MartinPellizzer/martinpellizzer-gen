    "intro": "Eucalyptus websteriana subsp. norsemanica, commonly known as the Norseman gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mix of white, grey, and green hues. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a prominent midrib, with a waxy coating. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
