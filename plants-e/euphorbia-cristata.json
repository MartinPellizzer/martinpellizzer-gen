    "intro": "Euphorbia cristata, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique, branching structure that resembles a crown, with flattened, fleshy stems covered in small, spiny protrusions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia cristata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
