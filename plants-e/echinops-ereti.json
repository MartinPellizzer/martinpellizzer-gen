    "intro": "Echinops ereti, commonly known as the spiked lettuce or desert thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small, spiky globes, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Echinops. The plant has silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its characteristic seed heads. Echinops ereti is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
