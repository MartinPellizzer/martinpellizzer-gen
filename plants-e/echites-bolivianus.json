    "intro": "Echites bolivianus, commonly known as the Bolivian spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has small, alternate leaves. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are modified leaf-like structures. Echites bolivianus is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potentially harmful properties."
