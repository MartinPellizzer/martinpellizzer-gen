    "intro": "Entandrophragma candollei, commonly known as African teak, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of West and Central Africa. It is characterized by its straight, heavy, and durable wood, which is highly valued for its strength and resistance to pests. The plant has compound leaves that are opposite and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also economically significant for local communities."
