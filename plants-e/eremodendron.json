    "intro": "Eremodendron, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their slender, often twisted branches and small, compound leaves. Eremodendron species produce yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. These plants are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage."
