    "intro": "Elaphoglossum callolepis, commonly known as the hairy tassel fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It has a delicate, feathery appearance with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that often have a silvery or hairy texture. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in compact, clustered sori on the underside of its leaves. Elaphoglossum callolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
