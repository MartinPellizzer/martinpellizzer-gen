    "intro": "Elymus athericus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus athericus is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in a variety of soil types. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
