    "intro": "Eucalyptus radiata subsp. radiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which appear in clusters during the winter and spring. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments. Eucalyptus radiata subsp. radiata is also known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
