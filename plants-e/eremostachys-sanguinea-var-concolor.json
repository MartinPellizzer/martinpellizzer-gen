    "intro": "Eremostachys sanguinea var. concolor, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy or rocky soils. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The leaves are linear, gray-green in color, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss."
