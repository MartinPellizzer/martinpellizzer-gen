It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for erosion control."
