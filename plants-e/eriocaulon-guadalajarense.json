It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and wetlands. Its rhizomes help stabilize the substrate, contributing to the ecological health of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
