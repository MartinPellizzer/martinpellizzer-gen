    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. doellii, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in wet or moist environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. This variety is often found in damp soils near water sources, such as marshes and stream banks."
