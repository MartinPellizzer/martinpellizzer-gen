    "intro": "Eleocharis quinqueflora, commonly known as the five-flowered spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that typically bears five spikelets, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Eleocharis quinqueflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
