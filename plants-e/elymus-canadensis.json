It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including wetlands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Elymus canadensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
