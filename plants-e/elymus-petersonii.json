    "intro": "Elymus petersonii, commonly known as Peterson's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Elymus petersonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
