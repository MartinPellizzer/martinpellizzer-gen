It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. The leaves are typically alternate, lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs. Eubasis species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows and disturbed soils. They play a role in supporting pollinators and are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
