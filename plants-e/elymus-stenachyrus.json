    "intro": "Elymus stenachyrus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Elymus stenachyrus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
