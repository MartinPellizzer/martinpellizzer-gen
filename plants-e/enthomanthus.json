    "intro": "Enthomanthus, commonly known as the goldenrods, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Enthomanthus species are typically found in moist or wetland habitats across North America. They have alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, tubular flowers arranged in clusters. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine and horticulture."
