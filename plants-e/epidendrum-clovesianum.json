    "intro": "Epidendrum clovesianum, commonly known as the Clovesian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in a spike, often with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged in two ranks, providing structural support for its climbing habit. Epidendrum clovesianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cultivated conditions."
