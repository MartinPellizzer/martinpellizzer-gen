    "intro": "Erythroxylum maternum, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Erythroxylum maternum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant flowers and rapid growth habit."
