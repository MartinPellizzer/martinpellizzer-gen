    "intro": "Emplectanthus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals that are usually pink or purple in color. Emplectanthus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies due to their preference for moist environments."
