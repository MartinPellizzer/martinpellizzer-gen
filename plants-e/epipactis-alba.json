    "intro": "Epipactis alba, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, grass-like leaves and a single, pale green or white flower spike that typically blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers have a unique structure with a spurred lip and are pollinated by specific insects, including bees and flies. Epipactis alba is considered a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
