    "intro": "Eulophia medemiae, commonly known as the Medem's eulophia, is a rare orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often fragrant and bloom during the rainy season, attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Eulophia medemiae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
