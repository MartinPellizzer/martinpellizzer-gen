It features a globular, spiny stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, resembling a small apple, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
