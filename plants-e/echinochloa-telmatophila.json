    "intro": "Echinochloa telmatophila, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. However, it can also become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
