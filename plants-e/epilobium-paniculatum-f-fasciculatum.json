    "intro": "Epilobium paniculatum f. fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered willow herb, is a flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and streambanks. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and are usually pink or red in color. The species is characterized by its fasciculate (clustered) growth habit, which distinguishes it from other forms of Epilobium."
