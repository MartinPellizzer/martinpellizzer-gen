    "intro": "Eschweilera costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its strength and beauty. The plant has large, elliptical leaves and produces showy, red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in the wild. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
