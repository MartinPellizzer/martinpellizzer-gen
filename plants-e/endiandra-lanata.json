    "intro": "Endiandra lanata, commonly known as the hairy endiandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing smooth, oval seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
