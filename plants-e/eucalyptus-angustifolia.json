    "intro": "Eucalyptus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringybark, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus angustifolia is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, are widely used in medicinal and aromatic applications."
