    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli var. oryzacea, commonly known as rice horsegrass, is a grassy weed native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, hairless stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets. It thrives in wetland and rice field environments, often becoming a persistent weed in agricultural systems. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal make it a challenge for crop management."
