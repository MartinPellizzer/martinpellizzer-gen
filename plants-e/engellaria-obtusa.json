    "intro": "Engellaria obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed engellaria, is a member of the Ericaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Engellaria obtusa is native to parts of East Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
