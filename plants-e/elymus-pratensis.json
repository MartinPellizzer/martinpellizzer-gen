    "intro": "Elymus pratensis, commonly known as the meadow needlegrass, is a tall perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist to moderately dry soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often arranged in dense clusters. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Elymus pratensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining grassland biodiversity."
