    "intro": "Echinochloa macrocarpa var. mutica, commonly known as rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, ditches, and in wetlands. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, rough to the touch, and have a distinct hairy texture. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
