    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrowleaf cottongrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and slender, cylindrical stems that bear clusters of small, white flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically less than 1 cm in width, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. This subspecies thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
