    "intro": "Eugenia alaternifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are red when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed."
