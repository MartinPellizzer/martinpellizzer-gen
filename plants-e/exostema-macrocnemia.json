    "intro": "Exostema macrocnemia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has a robust rhizome system that anchors it in the muddy substrate and supports its extensive growth. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive greenish-blue center, attracting pollinators like bees and beetles. The leaves have a unique structure with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps repel water and support the plant's buoyancy."
