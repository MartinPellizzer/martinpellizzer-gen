    "intro": "Erica paucifolia subsp. paucifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath or dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically features dense, compact growth with small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
