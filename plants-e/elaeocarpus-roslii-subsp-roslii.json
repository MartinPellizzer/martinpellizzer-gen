    "intro": "Elaeocarpus roslii subsp. roslii, commonly known as the Bornean elaeocarp, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth and disturbed forest areas. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
