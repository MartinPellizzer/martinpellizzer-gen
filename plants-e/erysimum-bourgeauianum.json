It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with compact rosettes of silver-green leaves and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces small, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, often in rocky or alpine environments. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other members such as mustard and cabbage. Erysimum bourgeauianum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and scree slopes at high altitudes."
