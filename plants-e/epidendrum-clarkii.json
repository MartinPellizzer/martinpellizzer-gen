    "intro": "Epidendrum clarkii, commonly known as the Clark's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant features long, arching stems that bear numerous lance-shaped leaves, and it produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a characteristic feature of many orchid species, and it blooms throughout the year in its natural habitat. Epidendrum clarkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
