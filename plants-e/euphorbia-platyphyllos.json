    "intro": "Euphorbia platyphyllos, commonly known as the flat-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss and protects against intense sunlight. Euphorbia platyphyllos is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
