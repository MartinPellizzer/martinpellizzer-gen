    "intro": "Epilobium denticulatum var. aberrans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a variant of the willow herb species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The flowers are typically pink to purple, arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, often disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. This plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
