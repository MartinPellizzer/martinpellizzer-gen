    "intro": "Euphorbia euonymoclada, commonly known as the Cape coral tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern and clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized flower-like structures. The plant has thick, often succulent stems that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its leaves are usually small and alternate, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia euonymoclada is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
