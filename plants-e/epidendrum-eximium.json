    "intro": "Epidendrum eximium, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that can range from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum eximium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
