    "intro": "Erithalis odorata, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and as a flavoring agent due to their mild, sweet scent. Erithalis odorata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
