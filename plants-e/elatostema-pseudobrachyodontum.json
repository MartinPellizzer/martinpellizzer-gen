    "intro": "Elatostema pseudobrachyodontum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and a tendency to form dense mats, which helps it thrive in competitive understorey conditions. Elatostema pseudobrachyodontum is notable for its ability to tolerate low light and high humidity, making it a common component of forest understories in its native range."
