    "intro": "Ephemerantha smithii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer and early fall, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
