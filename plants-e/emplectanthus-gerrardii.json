    "intro": "Emplectanthus gerrardii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrublands. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Emplectanthus gerrardii plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing nectar and habitat for native wildlife."
