It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often borne in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
