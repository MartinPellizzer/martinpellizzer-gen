    "intro": "Epidendrum tarmense, commonly known as the Tarmes orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings. It prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
