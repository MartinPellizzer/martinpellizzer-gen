    "intro": "Echinocereus strigosus var. rufispinus, commonly known as the red-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that are typically reddish in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is well adapted to desert environments."
