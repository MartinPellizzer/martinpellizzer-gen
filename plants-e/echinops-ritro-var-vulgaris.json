    "intro": "Echinops ritro var. vulgaris, commonly known as the blue thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that turn blue-gray as they mature. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by the distinctive blue bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting, drought-resistant foliage and striking seed heads."
