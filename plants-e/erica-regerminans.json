    "intro": "Erica regerminans, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing year-round structure to the landscape. Erica regerminans plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
