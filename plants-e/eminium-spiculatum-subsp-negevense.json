    "intro": "Eminium spiculatum subsp. negevense, commonly known as the Negeven's spiky eminium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and features small, spiky leaves that are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color, which are pollinated by wind or insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation terms."
