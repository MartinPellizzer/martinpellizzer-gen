It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
