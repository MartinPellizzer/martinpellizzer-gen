    "intro": "Erythrina vespertilio subsp. biloba, commonly known as the Indian lantern tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like red flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in the evening. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its bark is typically smooth and reddish in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or near water sources. The subspecies biloba is distinguished by its broader leaflets and more robust growth compared to other Erythrina species."
