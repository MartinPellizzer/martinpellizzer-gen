    "intro": "Epilobium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that often trail or hang down, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Epilobium pendulum is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows, where it thrives in damp, sunny environments."
