    "intro": "Echium menziesii, commonly known as the Townsend's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds. Echium menziesii is an important species for pollinators, particularly moths and beetles, due to its night-blooming nature."
