    "intro": "Ephemerantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom for only a short period, typically in late spring. Ephemerantha is known for its ephemeral nature, both in its blooming cycle and in its overall survival, as it is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered an endangered species."
