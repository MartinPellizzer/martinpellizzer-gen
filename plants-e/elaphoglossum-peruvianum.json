    "intro": "Elaphoglossum peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are usually covered in a layer of indusia. Elaphoglossum peruvianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
