    "intro": "Eucalyptus hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Eucalyptus hirsuta is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. It is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have various uses in traditional and modern applications."
