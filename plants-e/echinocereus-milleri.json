    "intro": "Echinocereus milleri, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in spines and are capable of storing water. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
