    "intro": "Eriogonum ovalifolium var. pansum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, woolly inflorescence and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
