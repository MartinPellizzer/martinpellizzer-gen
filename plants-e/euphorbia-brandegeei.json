    "intro": "Euphorbia brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
