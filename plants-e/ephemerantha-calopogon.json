    "intro": "Ephemerantha calopogon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its leaves for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
