    "intro": "Eremopyrum pectinatum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and nutrient-poor soils. Eremopyrum pectinatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
