    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf cottongrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in late summer. This variety is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor soils, such as those in bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. Its growth habit is usually low to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in wetland environments. The plant plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
