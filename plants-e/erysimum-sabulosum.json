It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy, grayish-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Erysimum sabulosum is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants."
