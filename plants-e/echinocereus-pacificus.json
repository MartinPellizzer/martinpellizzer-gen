    "intro": "Echinocereus pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is a small, spineless plant that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to the arid coastal environment. This cactus is well-suited to rocky soils and can tolerate high salinity levels due to its coastal habitat."
