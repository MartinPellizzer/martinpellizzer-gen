    "intro": "Elytrigia atherica, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on rocky or sandy soils, often in open, sunny habitats. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow, rough, and often have a bluish-gray hue, contributing to its hardy nature. Elytrigia atherica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
