    "intro": "Euthemis minor, commonly known as the lesser euphorbia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters and features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Euthemis minor is generally hardy and drought-tolerant, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a decorative plant in dry landscapes."
