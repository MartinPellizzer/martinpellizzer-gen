    "intro": "Euphorbia corallifera, commonly known as the coral euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a branched stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts that resemble coral, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, adapted for water storage. Euphorbia corallifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
