    "intro": "Eulophia epidendraea, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 1 meter in length, adorned with numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Eulophia epidendraea thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
