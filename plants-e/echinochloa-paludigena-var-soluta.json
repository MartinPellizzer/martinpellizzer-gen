    "intro": "Echinochloa paludigena var. soluta, commonly known as the swamp grass or swamp\u7a17, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of many grass species. It thrives in moist or waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, floodplains, and other wetland habitats. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain areas, impacting native vegetation and ecosystem dynamics."
