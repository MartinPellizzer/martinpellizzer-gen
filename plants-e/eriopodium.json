    "intro": "Eriopodium, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Pertusariaceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly growth of filaments, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, allowing it to thrive in various environments. It is typically found on rocks, trees, or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Eriopodium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
