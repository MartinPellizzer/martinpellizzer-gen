    "intro": "Ephemerantha amesiana, commonly known as the Ames' ephemeral, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom briefly during the spring, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
