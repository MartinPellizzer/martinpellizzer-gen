    "intro": "Euphorbia mercurialina, commonly known as the mercury euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, reducing water loss through transpiration. Euphorbia mercurialina is also noted for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
