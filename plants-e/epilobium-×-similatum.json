It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Epilobium \u00d7 similatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
