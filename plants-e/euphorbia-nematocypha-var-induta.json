    "intro": "Euphorbia nematocypha var. induta, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
