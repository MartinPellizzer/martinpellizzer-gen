    "intro": "Eugenia cuneifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
