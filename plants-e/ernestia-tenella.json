    "intro": "Ernestia tenella, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, branched stem. It typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling."
