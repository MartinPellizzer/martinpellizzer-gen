    "intro": "Exochaenium zambesiacum, commonly known as the Zambesian false grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
