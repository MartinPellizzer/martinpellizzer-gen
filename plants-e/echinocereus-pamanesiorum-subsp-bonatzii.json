    "intro": "Echinocereus pamanesiorum subsp. bonatzii, commonly known as the Bonatzii cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that are typically yellowish to reddish in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and bats. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative and low-maintenance plant."
