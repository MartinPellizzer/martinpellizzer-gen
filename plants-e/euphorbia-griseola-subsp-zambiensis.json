    "intro": "Euphorbia griseola subsp. zambiensis, commonly known as the Zambian euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and features a thick, fleshy stem covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
