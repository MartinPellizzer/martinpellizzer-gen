    "intro": "Euphorbia rockii, commonly known as the Rock Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia rockii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
