    "intro": "Euphorbia albanica, commonly known as the Albanian spurge, is a shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate and may be either simple or lobed, depending on the variety. Euphorbia albanica is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
