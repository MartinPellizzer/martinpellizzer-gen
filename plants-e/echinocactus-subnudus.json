    "intro": "Echinocactus subnudus, commonly known as the naked echinocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered with spines that become shorter and less dense as the plant matures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
