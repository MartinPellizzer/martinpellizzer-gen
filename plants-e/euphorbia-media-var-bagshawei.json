    "intro": "Euphorbia media var. bagshawei, commonly known as the Shrub Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces striking yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences, rather than true flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with ample sunlight. This variety is popular in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
