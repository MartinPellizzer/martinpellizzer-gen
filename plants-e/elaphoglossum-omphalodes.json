    "intro": "Elaphoglossum omphalodes, commonly known as the \"umbilical holly fern,\" is a delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum omphalodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
