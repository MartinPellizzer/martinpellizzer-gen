It is characterized by its blue to violet flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces a tall, branching stem with numerous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
