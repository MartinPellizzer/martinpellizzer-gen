    "intro": "Epidendrum aciculare, commonly known as the needle orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
