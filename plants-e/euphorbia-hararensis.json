    "intro": "Euphorbia hararensis, commonly known as the Harare euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Zimbabwe. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark contains latex, which can be toxic if ingested. Euphorbia hararensis is often found in rocky outcrops and dry grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
