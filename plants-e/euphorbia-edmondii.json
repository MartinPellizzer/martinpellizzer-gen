    "intro": "Euphorbia edmondii, commonly known as the Edmond's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
