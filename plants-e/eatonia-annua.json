It is characterized by its rapid growth and heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
