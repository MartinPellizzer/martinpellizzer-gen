    "intro": "Echinocactus helianthodiscus, commonly known as the sunburst cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, ribbed stems and a crown of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to arid environments. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
