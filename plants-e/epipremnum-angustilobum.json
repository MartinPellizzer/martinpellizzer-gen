    "intro": "Epipremnum angustilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed philodendron, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more commonly cultivated for its ornamental foliage than for its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Epipremnum angustilobum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ease of care and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
