    "intro": "Elytranthe rigida, commonly known as the rigid elytranthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Elytranthe rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and modest blooms."
