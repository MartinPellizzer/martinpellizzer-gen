    "intro": "Euterpe antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian palm, is a species of palm native to the rainforests of Colombia. It is a tall, slender palm with a single trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, followed by edible fruits that are similar to those of the a\u00e7a\u00ed palm. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
