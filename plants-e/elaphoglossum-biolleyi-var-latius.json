    "intro": "Elaphoglossum biolleyi var. latius, commonly known as the broad-leafed harts-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, narrow, tongue-shaped appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
