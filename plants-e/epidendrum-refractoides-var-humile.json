    "intro": "Epidendrum refractoides var. humile, commonly known as the miniature Epidendrum, is a compact bromeliad native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It features a short, upright stem with clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has broad, strap-like leaves that are usually green with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments. It is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. This variety is prized for its compact size and ability to bloom reliably under proper care."
