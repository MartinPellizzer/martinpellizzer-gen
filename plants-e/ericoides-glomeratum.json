    "intro": "Ericoides glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and dense clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers, typically pink or white, bloom in late spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ericoides glomeratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
