    "intro": "Eriocaulon obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tips, with a distinctive waxy coating. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces minute seeds that are dispersed by water. Eriocaulon obtusifolium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
