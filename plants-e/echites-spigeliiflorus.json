    "intro": "Echites spigeliiflorus, commonly known as the spiked-flowered echites, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with prominent, spiky bracts, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires full sun and minimal water."
