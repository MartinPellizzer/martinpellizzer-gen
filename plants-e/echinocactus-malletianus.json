    "intro": "Echinocactus malletianus, commonly known as the Mallet's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a solitary, spiny cactus with a short, thick stem and a crown of spiny, ribbed segments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched pedicels. Its structure is adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide shade and reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
