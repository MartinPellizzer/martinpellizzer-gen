    "intro": "Exostema cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf or heart-shaped fern, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, which are leaf-like bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Exostema cordatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical conditions."
