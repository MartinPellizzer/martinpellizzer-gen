    "intro": "Erigeron muralis, commonly known as the wall aster, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on walls or cliffs, and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, and the flowers range in color from white to pale purple. Erigeron muralis is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
