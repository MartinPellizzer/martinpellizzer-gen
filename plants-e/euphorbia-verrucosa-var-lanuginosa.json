    "intro": "Euphorbia verrucosa var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fine white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage, and the stems are often branched and upright. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
