    "intro": "Echinops pratensis, commonly known as the meadow thistle, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small, fuzzy balls, which are a distinguishing feature of the genus Echinops. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often thriving in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in dense clusters. Echinops pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
