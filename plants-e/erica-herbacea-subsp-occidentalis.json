    "intro": "Erica herbacea subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
