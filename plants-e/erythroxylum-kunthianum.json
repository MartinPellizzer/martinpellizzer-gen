It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the alkaloid cocaine, making it botanically significant. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and moderate rainfall. Its ecological and pharmacological importance has made it a subject of both scientific study and conservation efforts."
