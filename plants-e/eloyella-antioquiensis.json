    "intro": "Eloyella antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian eloyella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the cloud forests of Antioquia, Colombia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in the region."
