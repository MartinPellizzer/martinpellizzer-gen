    "intro": "Elymus mutabilis var. irendykensis, commonly known as the Irkutsk wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Mongolia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed glumes and spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor nutrient availability. This variant is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration and as a forage crop in arid and semi-arid regions."
