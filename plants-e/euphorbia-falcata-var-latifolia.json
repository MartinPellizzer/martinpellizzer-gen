    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system for efficient water absorption. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
