    "intro": "Erica columnaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, dense clusters of flowers. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica columnaris thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
