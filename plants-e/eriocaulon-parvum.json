    "intro": "Eriocaulon parvum, commonly known as the small spike-rush, is a diminutive aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with slender, thread-like leaves that often form dense mats in wetland environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white flowers that are typically clustered closely together. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Due to its delicate structure and specific ecological requirements, it is often found in regions with stable, moist conditions."
