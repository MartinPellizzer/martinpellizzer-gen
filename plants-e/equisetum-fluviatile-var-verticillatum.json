    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile var. verticillatum, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found near streams and ponds. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
