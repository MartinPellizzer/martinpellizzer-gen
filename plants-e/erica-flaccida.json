    "intro": "Erica flaccida, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica flaccida is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact form and long blooming period."
