It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eriospermum luteorubrum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and rocky slopes."
