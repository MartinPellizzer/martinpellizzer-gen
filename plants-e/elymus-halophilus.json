    "intro": "Elymus halophilus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in high-salt conditions, making it an important plant in coastal and inland saline soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments. Elymus halophilus plays a vital role in ecological restoration projects in saline habitats."
