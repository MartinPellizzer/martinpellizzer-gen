    "intro": "Elymus alaskanus subsp. subalpinus, commonly known as the Alaska subalpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and western Canada. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically growing in alpine tundra and subalpine meadows. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 culms (stems) that are often densely packed, forming dense vegetation mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its harsh habitat."
