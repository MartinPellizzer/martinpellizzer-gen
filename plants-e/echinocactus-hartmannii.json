It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the tips of the stems. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
