    "intro": "Erysimum alpestre var. adcumbens, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
