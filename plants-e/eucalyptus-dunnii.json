    "intro": "Eucalyptus dunnii, commonly known as the red box, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus dunnii is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional and modern applications."
