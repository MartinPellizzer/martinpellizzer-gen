    "intro": "Epidendrum retusum, commonly known as the stiff-leaf Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with distinctive red or purple markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum retusum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relative ease of care."
