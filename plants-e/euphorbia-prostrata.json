    "intro": "Euphorbia prostrata, commonly known as creeping spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white wax. Euphorbia prostrata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
