    "intro": "Ericameria parrasana, commonly known as the parrasana greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water. It is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, contributing to soil stabilization. Ericameria parrasana is also valued for its resilience and is used in ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes."
