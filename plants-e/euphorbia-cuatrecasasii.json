    "intro": "Euphorbia cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
