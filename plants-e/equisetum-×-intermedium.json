    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate horsetail, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, tooth-like structures, and it thrives in wetlands and along stream banks. Equisetum \u00d7 intermedium is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
