    "intro": "Erigeron wootonii, commonly known as Wooton's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly in the central and southern regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its flowers, which bloom in the summer, consist of ray florets that are usually white or pale yellow, surrounded by a cluster of smaller, tubular disc florets. Erigeron wootonii is often found in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
