    "intro": "Epidendrum aida-alvareziae, commonly known as the Aida Alvarez Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant prefers warm, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique genetic makeup."
