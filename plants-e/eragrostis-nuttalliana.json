It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and typically have a bluish-green color. Eragrostis nuttalliana is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides."
