It features basal rosettes of linear, glaucous leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering period is short, typically lasting only a few weeks, and it is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
