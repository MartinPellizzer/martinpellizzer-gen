    "intro": "Erica longifolia var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal landscapes."
