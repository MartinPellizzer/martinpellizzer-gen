    "intro": "Eryngium aquaticum var. normale, commonly known as water thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant features a rosette of spiny, blue-green leaves and produces purple to pinkish flower heads that resemble thistles. Its flowers are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance. The plant has also been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
