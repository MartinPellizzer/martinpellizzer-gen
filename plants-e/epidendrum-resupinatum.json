    "intro": "Epidendrum resupinatum, commonly known as the hanging pine orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with long, arching stems that bear clusters of bright green, ovate leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum resupinatum is a popular choice for hanging baskets due to its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
