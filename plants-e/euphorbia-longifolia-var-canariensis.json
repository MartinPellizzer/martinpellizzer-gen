    "intro": "Euphorbia longifolia var. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features gray-green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant."
