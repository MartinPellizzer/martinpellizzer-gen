    "intro": "Euphorbia philora, commonly known as the coral euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem covered in small, green, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange cyathia, which are its modified flower structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and collections."
