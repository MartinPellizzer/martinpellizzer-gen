    "intro": "Echinodiscus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal regions and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. They are characterized by their spiny, disc-like flower heads and succulent leaves. Echinodiscus species often have a short lifespan and are known for their ability to thrive in harsh maritime conditions. Their unique morphology makes them popular in horticulture, particularly in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
