    "intro": "Eriophorum komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wetland environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates. Eriophorum komarovii is an important component of the vegetation in polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
