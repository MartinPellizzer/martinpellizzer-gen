    "intro": "Euphorbia poliosperma, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with its pale green, fleshy stems and spiny, triangular leaves. The plant produces small yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy tissues. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens."
