    "intro": "Eragrostis densissima, commonly known as dense bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common species in prairie and dryland ecosystems. Dense bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
