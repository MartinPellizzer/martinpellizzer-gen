    "intro": "Eriophorum hudsonianum, commonly known as Hudson's cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and wet meadows. Its growth is closely tied to the short growing season of polar climates, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these harsh ecosystems. The plant's structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to extreme environmental conditions."
