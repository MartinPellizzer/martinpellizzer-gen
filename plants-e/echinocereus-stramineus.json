    "intro": "Echinocereus stramineus, commonly known as the white hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Echinocereus stramineus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
