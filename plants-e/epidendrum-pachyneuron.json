    "intro": "Epidendrum pachyneuron, commonly known as the Crimson Spike Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and slightly fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Epidendrum pachyneuron is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
