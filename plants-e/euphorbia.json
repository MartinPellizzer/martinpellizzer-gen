    "intro": "Euphorbia, commonly known as the spurge, is a diverse genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Many species of Euphorbia are succulent, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often grouped into a structure called a cyathium. Euphorbias are found in a wide range of habitats, from deserts to rainforests, and include both ornamental and medicinal species."
