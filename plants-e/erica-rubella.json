    "intro": "Erica rubella, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Erica rubella produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas."
