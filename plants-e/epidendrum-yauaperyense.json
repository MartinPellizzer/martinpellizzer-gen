    "intro": "Epidendrum yauaperyense, commonly known as the Yauap\u00e9 orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Amazon rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Epidendrum genus, which includes over 1,500 species of orchids, many of which are epiphytic. This particular species is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features make it an important component of the rainforest's biodiversity and ecological balance."
