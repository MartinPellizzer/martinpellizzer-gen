    "intro": "Eucalyptus brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale or creamy white in color. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Eucalyptus brevifolia is often found in mallee woodlands and is an important component of the local flora."
