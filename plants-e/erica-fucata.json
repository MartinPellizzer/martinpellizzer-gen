    "intro": "Erica fucata, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring and early summer. Erica fucata thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is highly tolerant of coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in coastal gardens."
