    "intro": "Eugenia nemoralis, commonly known as the rough-leaved eugenia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring dense foliage with rough, leathery leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are dark purple when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile ornamental plant in warm climates. Eugenia nemoralis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense growth habit and seasonal interest."
