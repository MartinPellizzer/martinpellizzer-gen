    "intro": "Euphorbia isophylla, commonly known as the smoothleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically smooth and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
