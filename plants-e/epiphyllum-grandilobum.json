    "intro": "Epiphyllum grandilobum, commonly known as the giant night bloomer, is a climbing cactus native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its fleshy, flat stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. Epiphyllum grandilobum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering behavior."
