It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
