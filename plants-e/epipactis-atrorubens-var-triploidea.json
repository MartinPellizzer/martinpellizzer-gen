    "intro": "Epipactis atrorubens var. triploidea, commonly known as the red-stemmed helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish stems and leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a prominent lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Epipactis atrorubens var. triploidea is often found growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
