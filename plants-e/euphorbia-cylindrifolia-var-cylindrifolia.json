    "intro": "Euphorbia cylindrifolia var. cylindrifolia, commonly known as the cylindrical spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
