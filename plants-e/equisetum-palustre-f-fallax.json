It is a perennial plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem.

It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has sterile and fertile stems that produce spores."
