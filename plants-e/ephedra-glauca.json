    "intro": "Ephedra glauca, commonly known as the blue ephedra, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and red berries, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. Ephedra glauca is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties, although its use is now regulated due to its alkaloid content."
