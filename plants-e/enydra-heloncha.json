It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has slender, branching stems that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The leaves are alternate, opposite, or whorled, and are usually small, oval, and slightly succulent. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, and its fruit is a small, elongated capsule containing several seeds. This plant is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
