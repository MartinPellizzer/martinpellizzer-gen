    "intro": "Echeveria farinosa, commonly known as the mealy echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves covered in a fine, powdery coating called farina, which gives it its common name. The plant produces tall, branching stems with clusters of pink to purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a desirable plant for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
