    "intro": "Eragrostis scabra, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Eragrostis scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
