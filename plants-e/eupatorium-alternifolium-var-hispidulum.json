    "intro": "Eupatorium alternifolium var. hispidulum, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features tall, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. Its showy, clustered yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its rough, hairy texture and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
