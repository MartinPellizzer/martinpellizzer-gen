    "intro": "Elytrigia tauri, commonly known as the Crimean grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose spike of small, two-lobed spikelets, which produce wind-pollinated flowers. Elytrigia tauri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
