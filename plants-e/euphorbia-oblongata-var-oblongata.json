    "intro": "Euphorbia oblongata var. oblongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often green or pale green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in dry landscapes."
