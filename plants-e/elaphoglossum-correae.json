It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or clustered. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It is native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. Elaphoglossum correae thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth."
