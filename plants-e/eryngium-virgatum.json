    "intro": "Eryngium virgatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistles, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in sandy or rocky habitats. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some areas. Eryngium virgatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
