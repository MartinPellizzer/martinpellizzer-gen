    "intro": "Eucalyptus umbra subsp. carnea, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. Its most striking feature is its clusters of bright red flowers, which appear in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
