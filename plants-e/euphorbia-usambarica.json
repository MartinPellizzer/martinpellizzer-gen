    "intro": "Euphorbia usambarica, commonly known as the Usambara spurge, is a flowering plant native to the East African mountains, particularly Tanzania. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
