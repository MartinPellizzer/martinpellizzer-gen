It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
