    "intro": "Euphorbia garberi, commonly known as Garber's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
