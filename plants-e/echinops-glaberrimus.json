    "intro": "Echinops glaberrimus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiky structure. Echinops glaberrimus thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
