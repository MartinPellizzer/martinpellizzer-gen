    "intro": "Eriachne, commonly known as the spear grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet with two to three bracts, which are often reduced or modified. Eriachne species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. These plants play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
