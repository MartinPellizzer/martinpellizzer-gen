    "intro": "Elaeodendron velutinum, commonly known as the velvet elaeodendron, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth texture, and its bark is rough and fissured. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
