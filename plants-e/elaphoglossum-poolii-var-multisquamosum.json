    "intro": "Elaphoglossum poolii var. multisquamosum, commonly known as the multiscaly water fern, is a delicate fern species native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with small, scaly structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories near streams or in swampy areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and the spores are released during the rainy season. This variant is distinguished by its unique scaly appearance, which provides it with a distinctive botanical identity."
