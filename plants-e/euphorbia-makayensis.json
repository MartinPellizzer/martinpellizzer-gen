    "intro": "Euphorbia makayensis, commonly known as the Makay's spurge, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique adaptations to arid environments. The plant is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and green. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
