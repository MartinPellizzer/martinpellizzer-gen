It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually small, linear, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
