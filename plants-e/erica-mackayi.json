    "intro": "Erica mackayi, commonly known as Mackay's heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Erica mackayi is evergreen and forms dense, low-growing shrubs, often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires minimal water once established."
