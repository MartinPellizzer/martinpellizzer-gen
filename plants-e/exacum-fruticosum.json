    "intro": "Exacum fruticosum, commonly known as the moss rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its foliage is typically covered in a fine, moss-like coating, which gives it its common name. Exacum fruticosum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
