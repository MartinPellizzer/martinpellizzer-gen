    "intro": "Eugenia albida, commonly known as the white eugenia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
