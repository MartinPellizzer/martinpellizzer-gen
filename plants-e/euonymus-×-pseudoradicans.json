    "intro": "Euonymus \u00d7 pseudoradicans, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ground cover and erosion control in woodland settings."
