    "intro": "Eremothera boothii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Eremothera boothii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
