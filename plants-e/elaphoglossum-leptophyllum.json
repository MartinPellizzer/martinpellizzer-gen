    "intro": "Elaphoglossum leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender-leaf holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum leptophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
