    "intro": "Ephedra distachya subvar. monostachya, commonly known as the single-stem ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems that are often branched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its stems contain alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and slow growth rates."
