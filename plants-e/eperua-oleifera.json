    "intro": "Eperua oleifera, commonly known as the oil tree or black oil tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves with elongated, leathery leaflets. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing oily seeds. These seeds are rich in oils used in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
