    "intro": "Erythrina globocalyx, commonly known as the red globular acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, globular, red seed pods that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil. Erythrina globocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
