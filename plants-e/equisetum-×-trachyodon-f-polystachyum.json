    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 trachyodon f. polystachyum, commonly known as the woolly horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum trachydon and Equisetum polystachyum. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring whorled, needle-like leaves covered in a dense layer of brown, scaly structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically clustered in a spike-like arrangement. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
