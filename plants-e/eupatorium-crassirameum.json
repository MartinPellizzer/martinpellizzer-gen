    "intro": "Eupatorium crassirameum, commonly known as roughside eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features upright stems that are often hairy and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with rough textures on both sides, and it produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers in the late summer and early fall. Eupatorium crassirameum is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can be a distinguishing characteristic."
