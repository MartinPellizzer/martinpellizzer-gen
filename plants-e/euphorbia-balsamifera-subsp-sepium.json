It is characterized by its reddish bark and smooth, often grayish-green stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its latex-like sap, which can be sticky and sometimes toxic. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions."
