    "intro": "Escobaria orcuttii, commonly known as Orcutt's liveforever, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is a succulent perennial that is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapted to its arid environment. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring. Escobaria orcuttii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
