    "intro": "Eumecanthus hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are consumed by various bird species. Its leaves are usually small, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture. Eumecanthus hoffmannii is native to parts of Australia and plays a role in the ecological interactions of its host trees and local wildlife."
