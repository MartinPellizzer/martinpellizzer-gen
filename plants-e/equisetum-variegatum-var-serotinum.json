    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum var. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering variable horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are often green with yellow or brown markings. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, typically in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it a distinctive member of the ancient plant group."
