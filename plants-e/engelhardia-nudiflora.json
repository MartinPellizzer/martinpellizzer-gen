    "intro": "Engelhardia nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower engelhardia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. These flowers are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Engelhardia nudiflora is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
