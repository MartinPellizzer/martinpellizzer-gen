    "intro": "Erica longifolia var. maritima, commonly known as the sea heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in spring, which are borne on short, erect stalks. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. Erica longifolia var. maritima is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
