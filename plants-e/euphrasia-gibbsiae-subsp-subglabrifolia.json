    "intro": "Euphrasia gibbsiae subsp. subglabrifolia, commonly known as the glandular eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are glandular and hairy, which helps in reducing water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
