    "intro": "Euphorbia schultzii var. schultzii, commonly known as the Schultze's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, which is a swollen stem base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its leaves are often small and fleshy, adapted for water conservation. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
