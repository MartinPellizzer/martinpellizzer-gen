    "intro": "Ellipeia nervosa, commonly known as the slender-veined fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous erect shoots, contributing to its spreading growth habit. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, typical of the fern life cycle."
