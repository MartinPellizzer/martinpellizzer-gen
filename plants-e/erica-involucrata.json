    "intro": "Erica involucrata, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Erica involucrata is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
