    "intro": "Eulophia euglossa, commonly known as the honey-scented orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that resemble small, intricate butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid's unique floral structure and sweet scent attract specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
