    "intro": "Elettaria paludosa, commonly known as marsh cardamom, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshy regions of countries like Thailand and Indonesia. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and have a mild, spicy flavor similar to cardamom. However, it is less commercially cultivated compared to other members of the ginger family."
