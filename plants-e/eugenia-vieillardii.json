    "intro": "Eugenia vieillardii, commonly known as the giant wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree produces small, round, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Eugenia vieillardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for landscaping purposes."
