    "intro": "Euphorbia antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
