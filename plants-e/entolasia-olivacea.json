It is characterized by its small, flattened body covered in a waxy, shield-like covering. The plant it infests is typically a member of the Oleaceae family, such as olive trees. The insect feeds on the sap of its host plant, leading to potential weakening or damage. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pest in horticultural and agricultural settings."
