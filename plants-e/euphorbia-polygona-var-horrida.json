    "intro": "Euphorbia polygona var. horrida, commonly known as the rough-stemmed spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, branching stems covered in a layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small, oval, and covered in a similar waxy coating. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
