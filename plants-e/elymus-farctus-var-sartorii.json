    "intro": "Elymus farctus var. sartorii, commonly known as the broad-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its robust,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
