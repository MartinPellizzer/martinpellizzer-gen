    "intro": "Eucalyptus brevipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Eucalyptus brevipes is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
