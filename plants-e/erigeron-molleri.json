    "intro": "Erigeron molleri, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Its blue to violet flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Erigeron molleri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
