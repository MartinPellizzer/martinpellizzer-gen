    "intro": "Echites rosacampestris, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Echites rosacampestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
