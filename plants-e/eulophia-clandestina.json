    "intro": "Eulophia clandestina, commonly known as the hidden eulophia, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a challenging species for cultivation."
