    "intro": "Elymus viridulus, commonly known as green false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus viridulus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
