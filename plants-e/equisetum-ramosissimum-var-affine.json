    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. affine, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a species of horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically clustered in a dense, spike-like structure. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is closely related to other horsetail species and is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
