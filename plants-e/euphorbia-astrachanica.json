    "intro": "Euphorbia astrachanica, commonly known as the Astrachan euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Central Asia. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a shallow root system adapted to sandy or rocky soils. Euphorbia astrachanica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
