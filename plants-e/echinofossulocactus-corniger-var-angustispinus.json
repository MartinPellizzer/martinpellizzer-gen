    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus corniger var. angustispinus, commonly known as the narrow-spined corniger cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white flowers. The plant has a slow growth rate and is typically found in rocky, arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, elongated fruits that are edible. This variant is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
