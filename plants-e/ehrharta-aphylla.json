    "intro": "Ehrharta aphylla, commonly known as the hairless grass or Indian grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its lack of hairy leaves gives it a smooth, glossy appearance, and it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening. Ehrharta aphylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
