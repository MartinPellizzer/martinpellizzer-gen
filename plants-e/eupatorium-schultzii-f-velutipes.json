    "intro": "Eupatorium schultzii f. velutipes, commonly known as the velvet eupatorium, is a variant of the eupatorium plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, producing clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological distinctiveness within the Eupatorium genus, particularly in its dense pubescence and ecological preferences."
