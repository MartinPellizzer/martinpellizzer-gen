    "intro": "Effusiella bertoniensis, commonly known as the Bertoni's effuse fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, soft green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid tropical or subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Effusiella bertoniensis is considered a vulnerable species."
