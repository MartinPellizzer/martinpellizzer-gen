    "intro": "Entada obliqua, commonly known as the \"Brazillian horse chestnut,\" is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, red-and-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, woody pods containing hard, angular seeds. Its bark and seeds contain compounds used in traditional medicine, though they are toxic in high doses. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is often found in humid lowland forests."
