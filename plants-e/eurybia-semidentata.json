    "intro": "Eurybia semidentata, commonly known as the eastern wood aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has dark green, alternate leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. Eurybia semidentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
