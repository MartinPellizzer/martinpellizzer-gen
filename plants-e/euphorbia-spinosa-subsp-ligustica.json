    "intro": "Euphorbia spinosa subsp. ligustica, commonly known as the Ligustic Spiny Euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
