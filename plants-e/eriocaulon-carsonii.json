    "intro": "Eriocaulon carsonii, commonly known as Carson's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of the United States. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Its botanical features include fine, hair-like structures on the leaves and stems, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Eriocaulon carsonii is often found in wetland or moist soil environments, reflecting its hydrophytic adaptations."
