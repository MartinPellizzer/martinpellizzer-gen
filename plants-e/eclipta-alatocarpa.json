    "intro": "Eclipta alatocarpa, commonly known as iron cross, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm, featuring erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, flat-topped cluster, which bloom from summer to autumn. Its seeds are enclosed in a pungent, fleshy capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Eclipta alatocarpa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
