    "intro": "Epidendrum tachirense, commonly known as the Tachira Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
