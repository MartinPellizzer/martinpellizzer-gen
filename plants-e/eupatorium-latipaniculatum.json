    "intro": "Eupatorium latipaniculatum, commonly known as broad-leaved boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, panicle-like clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. These flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
