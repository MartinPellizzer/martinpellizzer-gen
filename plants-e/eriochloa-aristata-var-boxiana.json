It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with blue or purple. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form dense stands. This species is important for soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
