    "intro": "Epidendrum refractoides, commonly known as the Refractoides Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
