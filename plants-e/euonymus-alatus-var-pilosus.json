    "intro": "Euonymus alatus var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy-winged burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems that are covered in fine, hairy texture, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its seasonal color changes and architectural form."
