    "intro": "Eriophyton anomalum, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a stout trunk and narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils with minimal rainfall. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a living fossil and a subject of significant botanical interest."
