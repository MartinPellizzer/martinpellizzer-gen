    "intro": "Eriotheca sclerophylla, commonly known as the rigid-leaved eriotheca, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of hair, providing additional protection against desiccation. Eriotheca sclerophylla is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
