It typically grows to a height of 5\u20138 meters and features elliptical, dark green leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest for both ecological and horticultural studies."
