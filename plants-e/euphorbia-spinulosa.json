    "intro": "Euphorbia spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
