    "intro": "Erigeron \u00d7 pseudocrispus, commonly known as the Blue Mistflower, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It features silver-gray foliage and produces fluffy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous tiny florets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
