    "intro": "Euphorbia consanguinea, commonly known as the blood euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves. The plant produces a unique type of inflorescence called a cyathium, which contains both male and female flowers. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
