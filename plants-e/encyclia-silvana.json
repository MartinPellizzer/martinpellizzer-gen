    "intro": "Encyclia silvana, commonly known as the silvan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Encyclia silvana thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and ecological studies."
