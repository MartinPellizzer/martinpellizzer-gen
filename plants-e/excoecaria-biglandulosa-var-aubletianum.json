    "intro": "Excoecaria biglandulosa var. aubletianum, commonly known as the African rubber plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, which are edible but should be consumed with caution. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its rubbery sap has been historically used in traditional medicine and for making rubber products."
