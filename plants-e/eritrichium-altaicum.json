    "intro": "Eritrichium altaicum, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate blue or purple flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its small stature and vibrant blooms make it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems. Eritrichium altaicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
