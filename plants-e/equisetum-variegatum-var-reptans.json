    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically greenish-yellow in color, with a distinctive whorl of small, scale-like leaves at each node. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are often hidden beneath the soil surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. This variety is known for its creeping growth habit, spreading along the ground through rhizomes to form dense colonies."
