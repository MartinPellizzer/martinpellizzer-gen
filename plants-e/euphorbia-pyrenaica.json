    "intro": "Euphorbia pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Euphorbia pyrenaica is also known for its milky latex sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
