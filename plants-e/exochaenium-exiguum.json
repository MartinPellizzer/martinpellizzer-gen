    "intro": "Exochaenium exiguum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a small, annual grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
