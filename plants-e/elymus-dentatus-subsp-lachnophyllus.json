    "intro": "Elymus dentatus subsp. lachnophyllus, commonly known as the hairy-leaved wild rye, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its subspecific name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, with lemma-like bracts that are often hairy. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
