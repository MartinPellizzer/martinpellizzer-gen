    "intro": "Epidendrum tigriphyllum, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant, showy flowers with a striking red and yellow coloration, often resembling a tiger's stripes. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces numerous small, fragrant flowers along its inflorescence, which can bloom multiple times a year. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
