    "intro": "Equilabium candelabriforme, commonly known as the candlestick lily, is a striking plant characterized by its tall, branched stem that resembles a candlestick. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is native to South America, particularly Chile. The plant features large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, adding a dramatic visual effect to its structure. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. This unique combination of form and floral display makes it a prized ornamental plant in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
