    "intro": "Euphorbia genistoides var. corifolia, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has fleshy, ribbed stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is not typically used in medicinal applications."
