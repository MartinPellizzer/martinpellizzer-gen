    "intro": "Euphorbia deltoidea var. serpyllum, commonly known as the arrowleaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
