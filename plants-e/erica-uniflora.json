    "intro": "Erica uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late summer. Erica uniflora thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region, with drought-resistant properties."
