    "intro": "Echinocereus pentalophus var. procumbens, commonly known as the lowland prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems that are covered in clusters of bright green, spiny pads. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its foliage is adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy cuticles that reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscapic gardens."
