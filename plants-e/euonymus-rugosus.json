    "intro": "Euonymus rugosus, commonly known as the roughleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive orange-red berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant seasonal color changes and compact growth habit. Euonymus rugosus is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and visual appeal."
