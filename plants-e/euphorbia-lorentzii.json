    "intro": "Euphorbia lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution. Euphorbia lorentzii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
