    "intro": "Epidendrum tambillense, commonly known as the Tambillense orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid and shaded environments. The plant features long, linear leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and gardens."
