    "intro": "Echinus nesophilus, commonly known as the alpine hollyhock, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spiny, globe-shaped seed pods that resemble a sea urchin, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with poor soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Echinus nesophilus is considered a vulnerable species."
