    "intro": "Ericoides penicillatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, contributing to its dense, mat-like growth habit. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in early spring. Ericoides penicillatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
