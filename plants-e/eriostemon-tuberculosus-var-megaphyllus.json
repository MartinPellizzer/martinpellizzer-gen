    "intro": "Eriostemon tuberculosus var. megaphyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf eriostemon, is a perennial shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Its leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variant is notable for its larger foliage compared to other varieties within the Eriostemon genus."
