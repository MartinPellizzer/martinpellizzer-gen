    "intro": "Eremophila appressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces spikes of pink to red flowers, typically in spring, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate drought, making it a hardy component of native vegetation. Eremophila appressa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its natural environment."
