    "intro": "Echium australe var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the Australian giant flowering plant, is a perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal and sandy habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
