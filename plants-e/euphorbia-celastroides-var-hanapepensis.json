    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. hanapepensis, commonly known as the Hanapepe euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
