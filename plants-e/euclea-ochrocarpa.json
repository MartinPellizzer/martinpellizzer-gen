It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands and along riverbanks. Euclea ochrocarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
