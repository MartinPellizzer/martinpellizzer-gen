It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plants typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. Einomeria species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
