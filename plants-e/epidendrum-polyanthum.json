    "intro": "Epidendrum polyanthum, commonly known as the orchid with many flowers, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences that produce numerous small, colorful flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Epidendrum polyanthum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
