    "intro": "Epigeneium speculum, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a protective shield over its roots, which helps retain moisture. The plant has a short, unbranched stem with a single, fleshy rhizome. Its leaves are typically dark green with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in rainforests."
