    "intro": "Eleusine jaegeri var. maxima, commonly known as giant lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
