    "intro": "Eremophila latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to poor soils and can withstand prolonged drought periods. Eremophila latifolia is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
