    "intro": "Empetrum hermaphroditum, commonly known as snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it a resilient and ecologically significant species."
