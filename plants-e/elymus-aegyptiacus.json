    "intro": "Elymus aegyptiacus, commonly known as the Egyptian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Middle East and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils. Elymus aegyptiacus is valued for its resilience and has been used in traditional agriculture and forage production."
