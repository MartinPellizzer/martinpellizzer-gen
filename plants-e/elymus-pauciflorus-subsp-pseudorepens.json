    "intro": "Elymus pauciflorus subsp. pseudorepens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, narrow lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
