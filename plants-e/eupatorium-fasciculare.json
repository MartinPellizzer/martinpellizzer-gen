    "intro": "Eupatorium fasciculare, commonly known as narrowleaf boneset, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowering period occurs in the summer months. Eupatorium fasciculare is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
