    "intro": "Epidendrum paleaceum, commonly known as the Paleaceum Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, arching stems with numerous oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, elongated shape and a pleasant fragrance. Epidendrum paleaceum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
