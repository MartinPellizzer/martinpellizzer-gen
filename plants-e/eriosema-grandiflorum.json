It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that give it a rough texture. Eriosema grandiflorum is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils."
