    "intro": "Elionurus muticus var. barbiculmis, commonly known as the barbed hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive barbed awns on the lemma, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, producing small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and its potential for use in restoration projects."
