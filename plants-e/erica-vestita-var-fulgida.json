    "intro": "Erica vestita var. fulgida, commonly known as the golden heath, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically yellow or orange in color, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
