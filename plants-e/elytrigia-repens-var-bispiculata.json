    "intro": "Elytrigia repens var. bispiculata, commonly known as the two-tailed meadow grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands, often forming dense mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two distinct bracts at the base of each flower. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
