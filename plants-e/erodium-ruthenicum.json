    "intro": "Erodium ruthenicum, commonly known as the Russian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Erodium ruthenicum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
