    "intro": "Echinospermum sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessileflower sunhemp, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems that often bear small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive spiny seed pods. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine. Echinospermum sessiliflorum is also valued for its potential in soil conservation and as a forage crop."
