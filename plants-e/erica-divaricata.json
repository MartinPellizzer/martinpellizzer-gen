    "intro": "Erica divaricata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica divaricata is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
