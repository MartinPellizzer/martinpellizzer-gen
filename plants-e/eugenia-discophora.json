    "intro": "Eugenia discophora, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red mangosteen, is a small evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they are not as well-known as the mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana). Eugenia discophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native habitat."
