It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces a distinctive fruit with a star-shaped calyx, which turns from green to yellow as it ripens. The fruit is edible, with a sweet, juicy pulp that has a mild, aromatic flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food in its native regions."
