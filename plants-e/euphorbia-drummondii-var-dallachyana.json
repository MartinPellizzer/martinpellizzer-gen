    "intro": "Euphorbia drummondii var. dallachyana, commonly known as the Dallachy's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a shallow root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
