    "intro": "Exocarpos floribundus, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces clusters of small, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it blooms profusely during the winter months. The fruit is edible for some animals but is generally not consumed by humans due to its bitter taste."
