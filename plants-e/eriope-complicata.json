    "intro": "Eriope complicata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian velvetleaf, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Eriope complicata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or wetlands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ornamental and ecological studies."
