    "intro": "Elatostema celingense, commonly known as the velvetleaf stellaria, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. Elatostema celingense is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
