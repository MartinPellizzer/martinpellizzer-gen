    "intro": "Euonymus verrucosus f. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered woodbine, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are ornamental and attract wildlife. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in woodland gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
