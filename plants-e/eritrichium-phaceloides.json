    "intro": "Eritrichium phaceloides, commonly known as the purple alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of violet or purple blooms. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in open meadows and is adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions."
