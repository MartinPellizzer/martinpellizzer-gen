    "intro": "Epidendrum longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and relatively large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum longipes is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
