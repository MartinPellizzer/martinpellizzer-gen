It is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Epidendroideae subfamily, characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests."
