    "intro": "Eragrostis bagdadensis, commonly known as Baghdad grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
