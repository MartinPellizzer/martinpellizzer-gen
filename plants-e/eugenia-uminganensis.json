    "intro": "Eugenia uminganensis, commonly known as the Umingan hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Luzon, where it grows in lowland and montane forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that is edible and often consumed by local communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
