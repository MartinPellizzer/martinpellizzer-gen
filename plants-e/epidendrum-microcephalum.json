    "intro": "Epidendrum microcephalum, commonly known as the miniature helmet orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features small, compact pseudobulbs and produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts. Its unique appearance and manageable size make it an attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens."
