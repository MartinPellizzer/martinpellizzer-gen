    "intro": "Epilobium tetragonum subsp. tetragonum, commonly known as the four-angle willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, angular stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it both ecologically important and a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
