    "intro": "Echinus mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads that resemble a sea urchin. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to salty, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echinus mathewsii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
