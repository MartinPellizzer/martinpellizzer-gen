    "intro": "Elaphoglossum vascoae, commonly known as the Vasco's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. This plant is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Elaphoglossum vascoae has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce small, clustered sporangia. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject in the study of fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
