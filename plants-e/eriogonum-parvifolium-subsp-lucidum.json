    "intro": "Eriogonum parvifolium subsp. lucidum, commonly known as the shining buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to arid environments."
