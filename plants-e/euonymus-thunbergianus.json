    "intro": "Euonymus thunbergianus, commonly known as the Japanese spindle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, inflated fruits that split open to reveal seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes make it a visually striking addition to landscapes."
