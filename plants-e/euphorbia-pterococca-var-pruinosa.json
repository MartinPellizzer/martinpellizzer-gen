    "intro": "Euphorbia pterococca var. pruinosa, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
