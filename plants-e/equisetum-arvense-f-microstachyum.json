    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. microstachyum, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically smaller than those of the typical species. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. This fern-like plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
