    "intro": "Eriogonum polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leafed buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with multiple stems and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Eriogonum polyphyllum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a common component of chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
