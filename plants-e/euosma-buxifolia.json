    "intro": "Euosma buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf euosma, is a species of flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Euosma buxifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its foliage provides year-round visual interest, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
