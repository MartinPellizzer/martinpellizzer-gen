    "intro": "Eucalyptus chapmaniana, commonly known as the Chapman's gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, yellow, and red. The plant produces creamy-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Eucalyptus chapmaniana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
