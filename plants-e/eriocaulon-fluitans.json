    "intro": "Eriocaulon fluitans, commonly known as floating rice grass, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as rice paddies and wetlands. The plant has slender, floating stems that bear tiny, clustered spikelets, which are its reproductive structures. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while the upper stems remain afloat. Eriocaulon fluitans plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for microorganisms."
