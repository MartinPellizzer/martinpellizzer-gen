    "intro": "Enchylus, commonly known as the white spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and its simple, alternate leaves. The flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Enchylus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They are often used in traditional medicine, though their toxicity requires caution in handling and use."
