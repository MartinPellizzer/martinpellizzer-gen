    "intro": "Epimedium planipetalum, commonly known as the barrenwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to China. It features distinctive, leathery, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, reddish stems. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Epimedium planipetalum is valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to naturalize in shaded areas."
