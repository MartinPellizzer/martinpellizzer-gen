    "intro": "Eriogonum prattenianum, commonly known as the Pratten's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum prattenianum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
