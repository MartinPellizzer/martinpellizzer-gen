    "intro": "Ephedra fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in small, branched inflorescences. Ephedra fasciculata is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Its historical use in traditional medicine has led to increased interest in its chemical properties."
