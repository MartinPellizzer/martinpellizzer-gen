    "intro": "Erysimum drabiforme, commonly known as the woolly wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense covering of soft, white hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Erysimum drabiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, rocky conditions."
