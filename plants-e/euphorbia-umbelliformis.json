    "intro": "Euphorbia umbelliformis, commonly known as the umbrella euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with a rosette of fleshy, spiny leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its unique morphology and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
