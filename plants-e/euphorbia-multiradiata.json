    "intro": "Euphorbia multiradiata, commonly known as the radiate spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching stem covered in spiny, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
