    "intro": "Eriotheca crenulaticalyx, commonly known as the hairy calyx eriotheca, is a species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy calyx that persists on the fruit, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin. The flowers are small and clustered, with white or pale yellow petals, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds."
