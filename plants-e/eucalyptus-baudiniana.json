    "intro": "Eucalyptus baudiniana, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that is typically grey or pale brown in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-blue hue due to their dense covering of fine hairs. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green to yellow in color. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in woodland and shrubland habitats."
