    "intro": "Eremocitrus, commonly known as the desert citrus or desert lime, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their small, citrus-like fruits that are typically yellow or green. The leaves are usually narrow and evergreen, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Eremocitrus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and their ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
