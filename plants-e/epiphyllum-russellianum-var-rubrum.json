    "intro": "Epiphyllum russellianum var. rubrum, commonly known as the Ruby Nightshade, is a striking cactus-like plant native to Central America. It is a perennial species that typically grows on trees or rocks, using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often adorned with vibrant red or pink flowers during the night. Its leaves are usually present in the juvenile stage but are shed as the plant matures. The flowers are ephemeral, blooming only for a short period before wilting, making it a rare and captivating sight in the botanical world."
