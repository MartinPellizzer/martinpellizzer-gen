    "intro": "Egenolfia appendiculata var. subintegra, commonly known as the smooth-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its botanical structure includes a creeping rhizome system that helps it spread and establish in harsh conditions. The variety subintegra is distinguished by its smooth, less lobed leaves compared to other varieties of Egenolfia appendiculata."
