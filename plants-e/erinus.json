    "intro": "Erinus, commonly known as frostweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. These plants are native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where they thrive in rocky and dry environments. Erinus species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The foliage is typically narrow and evergreen, providing year-round visual interest. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
