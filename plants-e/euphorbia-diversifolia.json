    "intro": "Euphorbia diversifolia, commonly known as the variegated spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, thick leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters known as cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
