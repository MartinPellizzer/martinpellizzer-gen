    "intro": "Espeletia murilloi subsp. subcoriacea, commonly known as the \"P\u00e1ramo Espeletia,\" is a unique plant species native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against the cold and strong winds of its high-altitude habitat. The plant typically grows in open, rocky areas and is adapted to low temperatures and high solar radiation. Its subcoriaceous leaves are thick and leathery, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
