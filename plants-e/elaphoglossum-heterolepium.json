    "intro": "Elaphoglossum heterolepium, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum heterolepium is a relatively small fern, with fronds that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters."
