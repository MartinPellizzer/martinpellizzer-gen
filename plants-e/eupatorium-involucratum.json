It is characterized by its showy, blue-to-purple flower heads that resemble mist, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Eupatorium involucratum is a valuable plant for attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
