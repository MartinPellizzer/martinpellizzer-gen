    "intro": "Elymus intermedius, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its stems, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairie and steppe environments. Elymus intermedius is valued for its ecological benefits, including erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock."
