    "intro": "Exostema floribundum, commonly known as the flowering exostema, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
