    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus vanderaeyi var. ignotus-longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to a small region in South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spines that are both long and dense, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
