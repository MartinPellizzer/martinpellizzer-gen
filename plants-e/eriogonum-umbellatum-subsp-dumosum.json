It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert and scrubland habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
