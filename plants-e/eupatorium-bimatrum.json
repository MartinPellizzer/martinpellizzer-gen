    "intro": "Eupatorium bimatrum, commonly known as the clustered boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Eupatorium bimatrum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
