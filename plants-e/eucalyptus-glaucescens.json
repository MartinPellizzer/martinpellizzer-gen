    "intro": "Eucalyptus glaucescens, commonly known as the silver ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish or greyish hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. The plant is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
