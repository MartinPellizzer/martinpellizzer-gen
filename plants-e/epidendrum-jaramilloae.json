    "intro": "Epidendrum jaramilloae, commonly known as the Jaramillo's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps in moisture retention. Epidendrum jaramilloae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
