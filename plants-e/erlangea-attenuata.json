    "intro": "Erlangea attenuata, commonly known as the slender erlangia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular corolla, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
