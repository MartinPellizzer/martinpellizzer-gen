    "intro": "Euphorbia tithymaloides subsp. parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic euphorbia, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often as a secondary parasite on shrubs or trees. Its flowers are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Euphorbia. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing host plant populations and providing resources for certain insects and animals."
