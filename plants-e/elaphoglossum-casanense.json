    "intro": "Elaphoglossum casanense, commonly known as the Casanense holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a slightly glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum casanense is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare fern species in the wild."
