    "intro": "Echeveria montana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces vibrant purple or red flowers during the spring and summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
