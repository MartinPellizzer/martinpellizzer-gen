It is characterized by its unique, spiny, oval-shaped fruit that resembles a miniature horned melon. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
