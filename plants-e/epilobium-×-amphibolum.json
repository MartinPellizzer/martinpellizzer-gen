    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 amphibolum, commonly known as the water plantain, is a hybrid species belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Epilobium \u00d7 amphibolum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
