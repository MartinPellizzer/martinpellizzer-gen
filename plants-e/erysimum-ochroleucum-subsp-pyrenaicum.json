It typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces racemes of bright yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are characterized by four petals, with the lower petal being notably larger and spurred. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
