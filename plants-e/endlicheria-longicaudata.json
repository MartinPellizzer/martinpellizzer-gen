    "intro": "Endlicheria longicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Endlicheria longicaudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
