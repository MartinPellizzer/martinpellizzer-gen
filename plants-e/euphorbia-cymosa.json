    "intro": "Euphorbia cymosa, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Euphorbia cymosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
