It is characterized by its simple, often hairy leaves and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces inflorescences with numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are typically fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the soil. Epidendrum nudum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
