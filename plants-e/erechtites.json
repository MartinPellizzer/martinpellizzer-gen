    "intro": "Erechtites, commonly known as cup plants, are flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. They are native to North America and are characterized by their tall, branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. These plants are often found in wet or moist soils, growing along stream banks and in marshy areas. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
