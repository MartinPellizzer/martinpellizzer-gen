    "intro": "Encholirium pedicellatum, commonly known as the Mexican sun cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly spines that help reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
