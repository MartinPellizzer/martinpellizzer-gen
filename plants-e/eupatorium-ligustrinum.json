    "intro": "Eupatorium ligustrinum, commonly known as white boneset, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. Eupatorium ligustrinum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
