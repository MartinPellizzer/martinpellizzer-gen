    "intro": "Echites circinalis var. bifidus, commonly known as the bifid thornapple, is a variant of the thornapple plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive bifid (split) leaves and spiny stems, which contribute to its defensive adaptations. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, greenish fruits. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in the understory of tropical forests, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
