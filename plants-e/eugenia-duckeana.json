    "intro": "Eugenia duckeana, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces dark purple, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. Eugenia duckeana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture in warm climates."
