It is characterized by its striking, bright red, flame-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant has pinnate leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its bark is often rough and fissured. Erythrina horrida is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often used in traditional medicine. It also serves as a food source for various insects and birds."
