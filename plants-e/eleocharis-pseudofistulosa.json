    "intro": "Eleocharis pseudofistulosa, commonly known as the false rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed wetland areas. The leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often waterlogged habitat."
