    "intro": "Eugenia divaricata var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval-leaved guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pink to red berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit yield. The varietal form 'ovalis' is distinguished by its more elongated, oval-shaped leaves compared to the typical variety."
