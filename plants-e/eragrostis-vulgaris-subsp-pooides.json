    "intro": "Eragrostis vulgaris subsp. pooides, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
