    "intro": "Eupatorium asperrimum f. pauciflorum, commonly known as the rough eupatorium, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, rough stems and opposite, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited flower production, it is considered a rare and less common variant within the Eupatorium genus."
