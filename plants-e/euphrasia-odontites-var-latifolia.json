    "intro": "Euphrasia odontites var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved toothwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like leaves that are broad and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitats."
