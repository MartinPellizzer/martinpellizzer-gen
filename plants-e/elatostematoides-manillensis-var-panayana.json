    "intro": "Elatostematoides manillensis var. panayana, commonly known as the Panay flat moss, is a rare and specialized species of liverwort found in specific tropical regions. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that grows on shaded, moist substrates. The plant exhibits a complex arrangement of chlorophyll-containing cells, enabling photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Its morphology includes distinct leaf-like structures and specialized reproductive organs, typical of liverworts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora and conservation efforts."
