    "intro": "Elaphrium, commonly known as the \"buttercup grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Elaphrium species are generally herbaceous and have a fibrous root system. They play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
