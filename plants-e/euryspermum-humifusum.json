    "intro": "Euryspermum humifusum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features a low-growing habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are bell-shaped, usually blue or violet, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lanceolate, hairy, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
