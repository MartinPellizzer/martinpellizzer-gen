    "intro": "Echinocactus submammulosus, commonly known as the Mexican horsehair cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered with a thick layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
