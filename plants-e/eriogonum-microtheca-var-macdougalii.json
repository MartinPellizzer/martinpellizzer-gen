    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca var. macdougalii, commonly known as the MacDougal's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and chaparral areas. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
