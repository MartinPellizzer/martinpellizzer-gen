    "intro": "Elatine americana, commonly known as American waterwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has whorled leaves that are often less than 1 inch long, and it produces small, green flowers that are usually submerged or floating. Its stems are slender and branched, with small, oval-shaped leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. Elatine americana is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to water quality and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
