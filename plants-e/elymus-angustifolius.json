    "intro": "Elymus angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescence, which typically consists of small, two-rowed flowers. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Elymus angustifolius is also valued for its forage qualities and has been used in ecological restoration projects."
