It is characterized by its large, fleshy, tuberous roots that resemble the foot of an elephant, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually hairy and can be either basal or alternate, depending on the species. Elephantopus species are often used in traditional medicine and are also cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance."
