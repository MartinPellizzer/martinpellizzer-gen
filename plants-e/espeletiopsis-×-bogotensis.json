    "intro": "Espeletiopsis \u00d7 bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 cycad, is a hybrid cycad species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Colombia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
