    "intro": "Eschweilera bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Andes mountains of Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, typically growing in humid, cool climates at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its fruits are small, round berries that contain seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
