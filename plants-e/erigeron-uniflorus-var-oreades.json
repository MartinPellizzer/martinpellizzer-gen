    "intro": "Erigeron uniflorus var. oreades, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of blue and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh alpine environment. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
