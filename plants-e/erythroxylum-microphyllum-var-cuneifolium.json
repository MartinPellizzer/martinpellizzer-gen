    "intro": "Erythroxylum microphyllum var. cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coca, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves contain alkaloids, including cocaine, which has made it a subject of both botanical and legal interest. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is closely monitored in many countries."
