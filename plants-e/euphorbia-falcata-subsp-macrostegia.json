    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata subsp. macrostegia, commonly known as the broad-stemmed spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by specialized leaves called bracts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas."
