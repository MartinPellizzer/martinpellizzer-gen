It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
