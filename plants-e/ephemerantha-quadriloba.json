It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant is named for its short lifespan and the four-lobed structure of its leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
