    "intro": "Epidendrum ovale, commonly known as the Orchid of the Sun, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of bright yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elliptical and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Epidendrum ovale is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
