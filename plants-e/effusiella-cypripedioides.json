    "intro": "Effusiella cypripedioides, commonly known as the orchid-flower fern, is a unique member of the fern family with a distinctive appearance. It features delicate, spirally arranged fronds that resemble the petals of an orchid, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
