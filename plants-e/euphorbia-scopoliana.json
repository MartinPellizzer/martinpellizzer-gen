    "intro": "Euphorbia scopoliana, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown as an ornamental plant."
