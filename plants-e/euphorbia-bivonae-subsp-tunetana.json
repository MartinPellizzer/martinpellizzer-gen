It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
