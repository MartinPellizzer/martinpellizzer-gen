    "intro": "Encelia microphylla, commonly known as the brittlebush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal and desert regions. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to dry conditions. Encelia microphylla plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
