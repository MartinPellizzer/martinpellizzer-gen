    "intro": "Epigynum, commonly known as a type of floral structure, refers to the fusion of the ovary with other floral parts such as the petals and stamens. This characteristic is typically found in certain plant families, including the Solanaceae and Rosaceae. In epigynous flowers, the ovary is positioned below the insertion point of the petals and stamens, which is in contrast to hypogynous flowers. The epigynous arrangement can influence pollination mechanisms and seed dispersal strategies. This botanical feature plays a key role in the reproductive biology of these plant species."
