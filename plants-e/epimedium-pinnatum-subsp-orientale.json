    "intro": "Epimedium pinnatum subsp. orientale, commonly known as the oriental barrenwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, leafless stalks. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soils, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and early blooming habit, which adds interest to the garden in late winter and early spring."
