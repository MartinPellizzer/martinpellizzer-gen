    "intro": "Echinocactus macrothele var. biglandulosus, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, branched inflorescences. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. This variety is particularly noted for its distinctive, large, and widely spaced spines, which give it its common name."
