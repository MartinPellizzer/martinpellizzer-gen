    "intro": "Eylesia, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-colored fruits containing seeds. Eylesia thrives in coastal areas, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. Its root system plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in tidal zones."
