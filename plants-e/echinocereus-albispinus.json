    "intro": "Echinocereus albispinus, commonly known as the white-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
