    "intro": "Ervum calcaratum, commonly known as the rock vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Ervum calcaratum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
