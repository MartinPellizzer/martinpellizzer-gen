    "intro": "Elaphoglossum humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sorus. Its unique appearance and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
