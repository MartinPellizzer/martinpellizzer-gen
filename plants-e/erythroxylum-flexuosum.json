    "intro": "Erythroxylum flexuosum, commonly known as the creeping or trailing copal tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or ground covers. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a waxy texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in racemes. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds, and it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage."
