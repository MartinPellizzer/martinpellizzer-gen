    "intro": "Eriogonum polycladon var. mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
