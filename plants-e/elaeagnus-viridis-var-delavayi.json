    "intro": "Elaeagnus viridis var. delavayi, commonly known as the silver leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and southern China. It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Elaeagnus viridis var. delavayi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
