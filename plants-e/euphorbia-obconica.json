    "intro": "Euphorbia obconica, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
