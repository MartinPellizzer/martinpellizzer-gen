    "intro": "Eriocaulon mutatum, commonly known as the variable spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. The plant is native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitats. Eriocaulon mutatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
