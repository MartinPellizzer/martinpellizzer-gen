    "intro": "Eugenia heyneana var. alternans, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive adaptations to aquatic environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. This species is commonly found in coastal areas and estuaries, playing a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting marine biodiversity."
