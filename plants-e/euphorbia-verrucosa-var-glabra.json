    "intro": "Euphorbia verrucosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, woody stem covered in a smooth, pale green or grayish bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
