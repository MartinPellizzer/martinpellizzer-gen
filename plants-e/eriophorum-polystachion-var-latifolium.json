    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that contain numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its leaves are typically broader than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinct appearance. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
