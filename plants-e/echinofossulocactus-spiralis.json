    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral echinofossulocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of cylindrical stems, which are ribbed and covered in white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
