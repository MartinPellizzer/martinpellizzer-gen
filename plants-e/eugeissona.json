    "intro": "Eugeissona, commonly known as the golden bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of two species, Eugeissona torulosa and Eugeissona paniculata, both native to the southeastern United States. These shrubs are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, often with a waxy coating. Eugeissona plants prefer acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in woodland or scrub habitats."
