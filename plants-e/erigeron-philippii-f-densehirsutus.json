    "intro": "Erigeron philippii f. densehirsutus, commonly known as the dense-hirsute fleabane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features dense, white to pale blue ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, hairy pubescence. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in regions with full sun exposure. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators and contributes to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
