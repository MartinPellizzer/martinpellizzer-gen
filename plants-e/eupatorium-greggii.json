    "intro": "Eupatorium greggii, commonly known as Gregg's boneset, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled spheres that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Eupatorium greggii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
