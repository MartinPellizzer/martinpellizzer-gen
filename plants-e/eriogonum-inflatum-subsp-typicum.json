    "intro": "Eriogonum inflatum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces inflated, papery bracts that enclose the flowers, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
