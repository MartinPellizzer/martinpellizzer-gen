    "intro": "Eremophila alternifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
