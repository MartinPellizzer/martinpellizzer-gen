    "intro": "Eucalyptus opaca, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Eucalyptus opaca produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing small seeds. It is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
