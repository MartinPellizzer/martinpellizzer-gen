    "intro": "Everistia vacciniifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf everistia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking red to purple leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
