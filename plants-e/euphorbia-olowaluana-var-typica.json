    "intro": "Euphorbia olowaluana var. typica, commonly known as Olowalu euphorbia, is a succulent native to the Hawaiian island of Moloka\u02bbi. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited to arid and rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
