    "intro": "Echium mogadorense, commonly known as the Canary Island fleur-de-lis, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a flowering plant in the borage family, characterized by its tall, spiny stems and vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Echium mogadorense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils."
