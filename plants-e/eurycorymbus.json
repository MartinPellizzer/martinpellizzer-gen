    "intro": "Eurycorymbus, commonly known as the broad-fruit tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, which includes palms. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines, and its trunk is typically unbranched with a smooth, grayish bark. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, several species within this genus are currently threatened with extinction."
