    "intro": "Elymus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear few flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. Elymus pauciflorus is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
