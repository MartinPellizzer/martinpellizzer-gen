    "intro": "Eucalyptus crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pale yellow, and it is commonly found in dry, sandy soils. Eucalyptus crassifolia is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitat."
