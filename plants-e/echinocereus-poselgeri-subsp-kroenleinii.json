It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its compact size and distinctive appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
