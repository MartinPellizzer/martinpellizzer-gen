    "intro": "Euphorbia przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Euphorbia przewalskii is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
