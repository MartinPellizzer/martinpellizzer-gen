The plant features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Erysimum patisiliquum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in harsh, high-altitude environments."
