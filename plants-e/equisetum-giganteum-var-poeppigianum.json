    "intro": "Equisetum giganteum var. poeppigianum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, segmented stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are arranged in whorls. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. This ancient plant is notable for its lack of true leaves and its primitive vascular system."
