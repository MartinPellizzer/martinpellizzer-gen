    "intro": "Entandrophragma cylindricum, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its straight grain and high density, making it highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. The wood is resistant to decay and insect attack, which contributes to its use in furniture, construction, and musical instruments."
