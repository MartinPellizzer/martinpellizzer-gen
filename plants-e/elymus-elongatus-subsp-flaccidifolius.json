    "intro": "Elymus elongatus subsp. flaccidifolius, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically shorter and more flexible than those of the main species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
