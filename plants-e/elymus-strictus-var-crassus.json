    "intro": "Elymus strictus var. crassus, commonly known as thickstem wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and robust, coarse stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with reddish hues, and its leaves are typically blue-green in color with prominent veins. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its hardiness and ecological value, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for wildlife."
