    "intro": "Eragrostis mairei var. eglandis, commonly known as the glandless lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
