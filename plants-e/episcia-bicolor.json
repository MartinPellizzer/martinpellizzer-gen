    "intro": "Episcia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored waxplant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, bicolor flowers that typically feature a combination of red and white or pink hues. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Episcia bicolor is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
