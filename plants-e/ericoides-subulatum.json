    "intro": "Ericoides subulatum, commonly known as the needle-leaved ericoid, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Ericoides subulatum is well adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
