    "intro": "Epidendrum andrei, commonly known as the Andean Epidendrum, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is native to the Andes Mountains. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and can range in color from white to pink or purple, depending on the variety. Epidendrum andrei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its adaptability to various growing conditions."
