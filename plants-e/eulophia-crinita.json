    "intro": "Eulophia crinita, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, hairy inflorescence and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eulophia crinita is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
