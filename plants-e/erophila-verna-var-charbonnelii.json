    "intro": "Erophila verna var. charbonnelii, commonly known as the spring willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different flower color and growth habit compared to the typical Erophila verna."
