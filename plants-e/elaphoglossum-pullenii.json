    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pullenii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear to lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a hymenium. Elaphoglossum pullenii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
