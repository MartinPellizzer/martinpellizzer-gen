    "intro": "Elymus chonoticus, commonly known as the Chinese wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-rowed florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. Elymus chonoticus is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils."
