    "intro": "Euphorbia consobrina, commonly known as the \"Coral Spurge,\" is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems that often exhibit a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, contributing to its drought tolerance. Euphorbia consobrina is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
