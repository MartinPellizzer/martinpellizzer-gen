    "intro": "Erianthus tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
