    "intro": "Ericoides cerviciflorum, commonly known as the neck-flowered ericoid, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils, a common trait among members of the heath family. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions."
