    "intro": "Encyclia trautmannii, commonly known as the Trautmann's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Encyclia trautmannii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
