    "intro": "Escallonia callcottiae var. fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandeziana Escallonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal flowering."
