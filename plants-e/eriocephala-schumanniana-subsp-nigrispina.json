It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean-type climates. Its subspecies name, *nigrispina*, refers to the dark, prominent spines that cover its stems. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
