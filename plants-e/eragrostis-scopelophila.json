    "intro": "Eragrostis scopelophila, commonly known as the cliff grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes and cliffs. Due to its resilience, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
