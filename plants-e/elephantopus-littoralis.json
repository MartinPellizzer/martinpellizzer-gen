    "intro": "Elephantopus littoralis, commonly known as the seaside dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and tidal conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and help stabilize dune ecosystems. Elephantopus littoralis plays a role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
