    "intro": "Elytrigia intermedia subsp. epirotica, commonly known as the Epirotic meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, often in temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Botanically, it is distinguished by its morphological features and genetic differentiation from other subspecies of Elytrigia intermedia."
