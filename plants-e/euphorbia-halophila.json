    "intro": "Euphorbia halophila, commonly known as the saltbush euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is adapted to saline environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, which further minimize water evaporation. Euphorbia halophila is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
