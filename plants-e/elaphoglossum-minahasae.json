    "intro": "Elaphoglossum minahasae, commonly known as the Minahasa holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in specialized clusters called sori. Elaphoglossum minahasae thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories where it relies on consistent moisture and dappled sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
