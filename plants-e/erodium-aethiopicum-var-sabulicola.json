    "intro": "Erodium aethiopicum var. sabulicola, commonly known as sand eryngo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
