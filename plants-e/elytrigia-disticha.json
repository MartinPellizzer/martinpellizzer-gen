    "intro": "Elytrigia disticha, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to spread across various habitats. Elytrigia disticha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
