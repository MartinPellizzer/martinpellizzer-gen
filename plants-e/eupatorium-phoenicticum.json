    "intro": "Eupatorium phoenicticum, commonly known as purple boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers. The plant produces tiny, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive texture."
