    "intro": "Ehrharta multinoda, commonly known as silky grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale-green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Ehrharta multinoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
