    "intro": "Euphorbia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically short and rounded, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Euphorbia sessiliflora is also noted for its ability to tolerate full sun and well-drained soils."
