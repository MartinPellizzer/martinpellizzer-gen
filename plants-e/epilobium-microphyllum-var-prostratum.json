    "intro": "Epilobium microphyllum var. prostratum, commonly known as prostrate willowherb, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features prostrate or decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. Small, pink to reddish flowers are arranged in clusters, and they bloom from late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed sites."
