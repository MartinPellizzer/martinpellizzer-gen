    "intro": "Epilobium macropus, commonly known as the large-flowered willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features upright stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, and it produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are borne on elongated pedicels. Epilobium macropus is known for its ecological value, providing nectar for bees and other pollinators."
