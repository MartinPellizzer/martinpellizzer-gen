It is characterized by its woody stems and alternate leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its latex sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Euphorbion dendroideum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats."
