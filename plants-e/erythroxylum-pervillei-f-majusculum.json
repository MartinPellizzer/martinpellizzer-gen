    "intro": "Erythroxylum pervillei f. majusculum, commonly known as the large-leaved copal tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous seeds, and the plant is often found in humid, lowland forests. It has been used traditionally for its latex and other parts, though it is not as well-known as other species in the Erythroxylum genus."
