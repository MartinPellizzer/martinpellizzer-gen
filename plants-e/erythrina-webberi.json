    "intro": "Erythrina webberi, commonly known as the red flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with three to seven leaflets, and its bark is often smooth with a reddish hue. Erythrina webberi is a fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it a popular ornamental species. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and contain toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
