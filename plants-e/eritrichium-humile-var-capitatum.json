    "intro": "Eritrichium humile var. capitatum, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing annual herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, which is characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
