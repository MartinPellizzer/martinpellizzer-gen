    "intro": "Euphrasia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping woundwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems that hug the ground, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals and a distinctive spurred lower petal, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a bluish-gray hue. Euphrasia humifusa is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties remain largely under-researched."
