    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucoxylon var. rubra, commonly known as the red ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown inner layer, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a whitish underside. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia."
