    "intro": "Euphorbia schaeferi, commonly known as Schaefer's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Euphorbia schaeferi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
