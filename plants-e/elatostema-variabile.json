    "intro": "Elatostema variabile, commonly known as the variable elatostemum, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are often eaten by birds. Elatostema variabile is known for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
