    "intro": "Euphorbia papillosa var. cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's milkplant, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
