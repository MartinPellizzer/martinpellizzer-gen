    "intro": "Eleocharis ovata var. humifusa, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other wet habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
