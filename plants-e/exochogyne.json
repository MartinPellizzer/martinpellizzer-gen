    "intro": "Exochogyne, commonly known as the \"scented cycad,\" is a genus of cycads native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves and a tall, unbranched trunk. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Exochogyne species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are now considered endangered."
