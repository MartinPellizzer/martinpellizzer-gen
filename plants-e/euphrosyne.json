    "intro": "Euphrosyne, commonly known as the golden bell, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Euphrosyne thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
