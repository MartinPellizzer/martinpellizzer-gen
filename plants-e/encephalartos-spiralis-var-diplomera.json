    "intro": "Encephalartos spiralis var. diplomera, commonly known as the Diplomera cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, stout trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish cones that are typically pollinated by insects, a process that is essential for its reproduction. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
