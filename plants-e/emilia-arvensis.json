    "intro": "Emilia arvensis, commonly known as Common Emilia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, branching stems that often grow from the base, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, three-lobed capsule that dehisces to release the seeds. Emilia arvensis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
