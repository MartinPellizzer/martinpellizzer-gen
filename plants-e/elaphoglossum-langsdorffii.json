    "intro": "Elaphoglossum langsdorffii, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often broadly ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is native to regions in South America. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum langsdorffii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
