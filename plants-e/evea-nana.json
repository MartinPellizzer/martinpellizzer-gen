    "intro": "Evea nana, commonly known as the dwarf evea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
