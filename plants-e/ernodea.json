    "intro": "Ernodea, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing several round, brown seeds. Ernodea is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in many regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
