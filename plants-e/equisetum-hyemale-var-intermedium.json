    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, rough spines. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili at the top of its stems, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living seedless vascular plants."
