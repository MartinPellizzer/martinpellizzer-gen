    "intro": "Euphorbia balearica, commonly known as the Balearic spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, greenish-gray stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia balearica is adapted to rocky and coastal habitats, showcasing resilience to drought and salt exposure."
