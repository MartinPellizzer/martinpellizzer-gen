    "intro": "Evolvulus saxifragus, commonly known as the rock pepper or desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in crevices and along canyon walls. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to poor soil conditions. Evolvulus saxifragus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
