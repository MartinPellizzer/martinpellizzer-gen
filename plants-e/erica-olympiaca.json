    "intro": "Erica olympiaca, commonly known as the Olympic heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and moist, shaded areas. Erica olympiaca is well adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat and is an important component of the local flora."
