    "intro": "Equisetum bauhinii, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of horsetail that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are used for reproduction. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves and roots. Equisetum bauhinii is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
