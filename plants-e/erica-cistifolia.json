    "intro": "Erica cistifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica cistifolia is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
