    "intro": "Encelia anomala, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features silver-gray foliage and produces yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions. Encelia anomala plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
