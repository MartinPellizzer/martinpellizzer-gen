    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. goodmanii, commonly known as the Goodmann's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive, early-season blooms."
