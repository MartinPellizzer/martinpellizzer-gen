    "intro": "Elaeocarpus fraseri, commonly known as Fraser\u2019s elaeocarp, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, blue-black berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests or secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
