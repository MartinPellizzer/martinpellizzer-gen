    "intro": "Erysimum tilimii, commonly known as the Tibetan wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cold and arid environments. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erysimum tilimii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
