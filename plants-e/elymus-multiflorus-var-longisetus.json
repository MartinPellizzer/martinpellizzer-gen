    "intro": "Elymus multiflorus var. longisetus, commonly known as the long-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for wildlife."
