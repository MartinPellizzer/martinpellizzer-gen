    "intro": "Elephantopus sordidus, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and southern Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has heart-shaped, rough leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
