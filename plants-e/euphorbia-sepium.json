    "intro": "Euphorbia sepium, commonly known as the greater spurge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in branched clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia sepium contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so it should be handled with care. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides."
