    "intro": "Echinocereus stolonifer, commonly known as the stoloniferous hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with cylindrical stems that often branch out to form a shrub-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are typically white to yellow, providing protection from herbivores. Echinocereus stolonifer is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
