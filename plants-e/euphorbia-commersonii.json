    "intro": "Euphorbia commersonii, commonly known as Commerson's spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Euphorbia commersonii is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
