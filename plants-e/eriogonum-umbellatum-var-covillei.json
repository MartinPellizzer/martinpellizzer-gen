    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. covillei, commonly known as Coville's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Coville's buckwheat is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
