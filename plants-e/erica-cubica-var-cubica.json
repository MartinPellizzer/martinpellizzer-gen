    "intro": "Erica cubica var. cubica, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 cm and features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or red during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica cubica var. cubica is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
