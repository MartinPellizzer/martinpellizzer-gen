    "intro": "Elymus subvillosus, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and slender, arching stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
