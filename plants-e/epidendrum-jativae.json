    "intro": "Epidendrum jativae, commonly known as the Jatival orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the summer months. It has long, slender pseudobulbs and linear leaves that are adapted to its humid, tropical environment. Epidendrum jativae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
