    "intro": "Echites mollis, commonly known as the silky ant plant, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique structure allows it to form symbiotic relationships with ants, which provide protection in exchange for shelter and food. Echites mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
