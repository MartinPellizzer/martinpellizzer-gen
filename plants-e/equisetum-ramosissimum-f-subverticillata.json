It features a tall, unbranched stem with whorls of small, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is notable for its spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
