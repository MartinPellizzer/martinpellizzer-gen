    "intro": "Eremopanax angustatus f. intermedius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf eremopanax, is a rare variant of the eremopanax genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
