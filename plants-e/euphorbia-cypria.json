    "intro": "Euphorbia cypria, commonly known as the Cyprus spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Cyprus. It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its arid native environment. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience. However, it contains toxic sap, so caution is necessary when handling it."
