    "intro": "Eriocaulon fusiforme, commonly known as the spindle rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and are pollinated by wind or water."
