    "intro": "Elymus flexilis, commonly known as the flexible wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Elymus flexilis is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a useful plant for erosion control."
