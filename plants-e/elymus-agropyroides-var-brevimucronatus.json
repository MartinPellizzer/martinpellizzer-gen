    "intro": "Elymus agropyroides var. brevimucronatus, commonly known as the short-bladed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
