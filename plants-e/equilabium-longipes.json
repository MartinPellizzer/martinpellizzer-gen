It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
