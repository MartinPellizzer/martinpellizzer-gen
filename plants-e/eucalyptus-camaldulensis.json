    "intro": "Eucalyptus camaldulensis, commonly known as the river red gum, is a tall, deciduous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and long, narrow leaves that turn red in autumn. The tree produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of soil types, including saline and waterlogged conditions. The river red gum plays an important ecological role in riparian zones and is a keystone species in many Australian ecosystems."
