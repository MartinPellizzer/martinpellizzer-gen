    "intro": "Euphorbia wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by colorful bracts. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and can survive in poor soil conditions. Euphorbia wallichii is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
