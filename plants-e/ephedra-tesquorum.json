    "intro": "Ephedra tesquorum, commonly known as the Desert Tea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow-green flowers and later, small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used by indigenous peoples for various traditional purposes."
