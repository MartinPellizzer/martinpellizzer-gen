    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudagraria, commonly known as the false agrimony, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Euphorbia pseudagraria is also noted for its succulent-like leaves, which help it conserve water in arid conditions."
