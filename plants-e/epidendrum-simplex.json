    "intro": "Epidendrum simplex, commonly known as the common epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant has long, slender stems and produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Epidendrum simplex is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
