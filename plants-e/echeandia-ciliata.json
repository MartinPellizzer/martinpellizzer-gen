    "intro": "Echeandia ciliata, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late winter or early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
