    "intro": "Eucomis pallidiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pineapple lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It features tall, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, with a central spike bearing white to pale yellow flowers. The inflorescence resembles a pineapple, hence its common name, and blooms from summer to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for garden borders or containers. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
