    "intro": "Evax emporitana, commonly known as the Mediterranean marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant features tall, slender stems with whorled leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow or greenish flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
