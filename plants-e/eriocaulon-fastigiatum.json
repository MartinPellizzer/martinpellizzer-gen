    "intro": "Eriocaulon fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
