    "intro": "Erysimum maculatum, commonly known as the candytuft, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are oval to heart-shaped with a hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Erysimum maculatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
