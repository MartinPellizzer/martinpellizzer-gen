    "intro": "Eulophia undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in mountainous regions. The plant features a pseudobulb with long, narrow leaves that have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Eulophia undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
