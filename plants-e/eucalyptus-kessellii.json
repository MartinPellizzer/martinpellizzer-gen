    "intro": "Eucalyptus kessellii, commonly known as the Kessell's gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from grey to white in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats."
