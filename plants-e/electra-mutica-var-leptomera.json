    "intro": "Electra mutica var. leptomera, commonly known as the slender leathery lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dark green to blackish upper surface with a smooth, leathery texture, while the lower surface is white and covered with tiny, rounded pores. The thallus is loosely branched and can form dense mats on tree trunks and rocks. It is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants. This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms."
