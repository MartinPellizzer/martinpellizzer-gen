    "intro": "Euphorbia glyptosperma var. tenerrima, commonly known as the Cape York euphorbia, is a shrub native to Australia. It features a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. The plant is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, which is a common trait among many euphorbias."
