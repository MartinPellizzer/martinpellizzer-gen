The plant has opposite, simple, and usually oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Eugenia duplicata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
