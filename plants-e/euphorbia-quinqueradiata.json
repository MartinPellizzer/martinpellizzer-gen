    "intro": "Euphorbia quinqueradiata, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, spine-tipped stems and produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically small and alternate, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. Euphorbia quinqueradiata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
