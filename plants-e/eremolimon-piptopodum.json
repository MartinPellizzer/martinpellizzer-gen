    "intro": "Eremolimon piptopodum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Eremolimon piptopodum is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native environment."
