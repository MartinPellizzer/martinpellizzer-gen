    "intro": "Epipactis viridans, commonly known as the green helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a tall, erect stem bearing several pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. It has a complex flowering structure with a spurred lip that serves as a nectar source for pollinators. Epipactis viridans is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native range."
