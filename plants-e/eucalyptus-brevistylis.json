    "intro": "Eucalyptus brevistylis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, globular flower clusters that typically appear in winter. The plant is part of the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known eucalyptus species. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands. Eucalyptus brevistylis is adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from its lignified stems after a bushfire."
