    "intro": "Eucodonia, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plants typically grow as shrubs, featuring evergreen leaves that are leathery and glossy. Eucodonia species are characterized by their small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. These plants are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought and heat."
