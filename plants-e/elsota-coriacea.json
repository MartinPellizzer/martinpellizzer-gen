    "intro": "Elsota coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf elms, is a species of deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is typically grayish-brown and becomes deeply furrowed with age. Elsota coriacea is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
