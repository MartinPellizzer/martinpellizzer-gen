    "intro": "Eriocaulon gomphrenoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a narrow, cylindrical shape. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often reddish or purplish in color, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Eriocaulon gomphrenoides is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
