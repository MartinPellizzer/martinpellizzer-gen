    "intro": "Eleocharis rostellata var. congdonii, commonly known as the Congo sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations to its aquatic surroundings."
