    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus hastatus, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and unique, star-shaped spines that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
