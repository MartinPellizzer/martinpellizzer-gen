    "intro": "Echeveria helleri, commonly known as 'Lola', is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are slightly textured and covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its color and shape. Echeveria helleri is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
