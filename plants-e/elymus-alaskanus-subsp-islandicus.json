    "intro": "Elymus alaskanus subsp. islandicus, commonly known as the Alaska island wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly clustered, with small, awned lemmas that are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, coastal environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
