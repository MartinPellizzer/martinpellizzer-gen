    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 mossii, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Elymus glaucus and Elymus trachycoleus. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas and is native to the western United States. The plant has slender, tufted culms with dense, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are often green to bluish-green in color. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, and it is well adapted to dry, sandy soils. Elymus \u00d7 mossii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
