    "intro": "Epipactis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dark green, hooded flowers with a distinctive yellow and green pattern on the lip. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Epipactis pubescens is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
