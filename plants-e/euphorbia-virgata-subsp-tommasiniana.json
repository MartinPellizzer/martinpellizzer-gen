It features a short, woody stem with prominent, fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
