    "intro": "Eriocaulon kasaragodense, commonly known as the Kasaragod hairgrass, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern India. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae, which includes grass-like plants characterized by their small, clustered inflorescences. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in marshy environments and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
