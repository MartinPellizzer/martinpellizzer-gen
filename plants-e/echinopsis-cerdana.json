    "intro": "Echinopsis cerdana, commonly known as the Cerda's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a short, thick stem and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. The plant has spiny areoles and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Its flowers are often nocturnal, opening at night to attract specific pollinators. Echinopsis cerdana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cultivation."
