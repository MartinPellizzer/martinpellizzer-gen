    "intro": "Eriogonum dendroideum var. typicum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
