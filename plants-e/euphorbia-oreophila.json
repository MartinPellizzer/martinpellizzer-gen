    "intro": "Euphorbia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils and arid conditions. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Euphorbia oreophila is a hardy species that thrives in well-drained environments and is often found in mountainous or rocky habitats."
