    "intro": "Ephemerum, commonly known as the short-lived plant, is a unique species characterized by its ephemeral blooming cycle. It typically thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts to extreme conditions with specialized water-storing tissues. The plant's leaves are often succulent, allowing it to retain moisture during dry periods. Its flowers, which appear briefly during the rainy season, are usually small and brightly colored to attract pollinators. Due to its limited lifespan, Ephemerum plays a vital role in its ecosystem as a temporary but essential food source for various insects and small animals."
