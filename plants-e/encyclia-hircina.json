    "intro": "Encyclia hircina, commonly known as the goat orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are strap-like and grass-like, growing from the base of the pseudobulb. Encyclia hircina is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
