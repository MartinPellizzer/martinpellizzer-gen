    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf spurge or miniature spurge, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower-like structures, typically appearing in late spring. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
