    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale subsp. ramosum, commonly known as the scaly horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, segmented stems and spore-producing cones. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features whorled leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures, with the main stem bearing fertile branches that produce spore-bearing structures. It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era. The scaly horsetail is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity."
