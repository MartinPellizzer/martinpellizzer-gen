It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and is often found in coastal regions. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the stems are hairy and often twine around supports. The fruit is a distinctive, spirally coiled pod that opens to release seeds when mature."
