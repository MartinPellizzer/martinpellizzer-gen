    "intro": "Eleocharis gracilis var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond margins. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
