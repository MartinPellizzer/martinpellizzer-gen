    "intro": "Elaphrium aspleniifolium, commonly known as the silver fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name, with a distinctive frond structure that resembles a fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphrium aspleniifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
