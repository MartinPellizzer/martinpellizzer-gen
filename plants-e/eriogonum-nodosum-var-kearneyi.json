It is characterized by its clustered, sparsely leafed stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
