    "intro": "Erica ciliaris, commonly known as the silver heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western and southern regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with silvery-white undersides that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring. Erica ciliaris thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. It is a hardy plant that is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat."
