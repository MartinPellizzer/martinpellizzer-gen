    "intro": "Epidendrum ernstii, commonly known as the Ernest's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. The orchid's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its natural habitat."
