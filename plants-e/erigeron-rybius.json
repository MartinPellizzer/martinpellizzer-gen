    "intro": "Erigeron rybius, commonly known as Rybius fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The leaves are generally hairy and alternate, with a rough texture that aids in water retention."
