    "intro": "Elaphoglossum dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive two-form structure, where the fertile and sterile fronds differ in appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum dimorphum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
