    "intro": "Eriogonum brevicaule var. loganum, commonly known as the Logan\u2019s buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or marginal soils."
