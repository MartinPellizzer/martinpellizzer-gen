    "intro": "Epidendrum moniliforme, commonly known as the bead\u8559 or necklace orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media. Epidendrum moniliforme is popular among orchid growers for its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
