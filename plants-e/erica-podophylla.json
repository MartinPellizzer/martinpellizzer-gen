    "intro": "Erica podophylla, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, evergreen leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica podophylla is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy coastal species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
