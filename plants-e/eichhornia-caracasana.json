    "intro": "Eichhornia caracasana, commonly known as water hyacinth, is an aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and arrow-shaped, with a waxy surface. The plant produces dense clusters of showy purple-blue flowers that bloom throughout the year. Water hyacinth grows rapidly, often forming dense mats on the water surface, which can impact water flow and quality. It is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
