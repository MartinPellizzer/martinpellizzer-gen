    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides subsp. portulacoides, commonly known as the cushion spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and rocky environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
