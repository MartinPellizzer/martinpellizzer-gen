    "intro": "Epidendrum connatum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a lady's slipper, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
