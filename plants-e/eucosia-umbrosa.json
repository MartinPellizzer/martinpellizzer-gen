    "intro": "Eucosia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy eucosia, is a flowering plant native to the shaded understories of tropical forests. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Eucosia umbrosa thrives in humid, low-light environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology allows it to efficiently capture limited sunlight in its natural habitat."
