    "intro": "Elisma natans var. sparganiifolium, commonly known as the floating leaf water plantain, is a flowering plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with the stems and roots submerged. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically long and flat, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes."
