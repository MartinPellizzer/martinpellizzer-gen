    "intro": "Eleocharis japonica, commonly known as Japanese spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a spike, composed of numerous small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, pond margins, and irrigated fields. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis japonica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
