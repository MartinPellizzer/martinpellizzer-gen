    "intro": "Evaiezoa biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in pairs, hence its scientific name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Evaiezoa biflora is considered a vulnerable species."
