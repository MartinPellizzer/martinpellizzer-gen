    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia f. varians, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and a tall, erect stem bearing numerous showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is often more elongated and broader than in other varieties of the species. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in humid environments and its role in supporting local insect populations."
