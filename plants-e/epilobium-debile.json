    "intro": "Epilobium debile, commonly known as slender willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its small, pink to purple flowers appear in spikes during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. Epilobium debile is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
