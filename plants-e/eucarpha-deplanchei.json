    "intro": "Eucarpha deplanchei, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Eucarpha deplanchei plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes."
