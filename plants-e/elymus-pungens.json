    "intro": "Elymus pungens, commonly known as the prairie grass or speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, and its leaves are narrow with a rough, hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or brown. Elymus pungens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
