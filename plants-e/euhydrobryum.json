    "intro": "Euhydrobryum, commonly known as the water moss, is a genus of small, aquatic or semi-aquatic liverworts. These plants typically grow in moist environments such as stream banks, wetlands, and shaded forest floors. They have a thalloid structure, which is a flat, ribbon-like body that lacks true stems and leaves. Euhydrobryum species are characterized by their ability to absorb water through their entire surface, aiding in their survival in humid conditions. Their simple morphology and reliance on moisture make them important indicators of environmental health in wetland ecosystems."
