    "intro": "Enchysia erecta, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a robust root system that includes pneumatophores, specialized root structures that allow it to absorb oxygen from the air. Enchysia erecta thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
