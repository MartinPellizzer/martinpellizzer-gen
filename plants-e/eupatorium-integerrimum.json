It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.
