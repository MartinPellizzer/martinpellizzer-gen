    "intro": "Euphoria setosa, commonly known as the sticky euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy, sticky coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which further aid in water conservation. Euphoria setosa is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal rainfall."
