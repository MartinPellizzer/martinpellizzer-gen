    "intro": "Euonymus europaeus var. australis, commonly known as the European spurge or winter acorn. This variant is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. The plant is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, and it has a moderate growth rate. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and persistent fruits."
