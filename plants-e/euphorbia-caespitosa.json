    "intro": "Euphorbia caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a compact, low-growing rosette of fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Euphorbia caespitosa is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
