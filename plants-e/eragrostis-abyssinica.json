    "intro": "Eragrostis abyssinica, commonly known as Abyssinian lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Ethiopia and parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. Eragrostis abyssinica is often used for forage and soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
