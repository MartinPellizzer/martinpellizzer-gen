    "intro": "Epilobium fugitivum, commonly known as the wandering willow, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems that often trail along the ground. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Epilobium fugitivum is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry meadows, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
