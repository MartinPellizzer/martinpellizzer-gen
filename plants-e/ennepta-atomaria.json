    "intro": "Ennepta atomaria, commonly known as the small white tortrix, is a species of moth whose larvae feed on various plants, including grasses and sedges. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for this insect, contributing to the ecological interactions within its habitat. While not a plant itself, the name Ennepta atomaria refers to the moth, and there may be confusion with actual plant species. If you were referring to a plant with this name, it might be a rare or less commonly documented species. Please clarify if you meant a specific plant."
