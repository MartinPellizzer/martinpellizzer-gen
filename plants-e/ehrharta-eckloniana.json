    "intro": "Ehrharta eckloniana, commonly known as coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind exposure. Ehrharta eckloniana is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
