    "intro": "Elaphoglossum meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's holly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides, where it thrives in the understory. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Elaphoglossum meyeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
