    "intro": "Eranthemum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved eranthemum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions. Eranthemum microphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
