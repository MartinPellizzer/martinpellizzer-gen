    "intro": "Erica nevillei, commonly known as Neville's heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape province, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form with dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. It typically blooms in spring, producing pink to red hues that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
