    "intro": "Emmenanthe rosea, commonly known as the pink fairy fan, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble lace, making it highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited natural habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Emmenanthe rosea is considered a conservation concern."
