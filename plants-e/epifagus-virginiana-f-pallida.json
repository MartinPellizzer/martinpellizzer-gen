    "intro": "Epifagus virginiana f. pallida, commonly known as the white-veined striped maple, is a variant of the striped maple native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive white veins on its pale green leaves, which contrast sharply with the typical green foliage of the species. The plant is typically found in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This form is less common than the typical striped maple and is often noted for its ornamental value in horticulture."
