    "intro": "Ericoides canaliculatum, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Ericoides canaliculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
