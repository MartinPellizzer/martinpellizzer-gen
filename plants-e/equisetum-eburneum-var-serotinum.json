    "intro": "Equisetum eburneum var. serotinum, commonly known as the late-fruiting scouring rush, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, typically emerging later in the growing season compared to the main species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
