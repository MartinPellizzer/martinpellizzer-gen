    "intro": "Eucalyptus tholiformis, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that ranges from white to grey in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a greyish-green upper surface. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green or yellowish-white. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments."
