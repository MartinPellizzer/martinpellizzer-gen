    "intro": "Elaphoglossum vittarioides, commonly known as the veined holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of brownish hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum vittarioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
