    "intro": "Euphorbia handiensis, commonly known as the Handien's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant produces a milky, latex-like sap that can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
