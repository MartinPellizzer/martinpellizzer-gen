    "intro": "Eurylepis glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are borne on cyathia, a distinctive feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
