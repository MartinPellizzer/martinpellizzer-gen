    "intro": "Eustachys retusa, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to reddish flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Eustachys retusa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
