    "intro": "Ehretia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf ehretia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from ovate to elliptic, and often exhibits different leaf sizes on the same plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical studies."
