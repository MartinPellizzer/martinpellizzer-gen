    "intro": "Euphorbia cumulicola, commonly known as the mountain euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
