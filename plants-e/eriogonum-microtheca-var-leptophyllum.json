    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca var. leptophyllum, commonly known as the slenderleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry, coastal regions."
