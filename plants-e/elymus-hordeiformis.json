    "intro": "Elymus hordeiformis, commonly known as the barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing multiple small, two-rowed grains. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Elymus hordeiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
