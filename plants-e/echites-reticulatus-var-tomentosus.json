    "intro": "Echites reticulatus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy echites, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
