    "intro": "Echinopsis rhodotricha var. roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to South America. It features a cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces striking pink to red flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
