    "intro": "Eucalyptus hylandii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are usually pink or pale blue, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Its bark is usually fibrous and peels away in strips, revealing a smooth, pale inner layer. Eucalyptus hylandii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climatic conditions."
