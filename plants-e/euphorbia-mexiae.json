    "intro": "Euphorbia mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces a unique cyathium, a cup-like structure that contains the flowers and is often mistaken for a single flower. Euphorbia mexiae is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
