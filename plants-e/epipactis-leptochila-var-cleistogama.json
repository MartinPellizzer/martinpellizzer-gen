    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers, a unique reproductive strategy. The cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinated and do not open, while the open flowers are pollinated by insects. This orchid thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip, and it is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi."
