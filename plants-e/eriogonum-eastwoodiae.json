    "intro": "Eriogonum eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and chaparral areas. It has hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
