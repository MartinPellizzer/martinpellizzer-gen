    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 trachyodon var. concolor, commonly known as the green scouring rush, is a hybrid fern-like plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, spore-bearing cones. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is notable for its lack of true leaves, instead having nodes and internodes with whorls of branches. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are hollow and jointed, and they can persist through winter, making it a hardy perennial. The spores are produced in the terminal cones, which are often green and cylindrical in appearance."
