    "intro": "Eryngium coronatum, commonly known as the crown thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by white bracts, which resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has a rough, hairy stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Eryngium coronatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
