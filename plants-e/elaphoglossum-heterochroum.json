    "intro": "Elaphoglossum heterochroum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky habitats. Its unique leaf morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
