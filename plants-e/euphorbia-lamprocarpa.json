    "intro": "Euphorbia lamprocarpa, commonly known as the silver-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, pale green stems that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its fleshy stems. Euphorbia lamprocarpa is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
