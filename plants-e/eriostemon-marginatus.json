    "intro": "Eriostemon marginatus, commonly known as the coastal wallaby bush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its woody stems are typically covered in a thick, fibrous bark that provides structural support. Eriostemon marginatus is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
