    "intro": "Ehrharta setacea, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
