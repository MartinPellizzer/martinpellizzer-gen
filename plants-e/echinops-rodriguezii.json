It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the distinctive spiky fruits. Echinops rodriguezii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
