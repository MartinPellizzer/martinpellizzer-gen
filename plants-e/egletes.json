    "intro": "Egletes, commonly known as the \"tongue of the sea,\" is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the genus Cakile, which includes several species of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, sandy soils. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom from spring to early summer. Egletes is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh maritime conditions."
