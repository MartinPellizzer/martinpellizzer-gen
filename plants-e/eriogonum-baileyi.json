    "intro": "Eriogonum baileyi, commonly known as Bailey's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum baileyi plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
