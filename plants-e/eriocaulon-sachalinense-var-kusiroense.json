    "intro": "Eriocaulon sachalinense var. kusiroense, commonly known as the Kusiro marsh plant, is a small herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of northern Japan. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often found near the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, typically in wetlands or along the edges of tidal flats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
