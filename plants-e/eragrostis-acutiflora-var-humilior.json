    "intro": "Eragrostis acutiflora var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, pale green to brown flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soil and high temperatures. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
