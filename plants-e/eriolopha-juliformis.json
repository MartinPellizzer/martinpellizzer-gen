    "intro": "Eriolopha juliformis, commonly known as the juliform leafroller, is a species of moth found in southern Africa. It belongs to the family Tortricidae and is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like appearance. The larvae of this species are known to roll leaves into shelters, a behavior that helps them avoid predators. The plant is not a flowering plant but is associated with various host plants, including shrubs and trees. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host plants in its native habitat."
