    "intro": "Euphorbia neocaledonica, commonly known as the Kermadec spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces unique, cyathium-shaped inflorescences that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. Euphorbia neocaledonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm, dry climates."
