    "intro": "Eucalyptus corymbosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrubs or small trees with smooth, peeling bark. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a greyish-green hue, and they are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal regions."
