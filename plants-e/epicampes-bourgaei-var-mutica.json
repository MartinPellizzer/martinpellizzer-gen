It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind."
