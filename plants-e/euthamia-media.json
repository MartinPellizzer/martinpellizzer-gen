    "intro": "Euthamia media, commonly known as slender goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, often with a slightly rough texture. Euthamia media thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks."
