    "intro": "Erythrina argentea, commonly known as silver flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its bark is smooth and often reddish in color. It produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Erythrina argentea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
