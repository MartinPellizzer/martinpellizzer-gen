    "intro": "Erica simulans var. tetragona, commonly known as the four-leaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and its clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal. The variety 'tetragona' is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Erica simulans."
