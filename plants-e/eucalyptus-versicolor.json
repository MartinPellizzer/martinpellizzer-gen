The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with smooth, peeling bark that is often grey or white. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, woody capsules as fruit. This plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
