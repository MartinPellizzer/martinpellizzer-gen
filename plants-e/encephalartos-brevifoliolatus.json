It is characterized by its compact, stout trunk and a crown of short, thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones green, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
