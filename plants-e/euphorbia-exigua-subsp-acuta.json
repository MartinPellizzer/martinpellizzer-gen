    "intro": "Euphorbia exigua subsp. acuta, commonly known as the sharpleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. The plant contains latex, which can be irritating to the skin, so caution is advised when handling it."
