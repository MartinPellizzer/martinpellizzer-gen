    "intro": "Echites heynei, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable feature and has been used in traditional medicine. Echites heynei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
