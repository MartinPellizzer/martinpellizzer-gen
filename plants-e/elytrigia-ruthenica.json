    "intro": "Elytrigia ruthenica, commonly known as the Ruthenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Elytrigia ruthenica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for invertebrates."
