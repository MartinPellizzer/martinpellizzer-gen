    "intro": "Epidendrum papillivesiculatum, commonly known as the papillate vesicle orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its leaves are usually dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant thrives in humid, well-lit environments. Epidendrum papillivesiculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
