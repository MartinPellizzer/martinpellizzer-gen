    "intro": "Epidendrum hunterianum, commonly known as the showy flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, fiery red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Epidendrum hunterianum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
