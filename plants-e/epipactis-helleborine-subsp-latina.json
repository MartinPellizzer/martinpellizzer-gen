    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. latina, commonly known as the Italian helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, sword-shaped leaves and a distinctive inflorescence of greenish-yellow flowers with a showy lip. This subspecies is native to southern Europe and is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish rhizome that serves as a storage organ. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies and beetles, due to their strong, sweet scent."
