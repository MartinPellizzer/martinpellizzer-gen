    "intro": "Euphorbia verdickii, commonly known as the Sudanese spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that help store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia verdickii is often used in traditional medicine, though its use requires caution due to its potentially harmful properties."
