    "intro": "Erigeron nitidus, commonly known as the smooth fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. It features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small white to pale yellow flowers. Erigeron nitidus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to support pollinators."
