    "intro": "Eupatorium palustre, commonly known as marsh boneset, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows up to 2 feet tall, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Eupatorium palustre is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
