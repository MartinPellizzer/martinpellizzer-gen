    "intro": "Elaphoglossum blumeanum var. philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine holly fern, is a fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
