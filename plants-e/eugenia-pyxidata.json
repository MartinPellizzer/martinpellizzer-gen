It features glossy, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature. Eugenia pyxidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
