    "intro": "Eremopyrum cristatum var. brachyatherum, commonly known as the short-bract eremopyrum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its resilience in drought conditions."
