    "intro": "Euonymus rufulus, commonly known as the red-veined elder or red-veined euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically reddish-brown on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Euonymus rufulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
