    "intro": "Eleocharis ovata, commonly known as the oval spike-rush, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dry, three-lobed berries. Eleocharis ovata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
