    "intro": "Ecpoma cauliflora, commonly known as the cauliflower orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where flowers develop directly on the stem rather than at the end of branches. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling cauliflower. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Ecpoma cauliflora is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance."
