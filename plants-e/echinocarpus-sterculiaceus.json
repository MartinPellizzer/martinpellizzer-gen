    "intro": "Echinocarpus sterculiaceus, commonly known as the African burr, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that encase the seeds, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. Its leaves are typically ovate or lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Echinocarpus sterculiaceus is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and waste areas, due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
