    "intro": "Eriocaulon parvistoloniferum, commonly known as the dwarf stoloniferous flat sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its reproductive structures, known as spikelets, are clustered along the flowering stems, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eriocaulon parvistoloniferum is often found in disturbed soils and can serve as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
