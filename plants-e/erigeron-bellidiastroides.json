It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The small blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, contributing to its role in pollinator support in its native habitat."
