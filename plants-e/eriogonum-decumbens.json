    "intro": "Eriogonum decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically has sprawling stems that lie close to the ground, covered in small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and slopes. Eriogonum decumbens is also an important plant for pollinators, particularly bees, due to its abundant nectar-rich flowers."
