    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris var. mucronulata, commonly known as the spike rush, is a sedgy, grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks. The plant has cylindrical stems that bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
