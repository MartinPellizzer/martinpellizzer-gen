    "intro": "Epidendrum linearilingue, commonly known as the slender leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
