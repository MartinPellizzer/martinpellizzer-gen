    "intro": "Eriocaulon robustium var. nigrum, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often submerged or floating at the water's surface. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
