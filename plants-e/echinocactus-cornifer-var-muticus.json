    "intro": "Echinocactus cornifer var. muticus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem and spiny, red to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. The variety 'muticus' is distinguished by its reduced spines and a more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Echinocactus cornifer."
