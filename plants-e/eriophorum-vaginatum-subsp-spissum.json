    "intro": "Eriophorum vaginatum subsp. spissum, commonly known as tussock cottongrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and the production of fluffy, white seed heads that are typical of the Cyperaceae family. The plant forms tussocks, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. Its leaves are usually short and stiff, and the flowering stems are often shorter than the leaves. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of tundra and wetland ecosystems."
