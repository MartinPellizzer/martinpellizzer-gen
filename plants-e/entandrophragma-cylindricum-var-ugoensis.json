    "intro": "Entandrophragma cylindricum var. ugoensis, commonly known as the African teak, is a tropical hardwood species native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its straight grain and fine, even texture, making it highly valued for its durability and workability. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a cylindrical trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark. It thrives in moist tropical forests and is often found in association with other hardwood species. Due to its economic importance, it is also subject to conservation concerns due to overharvesting."
