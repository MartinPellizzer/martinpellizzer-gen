    "intro": "Elytrigia \u00d7 laxa, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that combines traits from its parent species, Elytrigia repens and Elytrigia calycina. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is commonly found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid origin, Elytrigia \u00d7 laxa exhibits genetic variability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
