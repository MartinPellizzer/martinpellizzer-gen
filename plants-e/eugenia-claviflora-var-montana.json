    "intro": "Eugenia claviflora var. montana, commonly known as the mountain clove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the highland regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
