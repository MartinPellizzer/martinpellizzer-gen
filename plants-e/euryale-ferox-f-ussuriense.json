    "intro": "Euryale ferox f. ussuriense, commonly known as the Ussuri water caltrop, is a variant of the water caltrop native to eastern Asia. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive, spiky, spherical fruit that floats on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and ponds. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, typically submerged, while the stems are long and flexible. The fruit contains a single, hard-shelled seed, which is the primary edible part of the plant."
