    "intro": "Euphorbia graminifolia, commonly known as the grass euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that resemble grass, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia graminifolia is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
