    "intro": "Erysimum gelidum var. kotschyi, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with low temperatures and strong sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh climates. It is often found in alpine meadows and is a member of the Brassicaceae family."
