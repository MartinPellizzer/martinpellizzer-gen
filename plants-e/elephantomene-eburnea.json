    "intro": "Elephantomene eburnea, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a large deciduous tree native to the savannas of West Africa. It is characterized by its thick, buttressed trunk and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, with a leathery texture. The tree is valued for its shea nuts, which are used to produce shea butter, an important commodity in local economies."
