    "intro": "Echinochlaenia, commonly known as the spiny grass or false brome, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plants typically have slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, clustered inflorescences. Echinochlaenia species are characterized by their tough, fibrous structure, which makes them resilient to grazing and environmental stress. They play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in their native habitats."
