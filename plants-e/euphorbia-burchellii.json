    "intro": "Euphorbia burchellii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which can be irritating to the skin. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Euphorbia burchellii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
