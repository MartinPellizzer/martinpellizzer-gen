    "intro": "Euphorbia clementei subsp. faurei, commonly known as the Faure's Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
