    "intro": "Echinodorus ranunculoides f. natans, commonly known as the floating heart, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, floating leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy surface. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while its leaves float on the water's surface. This species is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide oxygen and shelter for aquatic life."
