    "intro": "Eitenia praxeloides, commonly known as the Praxeloides tree, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, gray bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
