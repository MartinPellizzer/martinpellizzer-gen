    "intro": "Eragrostis mariae, commonly known as the Marie's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale to golden-green florets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Eragrostis mariae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
