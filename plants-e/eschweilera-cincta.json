    "intro": "Eschweilera cincta, commonly known as the scarlet wax palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Eschweilera cincta produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red fruits, which contain edible seeds. Due to its ornamental value and habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
