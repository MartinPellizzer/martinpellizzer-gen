    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. scaberium, commonly known as the rough scaberous horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of stiff, scaly, and often rough-textured leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Due to its ancient lineage, it is considered a living fossil, with a morphology similar to that of prehistoric plants."
