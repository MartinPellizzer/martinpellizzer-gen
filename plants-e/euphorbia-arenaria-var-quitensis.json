    "intro": "Euphorbia arenaria var. quitensis, commonly known as the Andean sand spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats at high altitudes. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
