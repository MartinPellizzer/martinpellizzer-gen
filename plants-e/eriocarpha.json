    "intro": "Eriocarpha, commonly known as the \"Brazilian burr\" or \"cotton bur,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their woody stems and hairy, spiny fruits that enclose the seeds. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with serrated edges, and the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Eriocarpha species are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are often found in dry, open habitats. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
