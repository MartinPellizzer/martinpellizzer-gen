    "intro": "Epipactis persica subsp. danubialis, commonly known as the Danube Persian orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Danube region. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, hairy stem and linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows or along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
