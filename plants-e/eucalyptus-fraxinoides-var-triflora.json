    "intro": "Eucalyptus fraxinoides var. triflora, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a variant of the eucalyptus genus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is fibrous and peels in thin layers, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
