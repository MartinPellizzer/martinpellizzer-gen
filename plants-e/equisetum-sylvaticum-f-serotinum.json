    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum f. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, ridged stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are typical of horsetails. This fernophyte is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its stems often remain green throughout the year. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
