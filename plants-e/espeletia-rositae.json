    "intro": "Espeletia rositae, commonly known as the Rosita's heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Espeletia rositae is considered a rare and endemic species."
