    "intro": "Eucalyptus prava, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, and they are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. The bark is usually smooth and peels in strips, while the wood is lightweight and used in local crafts. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
