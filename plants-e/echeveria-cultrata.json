It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a slight sheen. The leaves are narrow and pointed, resembling a sword, which gives the plant its common name. It produces striking pinkish-red flowers on tall stalks during the spring and summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
