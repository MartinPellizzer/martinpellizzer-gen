    "intro": "Elymus velutinus, commonly known as velvet foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, soft, hairy lemma that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as wet meadows and marshes. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. Elymus velutinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland soils."
