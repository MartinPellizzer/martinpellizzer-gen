    "intro": "Euonymus sieboldianus f. albicarpus, commonly known as the white-fruited euonymus, is a unique cultivar of the euonymus plant characterized by its striking white or pale yellow fruits. This ornamental shrub is native to East Asia and is valued for its compact growth habit and vibrant foliage. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a range of green shades throughout the growing season. The most distinctive feature of this plant is its showy, fleshy fruits that contrast sharply with the foliage, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
