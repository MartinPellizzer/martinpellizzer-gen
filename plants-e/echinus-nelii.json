    "intro": "Echinus nelii, commonly known as the Mediterranean sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Echinus nelii thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
