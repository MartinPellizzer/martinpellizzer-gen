    "intro": "Elymus transbaicalensis, commonly known as the Transbaikal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Elymus transbaicalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
