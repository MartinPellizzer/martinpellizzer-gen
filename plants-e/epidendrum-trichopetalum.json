    "intro": "Epidendrum trichopetalum, commonly known as the hairy-petalled epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum trichopetalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
