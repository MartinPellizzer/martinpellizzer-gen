    "intro": "Euphorbia deserticola, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its thick, waxy cuticle reduces water loss, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from deep underground. Euphorbia deserticola is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to desert ecosystems."
