    "intro": "Erythroxylum brevipes f. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved coca, is a variant of the coca plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, narrow fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with a woody stem and alternate leaves. This subspecies is closely related to other coca species and is often cultivated for its psychoactive properties."
