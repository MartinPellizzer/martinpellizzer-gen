It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads and hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Eryngium gymnocephalum is valued for its ornamental appearance and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
