    "intro": "Eurycaulis undulatus, commonly known as the wavy leaf fern, is a unique plant characterized by its undulating, wavy-edged leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The fronds are usually bi-lobed and have a delicate, feathery appearance, making it a striking addition to botanical collections."
