    "intro": "Eriocaulon lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly thread-plant, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshy or swampy habitats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Eriocaulon lanuginosum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
