It is a climbing or trailing plant native to Mexico and the southern United States. The plant features flat, fleshy stems that are often segmented and covered in fine spines. Its most striking feature is its large, showy flowers that open at night and emit a strong fragrance. Epiphyllum crenatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
