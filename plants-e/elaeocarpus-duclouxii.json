    "intro": "Elaeocarpus duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of New Guinea and the Moluccas. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
