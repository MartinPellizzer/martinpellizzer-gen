It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and are usually pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Epilobium dodonaei is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
