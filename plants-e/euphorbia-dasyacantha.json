    "intro": "Euphorbia dasyacantha, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, with the main photosynthetic function carried out by the stem. Euphorbia dasyacantha is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival during dry periods."
