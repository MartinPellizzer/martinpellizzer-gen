    "intro": "Eriocapitella vitifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly grapeleaf, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, followed by small, berry-like fruits. This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
