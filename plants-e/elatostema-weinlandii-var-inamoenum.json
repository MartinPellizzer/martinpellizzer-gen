    "intro": "Elatostema weinlandii var. inamoenum, commonly known as the velvetleaf stellaria, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for specialty gardens."
