    "intro": "Espeletia tibamoensis, commonly known as the Tibamoan heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cold, dry climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Espeletia tibamoensis is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
