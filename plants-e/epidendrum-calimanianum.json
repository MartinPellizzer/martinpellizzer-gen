    "intro": "Epidendrum calimanianum, commonly known as the Calimanian Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in drier conditions for short periods. Epidendrum calimanianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
