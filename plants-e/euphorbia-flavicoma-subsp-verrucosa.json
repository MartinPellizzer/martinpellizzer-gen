    "intro": "Euphorbia flavicoma subsp. verrucosa, commonly known as the yellow-flowered euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it often has a spiny appearance. This subspecies is valued for its unique morphology and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
