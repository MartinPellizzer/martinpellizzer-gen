    "intro": "Euthodon, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Euthodon thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, three-lobed capsule that aids in wind dispersal."
