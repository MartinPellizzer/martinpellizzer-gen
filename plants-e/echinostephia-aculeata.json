    "intro": "Echinostephia aculeata, commonly known as the spiny stephania, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Echinostephia aculeata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its name refers to the spiny structures that adorn its stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
