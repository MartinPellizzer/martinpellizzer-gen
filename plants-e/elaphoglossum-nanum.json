    "intro": "Elaphoglossum nanum, commonly known as the small holly fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a membranous shield. Elaphoglossum nanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
