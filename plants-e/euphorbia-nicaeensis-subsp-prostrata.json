    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
