    "intro": "Euonymus fimbriatus var. serratus, commonly known as the serrated woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
