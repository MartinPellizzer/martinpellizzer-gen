    "intro": "Eberlanzia horrescens var. densa, commonly known as the dense eberlanzia, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
