    "intro": "Eleocharis tenarum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in its habitat. Eleocharis tenarum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
