    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis var. elongata, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, narrow spikes of small, greenish flowers that emerge from dense clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense vegetation in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears numerous tiny, spikelet-like flower clusters. This variety is distinguished by its elongated stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
