It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in a vibrant array of colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on the nutrients from decaying organic matter. Its unique floral structure and striking appearance make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
