    "intro": "Euphorbia megalatlantica, commonly known as the giant African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often modified into spines, a feature common in desert plants. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It stores water in its stems, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia megalatlantica is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
