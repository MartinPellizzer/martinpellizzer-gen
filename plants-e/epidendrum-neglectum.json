    "intro": "Epidendrum neglectum, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, white to light pink flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water. Epidendrum neglectum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
