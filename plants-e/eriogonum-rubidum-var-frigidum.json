    "intro": "Eriogonum rubidum var. frigidum, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh winter conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing food for pollinators and other wildlife."
