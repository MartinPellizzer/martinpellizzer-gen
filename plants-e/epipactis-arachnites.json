It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, narrow leaves and a delicate, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive, spurred lip. Epipactis arachnites is a perennial species that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its complex ecological relationships."
