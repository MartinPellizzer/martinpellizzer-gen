    "intro": "Eriachne nana, commonly known as dwarf eriochne, is a small, perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers, which are clustered in dense, compact heads. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in coastal and inland regions. Eriachne nana is adapted to dry conditions and is considered a resilient plant in arid environments."
