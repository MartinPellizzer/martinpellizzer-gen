    "intro": "Encephalartos ngoyanus, commonly known as the Ngoyanu cycad, is a rare and endemic cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, woody female cones that develop into hard, spiny seed pods. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a semi-shaded to sunny environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is classified as vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
