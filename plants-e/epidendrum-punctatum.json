    "intro": "Epidendrum punctatum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching stems that bear numerous showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique spotted patterns on the leaves and flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
