    "intro": "Elatostema scabrum, commonly known as rough-stemmed elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, dry fruits. Elatostema scabrum is often found in rocky or forested areas and is adapted to thrive in humid conditions."
