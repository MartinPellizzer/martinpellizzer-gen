    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides var. normalis, commonly known as the \"Portulacoid Euphorbia,\" is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia (cup-like structures) that are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
