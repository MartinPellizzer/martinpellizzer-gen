    "intro": "Eragrostis tenella var. compacta, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
