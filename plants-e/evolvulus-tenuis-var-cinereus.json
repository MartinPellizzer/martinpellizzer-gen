    "intro": "Evolvulus tenuis var. cinereus, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous annual vine native to the southern United States. It features slender, hairy stems that climb by means of twining stems, often reaching lengths of up to 3 meters. The leaves are ovate to heart-shaped, with a distinctive silver or grayish-white underside, giving the plant its common name. Its small, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pale blue to white, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields."
