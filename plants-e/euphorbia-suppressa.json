    "intro": "Euphorbia suppressa, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, and often blue-green leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by colorful bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia suppressa is also noted for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
