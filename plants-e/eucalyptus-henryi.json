    "intro": "Eucalyptus henryi, commonly known as the Henry's gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that can range from white to pinkish in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. This species is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
