    "intro": "Erlangea richardsiae, commonly known as the Richardsia erlangii, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Erlangea richardsiae is considered endangered in its natural range."
