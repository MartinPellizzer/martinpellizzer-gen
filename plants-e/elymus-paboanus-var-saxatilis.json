    "intro": "Elymus paboanus var. saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This variety thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, typically found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, open panicle with spikelets that are often loosely arranged. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
