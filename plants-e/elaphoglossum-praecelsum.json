    "intro": "Elaphoglossum praecelsum, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright form. The plant features small, elliptical pinnae with a serrated margin, and its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across the Americas. Elaphoglossum praecelsum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
