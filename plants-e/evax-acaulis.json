    "intro": "Evax acaulis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, green, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers. Its flowers are typically followed by seed capsules that release wind-dispersed seeds. Evax acaulis is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
