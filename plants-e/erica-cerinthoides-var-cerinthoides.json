It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
