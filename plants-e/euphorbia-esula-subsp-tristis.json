    "intro": "Euphorbia esula subsp. tristis, commonly known as the Canadian tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a rosette of thick, waxy, and often blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
