It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Epilobium \u00d7 costeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
