    "intro": "Erythronium dens-canis var. purpureum, commonly known as the purple dog's tooth violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue and its nodding, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully expanded. It thrives in woodland and shady garden environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early-flowering display."
