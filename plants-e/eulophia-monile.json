    "intro": "Eulophia monile, commonly known as the bead orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for epiphytic growth on trees or rocks. Eulophia monile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
