    "intro": "Epidendrum crassum, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange, which bloom in racemes along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum crassum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
