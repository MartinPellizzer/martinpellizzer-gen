    "intro": "Eucalyptus decaisneana, commonly known as the De Caesne eucalyptus, is a tall, slender tree native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive blue-green color with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
