    "intro": "Elaphoglossum stigmatolepis, commonly known as the stigmatolepis holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its intricate leaf structure and unique spore arrangement make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
