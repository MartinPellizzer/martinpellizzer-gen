    "intro": "Engysiphon brevitubus, commonly known as the short-tubed engysiphon, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a short, tubular corolla that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth surface and a waxy cuticle. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Engysiphon brevitubus is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
