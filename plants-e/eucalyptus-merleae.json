    "intro": "Eucalyptus merleae, commonly known as the Merle's eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, grey, and green. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive blue-green hue. Eucalyptus merleae is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
