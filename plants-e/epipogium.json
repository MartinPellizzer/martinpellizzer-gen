    "intro": "Epipogium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. The plant lacks chlorophyll and has a pale, often white or pinkish appearance. It produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale green. Epipogium is typically found in shaded, moist forest environments, often growing on the roots of trees or in leaf litter."
