    "intro": "Euphorbia atoto, commonly known as the atoto spurge, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia atoto is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive in dry conditions. Its toxic sap contains irritants, so it should be handled with care."
