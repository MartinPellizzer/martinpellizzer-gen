    "intro": "Eustrephus latifolius var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate broadleaf euphorbia, is a variant of the broadleaf euphorbia species native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by prominent green bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
