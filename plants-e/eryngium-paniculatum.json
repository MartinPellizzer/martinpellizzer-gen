It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads that resemble thistle-like structures. The plant has silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Eryngium paniculatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
