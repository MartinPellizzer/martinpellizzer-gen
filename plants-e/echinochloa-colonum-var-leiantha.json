    "intro": "Echinochloa colonum var. leiantha, commonly known as yellow foxtail, is a grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and distinctive yellowish-green inflorescences that resemble a fox's tail. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It has narrow, linear leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This variant is often considered a weed but has ecological and historical significance in certain regions."
