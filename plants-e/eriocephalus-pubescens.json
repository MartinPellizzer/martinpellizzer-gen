    "intro": "Eriocephalus pubescens, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
