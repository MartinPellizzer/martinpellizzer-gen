    "intro": "Ephedra equisetina var. monoica, commonly known as the single-stem ephedra, is a member of the Ephedraceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has been the subject of both scientific study and regulatory scrutiny."
