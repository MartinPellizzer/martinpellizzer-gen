    "intro": "Eulychnia breviflora subsp. ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features a cylindrical, spiny stem that branches into dense, bushy clusters, adapted for water storage and reducing surface area to minimize water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that helps it thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and shorter, more robust branches compared to the typical form of E. breviflora."
