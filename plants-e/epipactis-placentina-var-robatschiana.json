    "intro": "Epipactis placentina var. robatschiana, commonly known as the Robatsch's marsh helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with distinct lip structures. This plant is typically found in wet meadows and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host through specialized roots. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
