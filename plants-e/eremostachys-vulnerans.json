    "intro": "Eremostachys vulnerans, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, hairy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep water sources. Eremostachys vulnerans is well-suited to xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal care requirements."
