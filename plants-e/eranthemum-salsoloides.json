    "intro": "Eranthemum salsoloides, commonly known as the desert rose or sand rose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
