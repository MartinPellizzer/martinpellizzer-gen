    "intro": "Elleanthus coriifolius, commonly known as the rough-leaved elleanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dark green, rough-textured leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Elleanthus coriifolius is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
