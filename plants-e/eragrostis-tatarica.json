    "intro": "Eragrostis tatarica, commonly known as Russian windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It features slender, tufted stems that often grow in dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow, hairy, and slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Eragrostis tatarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
