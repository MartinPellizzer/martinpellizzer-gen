    "intro": "Eucalyptus prominula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent and have been used in traditional medicine. Eucalyptus prominula is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
