    "intro": "Ericoides triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Ericoides triflorum plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
