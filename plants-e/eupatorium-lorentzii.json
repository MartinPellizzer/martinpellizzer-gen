It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant ecosystems and a potential candidate for wetland restoration projects."
