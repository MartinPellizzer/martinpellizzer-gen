    "intro": "Eryngium supinum, commonly known as the prostrate thistle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, compact form. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often sprawling or prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground. Eryngium supinum is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats."
