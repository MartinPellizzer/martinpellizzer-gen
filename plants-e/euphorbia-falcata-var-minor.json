    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf spearhead spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy stems and small, triangular leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
