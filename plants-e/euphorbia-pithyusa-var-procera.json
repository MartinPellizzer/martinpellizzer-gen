    "intro": "Euphorbia pithyusa var. procera, commonly known as the giant crown-of-thorns, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a unique, gelatinous cyathium, which is a type of floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions. Due to its sharp spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in xeriscaping."
