    "intro": "Eudianthe laeta, commonly known as the happy bell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a slight purple tinge. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces small, fragrant blooms during the spring and early summer. Eudianthe laeta thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and low maintenance requirements."
