    "intro": "Euphorbia nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silver rose or white spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
