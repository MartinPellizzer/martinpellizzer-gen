    "intro": "Epidendrum villegastigma, commonly known as the violet-flowered orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a short rhizome and numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid environments. It prefers partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
