    "intro": "Euphorbia rochaensis, commonly known as the Rocha's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its unique floral structures called cyathia. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia rochaensis is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and requires caution during handling."
