    "intro": "Edraianthus zogovicii, commonly known as the Zogovici's edraianthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
