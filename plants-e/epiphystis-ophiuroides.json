It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that form a dense, crown-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish spore cases called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Epiphystis ophiuroides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in indoor settings."
