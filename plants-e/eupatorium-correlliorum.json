    "intro": "Eupatorium correlliorum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fluffy blue-gray flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Blue mistflower is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
