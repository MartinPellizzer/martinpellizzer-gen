    "intro": "Euphorbia psammophila, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh desert environments through its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures to minimize water loss. Euphorbia psammophila is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
