    "intro": "Eucalyptus globulus subsp. pseudoglobulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peppermint gum, is a variant of the common eucalyptus found primarily in southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pink, which are typical of the eucalyptus genus. Its bark is smooth and peels off in strips, revealing a mottled pattern of green and grey underneath. This subspecies is valued for its aromatic oils, which are used in medicinal and industrial applications."
