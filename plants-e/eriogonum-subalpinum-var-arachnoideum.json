    "intro": "Eriogonum subalpinum var. arachnoideum, commonly known as the alpine goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid, high-altitude environments. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often requiring conservation efforts to protect its population."
