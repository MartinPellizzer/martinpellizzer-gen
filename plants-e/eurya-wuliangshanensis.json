It is native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in the Wuliangshan area of Sichuan Province. This evergreen shrub typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.
