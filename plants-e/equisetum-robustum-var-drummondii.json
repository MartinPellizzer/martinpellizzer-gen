    "intro": "Equisetum robustum var. drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's horsehair grass, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural fibers."
