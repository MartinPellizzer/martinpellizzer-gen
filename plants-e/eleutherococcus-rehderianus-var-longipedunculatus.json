    "intro": "Eleutherococcus rehderianus var. longipedunculatus, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Russia, China, and Korea. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is valued for its adaptogenic properties and is often used in traditional medicine."
