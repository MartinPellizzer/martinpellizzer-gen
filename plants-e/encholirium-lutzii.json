    "intro": "Encholirium lutzii, commonly known as the Lutz's orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Encholirium lutzii is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
