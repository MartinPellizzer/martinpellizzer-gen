    "intro": "Eumachia agustinae, commonly known as the tropical evergreen shrub, is a species native to the humid regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Its leaves are leathery and have a glossy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its native environment. Eumachia agustinae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
