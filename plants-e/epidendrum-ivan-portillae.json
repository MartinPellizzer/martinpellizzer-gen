    "intro": "Epidendrum ivan-portillae, commonly known as the Ivan Portillae Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and efficient water retention. This orchid is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
