    "intro": "Eriophyllum lanatum var. aphanactis, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. This variety is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, chaparral, and disturbed sites."
