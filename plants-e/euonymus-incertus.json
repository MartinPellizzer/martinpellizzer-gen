It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.
