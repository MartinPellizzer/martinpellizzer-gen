    "intro": "Epidryopteris, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface, aiding in water filtration and oxygenation. The leaves are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a water lily, and are often used in ornamental ponds. Epidryopteris species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and Africa. They play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water quality."
