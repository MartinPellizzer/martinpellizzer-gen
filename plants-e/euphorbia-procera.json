    "intro": "Euphorbia procera, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a reddish or greenish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem, making it drought-tolerant. Euphorbia procera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
