    "intro": "Elwendia vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Elwendia vaginata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
