    "intro": "Eurybia glauca, commonly known as blue mouse-ear, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features a basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Eurybia glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
