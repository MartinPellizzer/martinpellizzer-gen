    "intro": "Euphorbia abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, compact stem with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the growing season, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Euphorbia abbreviata is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
