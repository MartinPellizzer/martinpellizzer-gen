    "intro": "Endoptera aspera, commonly known as the rough-winged moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Noctuidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured wings that are usually a mix of brown and gray, providing effective camouflage in its natural habitat. The plant is native to various regions in Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in grassy and open areas. Its life cycle involves a larval stage that feeds on a variety of grasses and herbs. The adult moth is primarily active at night, and its flight patterns are often associated with the presence of its host plants."
