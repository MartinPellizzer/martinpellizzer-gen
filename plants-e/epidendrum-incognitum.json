    "intro": "Epidendrum incognitum, commonly known as the unknown epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, Epidendrum incognitum is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated orchid."
