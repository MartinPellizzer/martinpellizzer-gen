    "intro": "Euphorbia peperomioides, commonly known as the pencil cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features a unique, zigzagging stem structure that resembles a pencil, with small, rounded leaves along its ridges. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Due to its milky sap, it is important to handle the plant with care to avoid skin irritation."
