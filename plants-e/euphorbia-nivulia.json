    "intro": "Euphorbia nivulia, commonly known as the snow euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that resembles a cloud, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Euphorbia nivulia is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
