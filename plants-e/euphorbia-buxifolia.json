    "intro": "Euphorbia buxifolia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense, dark green foliage that resembles boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by colorful bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
