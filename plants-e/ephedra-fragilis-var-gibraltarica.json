    "intro": "Ephedra fragilis var. gibraltarica, commonly known as the Gibraltar ephedra, is a rare and small shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
