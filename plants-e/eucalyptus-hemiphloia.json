    "intro": "Eucalyptus hemiphloia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringybark, is a tall, slender eucalyptus tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in long, narrow strips, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery or greyish underside. It produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
