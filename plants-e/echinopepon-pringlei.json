    "intro": "Echinopepon pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's horned melon, is a unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit that resembles a melon with a horned appearance. The plant produces large, green, rough-skinned fruits that contain a sweet, edible pulp with black seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental and edible features, it is of interest to both horticulturists and botanists."
