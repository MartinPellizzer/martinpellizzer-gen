    "intro": "Elaeagnus macrantha, commonly known as the silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically harvested in late summer, though they are often used in traditional medicine. Elaeagnus macrantha is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its capacity to fix nitrogen, making it useful for soil improvement. Its ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
