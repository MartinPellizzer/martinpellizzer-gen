    "intro": "Epidendrum hygrohylephilum, commonly known as the humid forest epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation and moderate temperatures. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled greenhouse settings."
