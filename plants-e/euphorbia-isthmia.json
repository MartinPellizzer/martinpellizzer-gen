    "intro": "Euphorbia isthmia, commonly known as the Isthmian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean islands. It features a branched stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia isthmia is typically found in rocky or coastal areas where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
