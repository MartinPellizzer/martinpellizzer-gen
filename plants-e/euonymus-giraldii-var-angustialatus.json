    "intro": "Euonymus giraldii var. angustialatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
