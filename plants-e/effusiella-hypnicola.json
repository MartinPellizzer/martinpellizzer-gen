    "intro": "Effusiella hypnicola, commonly known as the moss cushion plant, is a small, low-growing moss that forms dense, cushion-like structures. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact growth habit with tightly packed shoots that help retain moisture. Its leaves are usually elongated and overlapping, contributing to its dense appearance. Effusiella hypnicola plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
