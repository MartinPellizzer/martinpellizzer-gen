    "intro": "Euphorbia neriifolia, commonly known as the blackleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
