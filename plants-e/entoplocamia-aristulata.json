    "intro": "Entoplocamia aristulata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many parts of the world."
