    "intro": "Erica medioliflora, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica medioliflora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
