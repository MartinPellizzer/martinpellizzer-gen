    "intro": "Eleocharis rostellata f. occidentalis, commonly known as the western spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, spikelet-like clusters. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in temperate climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The species is notable for its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems and its role in water filtration and erosion control."
