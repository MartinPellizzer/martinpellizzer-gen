    "intro": "Escallonia serrata var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf escallonia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a fine serration along the edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its dense growth habit and ornamental foliage make it an excellent specimen plant for smaller spaces."
