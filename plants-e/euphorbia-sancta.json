    "intro": "Euphorbia sancta, commonly known as the sacred euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves that help it store water. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Euphorbia sancta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
