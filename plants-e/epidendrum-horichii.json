    "intro": "Epidendrum horichii, commonly known as the Horichii Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
