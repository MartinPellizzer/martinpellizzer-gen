    "intro": "Echinocereus arizonicus subsp. matudae, commonly known as the Matudae prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible, red to purple fruits known as \"tunas,\" which are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
