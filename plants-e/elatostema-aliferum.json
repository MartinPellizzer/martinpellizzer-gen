    "intro": "Elatostema aliferum, commonly known as the silverleaf stinging plant, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes many stinging plants, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Despite its common name, it is not typically considered a weed and has limited use in traditional medicine."
