    "intro": "Erica turgida, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, compact foliage that is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring and early summer. Erica turgida is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for local pollinators."
