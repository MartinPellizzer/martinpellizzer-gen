    "intro": "Euphorbia angolensis, commonly known as the Angola spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
