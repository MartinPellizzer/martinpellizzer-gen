    "intro": "Eriocaulon tricornum, commonly known as the three-angled spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in tight spikes, and are pollinated by wind or insects. Eriocaulon tricornum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
