    "intro": "Euphorbiodendron latazi, commonly known as the Latazi euphorbia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the wet season, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are often woody and can branch out to form a compact, shrub-like structure. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
