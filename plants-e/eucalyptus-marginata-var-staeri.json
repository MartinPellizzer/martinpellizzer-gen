    "intro": "Eucalyptus marginata var. staeri, commonly known as the King River gum, is a rare and critically endangered variant of the marginata species. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant is native to the southern regions of Western Australia, where it grows in coastal and near-coastal areas. It produces small, white or cream-colored flowers during the winter months, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
