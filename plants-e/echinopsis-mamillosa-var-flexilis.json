    "intro": "Echinopsis mamillosa var. flexilis, commonly known as the Flexilis Cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with ribbed structure and spines that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
