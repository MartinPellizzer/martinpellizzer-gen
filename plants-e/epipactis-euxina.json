    "intro": "Epipactis euxina, commonly known as the Balkan helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Europe and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a tall stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates. Epipactis euxina is an herbaceous perennial that produces a single, erect flower spike during the spring and early summer. Its pollination is primarily achieved through specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
