    "intro": "Eriocaulon monoscapum, commonly known as the single-stemmed marsh grass, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of tiny, spike-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Eriocaulon monoscapum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
