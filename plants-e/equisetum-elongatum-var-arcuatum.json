    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. arcuatum, commonly known as the nodding scouring rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, unbranched stems that are covered with small, scale-like structures called annular rings. The plant produces spore-bearing strobili, or cones, at the top of the stem, which are often curved or nodding in appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is typically found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
