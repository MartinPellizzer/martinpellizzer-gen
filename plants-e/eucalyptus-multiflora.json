    "intro": "Eucalyptus multiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallet, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, are widely used in medicinal and aromatic applications. Eucalyptus multiflora is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
