    "intro": "Euphorbia woodii, commonly known as the \"living fossil\" or \"woodii's euphorbia,\" is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Caucasus region. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a distinctive, branched structure and a lack of true leaves. Euphorbia woodii is adapted to arid environments, with its succulent tissues storing water to survive in dry conditions. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is highly protected and rarely found in the wild."
