    "intro": "Encyclia chloroleuca var. rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often display a reddish hue, particularly in younger growth. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow lips, typical of the Epidendroideae subfamily. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings."
