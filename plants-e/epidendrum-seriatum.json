It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically has dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum seriatum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
