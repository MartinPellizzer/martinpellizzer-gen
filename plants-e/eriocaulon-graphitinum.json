It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that resembles a carpet on the water's surface. The plant has slender, branching stems with tiny, scale-like leaves that help it float and absorb nutrients efficiently. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and wetlands. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
