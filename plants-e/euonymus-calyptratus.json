    "intro": "Euonymus calyptratus, commonly known as the red-fruit euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a reddish tint during the growing season. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits that mature in the fall. These fruits are edible for birds and small mammals, contributing to the plant's role in local ecosystems. Euonymus calyptratus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
