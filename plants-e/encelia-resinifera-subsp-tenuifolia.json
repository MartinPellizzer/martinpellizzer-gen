    "intro": "Encelia resinifera subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf brittlebush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that produce a resinous sap, which contributes to its common name. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. The subspecies tenuifolia is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other subspecies of Encelia resinifera."
