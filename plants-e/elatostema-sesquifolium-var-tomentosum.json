    "intro": "Elatostema sesquifolium var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly leaf stellaria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its small, hairy, and often glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky slopes, and is native to regions of Southeast Asia. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. The variety tomentosum is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence, which provides protection against herbivory and environmental stress."
