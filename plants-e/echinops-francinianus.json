It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sunlight. Its flowers are blue to purple in color and bloom during the summer months. Echinops francinianus is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought-resistant properties."
