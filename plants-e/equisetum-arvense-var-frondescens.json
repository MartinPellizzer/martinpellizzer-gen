    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. frondescens, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This plant is typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as those in fields, along roadsides, and in wetlands. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its growth is often associated with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil. The plant has a distinctive appearance and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique foliage."
