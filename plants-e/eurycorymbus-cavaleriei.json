    "intro": "Eurycorymbus cavaleriei, commonly known as the Yunnan daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
