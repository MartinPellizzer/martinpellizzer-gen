    "intro": "Euphorbia spinosa subsp. melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Malta and surrounding islands. It features a thick, branching stem covered in spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
