    "intro": "Erica inermis, commonly known as the white heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erica inermis is evergreen, with dense, needle-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
