    "intro": "Echinopsis johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, with a distinctive, star-shaped appearance. Echinopsis johnsonii is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
