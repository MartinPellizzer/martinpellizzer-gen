    "intro": "Epigeneium annamense, commonly known as the Annam epiphyte, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Laos, it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered white flowers. It is often found in mountainous regions, typically in the canopy of rainforests."
