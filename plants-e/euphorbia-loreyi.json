    "intro": "Euphorbia loreyi, commonly known as the Lorey's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with paired, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
