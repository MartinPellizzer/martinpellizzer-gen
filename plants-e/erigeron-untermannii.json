It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and its flowers are blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erigeron untermannii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
