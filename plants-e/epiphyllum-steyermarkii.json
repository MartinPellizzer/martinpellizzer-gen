    "intro": "Epiphyllum steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's orchid cactus, is a fascinating epiphytic cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that resemble leaves, which are actually modified stems adapted for storing water. The plant produces showy, night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or white, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and blooming habits, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of unusual succulents."
