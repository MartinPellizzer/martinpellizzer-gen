It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine silvery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Euploca epacridea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
