    "intro": "Elaphrium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elaphrium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white in color and appear in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
