    "intro": "Espeletia arborea, commonly known as the tree heather, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Espeletia arborea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
