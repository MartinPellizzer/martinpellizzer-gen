It is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble bamboo. The plant produces inflorescences consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often found in mangrove swamps and coastal areas. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
