    "intro": "Elymus wawawaiensis, commonly known as the Wawawai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Elymus wawawaiensis plays an important ecological role by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in rocky environments. Its flowering heads consist of dense, spike-like clusters of small, wind-pollinated flowers."
