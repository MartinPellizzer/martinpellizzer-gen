    "intro": "Eriocaulon separatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh plant, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense clusters near the water's edge. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by a dense cluster of white or pale green bracts. It is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can survive in both submerged and emergent conditions. Eriocaulon separatum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
