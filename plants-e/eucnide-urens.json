    "intro": "Eucnide urens, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in dry conditions by efficiently absorbing water. Eucnide urens is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation."
