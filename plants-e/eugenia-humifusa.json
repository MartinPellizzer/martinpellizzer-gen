It typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters and has dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Eugenia humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
