    "intro": "Eleutherococcus setosus, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5\u20139 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is valued in traditional medicine for its adaptogenic properties, which are believed to enhance physical and mental performance. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and shaded environments."
