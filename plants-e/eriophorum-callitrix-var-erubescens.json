    "intro": "Eriophorum callitrix var. erubescens, commonly known as the redstem cottongrass, is a flowering plant species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that appear during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wetland habitats. Its leaves are grass-like and form a rosette structure, while the inflorescence consists of numerous small, white to reddish flowers. This variety is notable for its striking coloration and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
