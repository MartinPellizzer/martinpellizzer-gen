It features small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
