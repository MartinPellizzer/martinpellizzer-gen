    "intro": "Euphorbia brevis, commonly known as the short euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and fleshy, green stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically short and spiny, providing a protective mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia brevis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
