    "intro": "Encyclia pipio, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid forest environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers have a unique structure with a pouch-like lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
