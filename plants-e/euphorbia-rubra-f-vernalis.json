    "intro": "Euphorbia rubra f. vernalis, commonly known as the spring euphorbia, is a compact, low-growing plant with a unique botanical structure. It features a fleshy, cylindrical stem that is typically reddish in color, which helps it store water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate and often reduced to small, scale-like structures. This succulent thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
