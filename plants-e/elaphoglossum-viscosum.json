    "intro": "Elaphoglossum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky elaphoglossum, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum viscosum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory plant communities."
