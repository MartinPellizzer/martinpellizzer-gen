    "intro": "Eleocharis valleculosa f. setosa, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets with short, hairy bracts. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. Its morphology includes slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters. This fern-like plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
