    "intro": "Elaphoglossum venustum, commonly known as the golden elaphoglossum, is a fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a unique, cup-like indusium. Elaphoglossum venustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
