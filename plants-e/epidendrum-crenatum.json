    "intro": "Epidendrum crenatum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that often have a wavy or zigzag margin. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, well-drained environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Epidendrum crenatum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
