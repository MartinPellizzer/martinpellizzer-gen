    "intro": "Encyclia oncidioides var. profusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the plant. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red markings, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, helping it store water in its native, often arid or seasonal habitats. The leaves are broad, strap-shaped, and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
