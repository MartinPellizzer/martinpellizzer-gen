    "intro": "Echium pininana, commonly known as the Canary Islands spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, coastal areas. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echium pininana is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
