    "intro": "Euphorbia cussonioides, commonly known as the Cape Harebell, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and green, which appear in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
