    "intro": "Euonymus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which is more commonly associated with gourds and cucumbers, making it an unusual member of that family. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
