It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its flowers are characterized by their distinctive, broad bracts that surround the floral clusters. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
