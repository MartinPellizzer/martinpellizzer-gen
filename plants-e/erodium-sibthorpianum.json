    "intro": "Erodium sibthorpianum, commonly known as the sibthorpian stickywheel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small annual herb with hairy, erect stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences called scorpioid cymes. Its fruit is a dry capsule that dehisces to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Erodium sibthorpianum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
