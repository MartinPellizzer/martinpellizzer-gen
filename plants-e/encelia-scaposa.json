    "intro": "Encelia scaposa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Encelia scaposa has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
