It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Epilobium leiophyton is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in wetland environments."
