It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
