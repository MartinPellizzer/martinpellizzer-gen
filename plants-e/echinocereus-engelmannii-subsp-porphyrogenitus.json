    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. porphyrogenitus, commonly known as the Porphyrogeneous Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spiny cactus with cylindrical stems that often branch at the base. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
