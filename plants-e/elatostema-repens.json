    "intro": "Elatostema repens, commonly known as the creeping elatostema, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes plants commonly known as nettles. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny greenish-white flowers. Elatostema repens typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat."
