    "intro": "Epilobium montanum f. verticillatum, commonly known as the mountain willow or alpine willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sometimes branched stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in whorls along the stems, a feature that distinguishes this form from other epilobium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
