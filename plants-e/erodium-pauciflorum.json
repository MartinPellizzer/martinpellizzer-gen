    "intro": "Erodium pauciflorum, commonly known as the lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and short life cycle, it plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
