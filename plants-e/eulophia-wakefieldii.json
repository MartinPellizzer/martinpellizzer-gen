    "intro": "Eulophia wakefieldii, commonly known as Wakefield's eulophia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. Eulophia wakefieldii thrives in humid, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories."
