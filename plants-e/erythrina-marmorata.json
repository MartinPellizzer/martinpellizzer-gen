    "intro": "Erythrina marmorata, commonly known as the marble coral tree, is a tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with a distinctive marbled pattern of green and white. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Erythrina marmorata has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
