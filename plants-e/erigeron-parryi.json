    "intro": "Erigeron parryi, commonly known as Parry's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Erigeron parryi is often found in open areas such as grasslands and along streambanks."
