    "intro": "Elymus canadensis f. crescendus, commonly known as Canada wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife."
