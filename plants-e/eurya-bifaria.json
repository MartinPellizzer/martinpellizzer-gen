It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are elliptical with two distinct lobes at the base, giving it its common name. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and appear in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species."
