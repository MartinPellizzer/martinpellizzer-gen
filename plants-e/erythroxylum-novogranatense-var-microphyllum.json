    "intro": "Erythroxylum novogranatense var. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf coca plant, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, ribbed berries containing elliptical seeds. It is closely related to the coca plant and shares similar botanical features, though it is generally smaller in stature. Due to its genetic similarity to E. coca, it is sometimes considered a variant or closely related species within the Erythroxylum genus."
