    "intro": "Echinops choetocephalus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a spiky ball, which are a key feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Echinops choetocephalus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
