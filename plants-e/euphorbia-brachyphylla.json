    "intro": "Euphorbia brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
