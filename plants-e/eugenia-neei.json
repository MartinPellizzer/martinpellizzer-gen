    "intro": "Eugenia neei, commonly known as the mountain eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features elliptical, leathery leaves with a glossy dark green surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Eugenia neei is characterized by its dense branching pattern and is often found in moist, shaded environments within its native habitat. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
