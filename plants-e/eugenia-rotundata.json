It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 6 meters. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. The fruit is a small, round, fleshy berry that turns red when mature and is often used in local cuisines or traditional medicine."
