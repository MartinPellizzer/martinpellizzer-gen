It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight. Echeveria secunda is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
