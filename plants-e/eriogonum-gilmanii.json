    "intro": "Eriogonum gilmanii, commonly known as Gilman's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum gilmanii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a common species in chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
