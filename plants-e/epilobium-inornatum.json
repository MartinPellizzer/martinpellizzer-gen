It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant features showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Epilobium inornatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
