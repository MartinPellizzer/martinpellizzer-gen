    "intro": "Ehretia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered ehretia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
