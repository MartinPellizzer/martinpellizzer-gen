    "intro": "Elatostema tenuicornutum, commonly known as the slender-horned elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Elatostema tenuicornutum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to low-light conditions and nutrient-poor soils."
