    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides subsp. melillensis, commonly known as the Melillan euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. It features a compact, branched stem covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
