    "intro": "Elaeocarpus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud forest elaeocarpus, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Due to its habitat specificity, Elaeocarpus nubigenus plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native cloud forest ecosystems."
