    "intro": "Euphorbia missurica var. typica, commonly known as the Missourian spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features a succulent, branching stem covered in small, green, leaf-like structures. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower-like structures, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia missurica var. typica is notable for its ability to store water in its stems, adapting to arid environments."
