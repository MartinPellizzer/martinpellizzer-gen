    "intro": "Eriophorum tenellum f. gorhami, commonly known as the dwarf cottongrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. It produces fluffy, white to pale pink seed heads that resemble cotton, which are characteristic of the Carex family. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. It typically blooms in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often found in northern regions and is an important component of peatland ecosystems."
