    "intro": "Euphorbia lydenburgensis var. lydenburgensis, commonly known as the Lydenburg euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
