    "intro": "Escobaria cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Cuba. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and fleshy, spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Escobaria cubensis is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental appearance."
