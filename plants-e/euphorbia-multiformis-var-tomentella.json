    "intro": "Euphorbia multiformis var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or sandy environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
