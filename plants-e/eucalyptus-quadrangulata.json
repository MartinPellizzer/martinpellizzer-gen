    "intro": "Eucalyptus quadrangulata, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a rough, textured surface. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant is well adapted to dry and sandy soils, making it a common sight in heathlands and open woodlands."
