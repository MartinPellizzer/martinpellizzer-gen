    "intro": "Epidendrum oxapampense, commonly known as the Oxapampa orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
