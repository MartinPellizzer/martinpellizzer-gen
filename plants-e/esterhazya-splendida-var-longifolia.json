    "intro": "Esterhazya splendida var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf esterhazya, is a striking perennial plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections. The varietal form, longifolia, is distinguished by its elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Esterhazya splendida."
