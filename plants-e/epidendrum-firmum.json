    "intro": "Epidendrum firmum, commonly known as the firm epiphyte, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often humid and shady habitat. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with a distinctive yellow lip, and it produces numerous small, fragrant blooms. Epidendrum firmum is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
