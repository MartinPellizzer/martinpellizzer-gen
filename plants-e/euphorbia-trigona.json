    "intro": "Euphorbia trigona, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, triangular stems and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
