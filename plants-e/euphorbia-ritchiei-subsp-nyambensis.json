    "intro": "Euphorbia ritchiei subsp. nyambensis, commonly known as the Nyambensis spurges, is a succulent plant native to parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions and is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
