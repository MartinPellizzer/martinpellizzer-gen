    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca var. phoeniceum, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. It is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. The golden globemallow plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appearance in native plant gardens."
