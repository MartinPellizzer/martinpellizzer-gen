    "intro": "Elatostema parvum var. brevicuspis, commonly known as the small-leaved elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its inflorescence consists of clustered, small white or pale pink flowers. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variant is distinguished by its short, bluntly pointed leaf tips, which contribute to its specific botanical classification."
