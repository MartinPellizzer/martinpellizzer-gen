    "intro": "Ebraxis muscipula, commonly known as the Venus' Claw, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features intricate, lobster-claw shaped traps that snap shut to capture prey, showcasing its specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers are small and pale green, blending with the surrounding vegetation. Ebraxis muscipula thrives in nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey to supplement its nutritional needs."
