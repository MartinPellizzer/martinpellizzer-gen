    "intro": "Echinopsis trollii, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that are often adorned with vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms during the holiday season, hence its common name. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, and it stores water in its fleshy tissue to survive in arid conditions. Echinopsis trollii prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
