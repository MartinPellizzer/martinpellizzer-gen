    "intro": "Eupatorium riparium, commonly known as water boneset, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered white to pale purple flowers. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, attracting various pollinators. Eupatorium riparium is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
