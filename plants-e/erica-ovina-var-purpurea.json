    "intro": "Erica ovina var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern England. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flower colors. Erica ovina var. purpurea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
