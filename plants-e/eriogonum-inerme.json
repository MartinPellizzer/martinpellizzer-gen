It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive, ribbed stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually pale green to reddish in color. Eriogonum inerme is an important plant for pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
