It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted culms and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
