    "intro": "Eudianthe coeli-rosa var. speciosa, commonly known as the showy sky-blue bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, often with a white or pale pink throat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
