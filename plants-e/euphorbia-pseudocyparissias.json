    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudocyparissias, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branched stems covered in a waxy, blue-green cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slight hairiness, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Euphorbia pseudocyparissias is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
