It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are often clasping, wrapping around the stems, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Epistephium amplexicaule is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas."
