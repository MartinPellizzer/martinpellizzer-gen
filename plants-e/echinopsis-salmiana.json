    "intro": "Echinopsis salmiana, commonly known as the Salmiana cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking white to yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Echinopsis salmiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
