    "intro": "Eupatorium turquinense, commonly known as the Turquin's boneset, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eupatorium turquinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
