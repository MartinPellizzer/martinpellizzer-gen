    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 hawkeri, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a hybrid species originating from crosses between Eucalyptus robusta and Eucalyptus camaldulensis. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, globular white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. This species is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of climates, though it prefers well-drained soils and full sun."
