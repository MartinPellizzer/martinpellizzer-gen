    "intro": "Ethulia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly ethulia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Ethulia tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
