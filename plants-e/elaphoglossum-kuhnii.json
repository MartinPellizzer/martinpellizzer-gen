    "intro": "Elaphoglossum kuhnii, commonly known as the Kuhn's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum kuhnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
