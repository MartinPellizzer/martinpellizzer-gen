    "intro": "Echidnopsis cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. This plant is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are often pale green or white, resembling the ghostly appearance for which it is named. It thrives in rocky outcrops and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
