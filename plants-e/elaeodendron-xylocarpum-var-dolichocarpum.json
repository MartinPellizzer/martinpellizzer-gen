    "intro": "Elaeodendron xylocarpum var. dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-seeded elaeodendron, is a rare tropical plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive, elongated fruits that contain the seeds. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a glossy surface that aids in photosynthesis. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
