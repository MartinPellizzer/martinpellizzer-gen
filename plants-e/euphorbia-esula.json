    "intro": "Euphorbia esula, commonly known as yellow-spined spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
