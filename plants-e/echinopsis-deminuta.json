    "intro": "Echinopsis deminuta, commonly known as the \"Lace Flower\" or \"Palo de Tinta,\" is a cacti species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a spiny exterior, with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
