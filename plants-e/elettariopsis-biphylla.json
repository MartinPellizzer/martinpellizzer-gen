    "intro": "Elettariopsis biphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved elettariopsis, is a rare and unique flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its distinct two-leaved structure, with the lower leaf being significantly larger than the upper one. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within dense forests. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Elettariopsis biphylla is considered a species of conservation concern."
