    "intro": "Euphorbia scoparia, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in hot, dry environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, fleshy leaves store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
