It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru, where it grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its fruits are capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
