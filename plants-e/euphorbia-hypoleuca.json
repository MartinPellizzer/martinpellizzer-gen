    "intro": "Euphorbia hypoleuca, commonly known as the pale milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a waxy coating, aiding in water conservation in arid environments. Euphorbia hypoleuca is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in regions with low precipitation."
