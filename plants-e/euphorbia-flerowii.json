    "intro": "Euphorbia flerowii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its thick, often branched stems and waxy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and has a milky sap that can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia flerowii is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping."
