It is characterized by its globular, yellow flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish bracts beneath the flowers. This subspecies is part of the legume family and is adapted to arid environments with deep root systems for water absorption."
