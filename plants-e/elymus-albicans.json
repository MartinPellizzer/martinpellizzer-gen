    "intro": "Elymus albicans, commonly known as white wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in early summer. Elymus albicans is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. It is valued for its resilience and has been used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
