    "intro": "Evolvulus hederaceus, commonly known as the creeping blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
