    "intro": "Eriogonum alatum subsp. triste, commonly known as the Desert Flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native range."
