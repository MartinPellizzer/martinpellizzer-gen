    "intro": "Euphorbia longicornuta, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem covered in spiny, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a fleshy, orange-colored cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
