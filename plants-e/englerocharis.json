    "intro": "Englerocharis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Englerocharis is known for its unique, delicate appearance and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
