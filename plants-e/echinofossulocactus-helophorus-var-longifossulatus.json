    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus helophorus var. longifossulatus, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in long, sharp spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its growth habit is typically solitary or in small clusters, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
