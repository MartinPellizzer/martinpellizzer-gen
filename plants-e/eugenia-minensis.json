It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when ripe, containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
