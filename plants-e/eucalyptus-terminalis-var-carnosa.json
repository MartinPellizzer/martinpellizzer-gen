    "intro": "Eucalyptus terminalis var. carnosa, commonly known as the woolly gum, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a thick layer of white to greyish hairs. It produces small, globular yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
