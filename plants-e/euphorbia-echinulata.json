    "intro": "Euphorbia echinulata, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in small, spiny protrusions. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its sharp spines, it requires careful handling to avoid injury."
