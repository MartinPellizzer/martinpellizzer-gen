    "intro": "Eleutheranthera, commonly known as the star sapphire, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble stars. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue or violet flowers. Eleutheranthera species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral display."
