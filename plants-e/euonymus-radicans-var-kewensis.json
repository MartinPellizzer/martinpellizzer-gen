It features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to reveal bright red seeds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or trellises. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, decorative plant."
