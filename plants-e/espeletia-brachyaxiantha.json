    "intro": "Espeletia brachyaxiantha, commonly known as the short-axile espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its rosette-like growth pattern and silver-gray foliage help it retain moisture and withstand harsh climatic conditions. This species plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small organisms."
