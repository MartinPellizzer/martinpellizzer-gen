    "intro": "Epidendrum tetragonum, commonly known as the Quadrangular Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, cane-like stems and broad, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum tetragonum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
