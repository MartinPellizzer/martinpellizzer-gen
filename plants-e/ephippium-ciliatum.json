    "intro": "Ephippium ciliatum, commonly known as the silky ciliate, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a soft, silvery appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Ephippium ciliatum is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
