    "intro": "Ekmaniopappus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant also produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures that aid in wind dispersal."
