It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Euonymus sieboldianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
