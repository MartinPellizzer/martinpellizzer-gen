    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 barlae, commonly known as the hybrid green orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive greenish-yellow flower spike that typically blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. This hybrid is found in moist, shaded habitats across Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
