    "intro": "Ehretia campestris, commonly known as the field ehretia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardening in warm climates. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for landscape design in suitable environments."
