    "intro": "Escobedia linearis, commonly known as the linear escobedia, is a rare and delicate lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its intricate, branched thallus with a pale to yellowish-green coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, typical of lichens. It is often found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
