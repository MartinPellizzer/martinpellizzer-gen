    "intro": "Echinopsis yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its columnar stem and spiny, globular flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments at high altitudes. Its flowers are often white or pale pink, and they emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
