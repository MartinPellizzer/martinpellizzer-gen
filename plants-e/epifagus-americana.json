    "intro": "Epifagus americana, commonly known as the American beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by triangular, winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Epifagus americana plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
