    "intro": "Elymus chinensis, commonly known as Chinese needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to China and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Elymus chinensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
