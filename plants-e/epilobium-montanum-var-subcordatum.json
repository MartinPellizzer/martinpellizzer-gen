It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, characterized by its preference for well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features erect, branched stems that are often covered in glandular hairs. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy surface and a subcordate base. The flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, producing showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer."
