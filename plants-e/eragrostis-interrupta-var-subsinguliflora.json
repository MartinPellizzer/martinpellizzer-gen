    "intro": "Eragrostis interrupta var. subsinguliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is noted for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
