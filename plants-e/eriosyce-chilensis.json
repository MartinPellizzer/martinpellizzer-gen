    "intro": "Eriosyce chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean woolly cactus, is a species of cactus native to Chile. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that covers its stems. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, where it adapts to extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its stems are cylindrical and often branched, and they store water to help the plant survive in harsh conditions. The flowers, which are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, appear at the tips of the stems and are adapted for pollination by insects."
