    "intro": "Erodium praecox var. baeticum, commonly known as the Iberian bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in Spain and Portugal. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in rocky areas and along roadsides, contributing to the local flora in Mediterranean regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently."
