    "intro": "Eleocharis tetraquetra var. micranthera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy in wetland flora. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
