    "intro": "Ervum ludovicianum, commonly known as the wild cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used as a food source by both humans and wildlife. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Botanically, it is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
