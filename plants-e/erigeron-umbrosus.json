    "intro": "Erigeron umbrosus, commonly known as the shadowy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a grayish or blue-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Erigeron umbrosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
