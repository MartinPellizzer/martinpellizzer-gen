    "intro": "[WRONG START] Embilia basaal, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, orange-red berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine for their antioxidant properties. The plant's botanical features make it well-suited for cultivation in humid, tropical climates."
