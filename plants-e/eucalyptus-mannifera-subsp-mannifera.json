    "intro": "Eucalyptus mannifera subsp. mannifera, commonly known as the honey gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a vibrant yellow-green color beneath. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a prominent midrib, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to cream, arranged in clusters, and attract a variety of pollinators. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
