    "intro": "Echinopsis spachiana, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Echinopsis spachiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
