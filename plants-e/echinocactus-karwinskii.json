    "intro": "Echinocactus karwinskii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white bristles. The plant's most distinctive feature is its dense covering of golden-yellow spines, which give it its common name. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, typically in clusters at the top of the stem. This slow-growing cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
