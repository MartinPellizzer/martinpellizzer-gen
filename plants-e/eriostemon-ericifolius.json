    "intro": "Eriostemon ericifolius, commonly known as the silver-leafed eriostemon, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
