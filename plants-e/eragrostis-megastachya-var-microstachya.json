    "intro": "Eragrostis megastachya var. microstachya, commonly known as narrow-stemmed lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
