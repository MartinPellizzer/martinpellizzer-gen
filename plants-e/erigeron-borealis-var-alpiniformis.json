    "intro": "Erigeron borealis var. alpiniformis, commonly known as the alpine fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas across Canada and the northern United States."
