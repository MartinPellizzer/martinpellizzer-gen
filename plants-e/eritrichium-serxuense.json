    "intro": "Eritrichium serxuense, commonly known as the Tibetan blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate blue or purple flowers and hairy leaves adapted to cold, arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Eritrichium serxuense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
