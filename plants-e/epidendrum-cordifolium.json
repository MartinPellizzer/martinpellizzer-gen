    "intro": "Epidendrum cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
