    "intro": "Eriosema campestre var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf eriosema, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun to partial shade."
