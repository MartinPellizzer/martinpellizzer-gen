    "intro": "Erysimum montanum, commonly known as the mountain mustard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Erysimum montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and resilience."
