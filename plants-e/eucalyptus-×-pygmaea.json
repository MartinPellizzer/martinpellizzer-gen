    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 pygmaea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus nicholii and Eucalyptus ovata, showcasing a mix of characteristics from both parents. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fluffy white flowers that appear in clusters. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
