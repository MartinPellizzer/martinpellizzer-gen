    "intro": "Euphorbia miricornis, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, spiny, and branched stems that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Euphorbia miricornis is often cultivated for its striking appearance and hardy nature."
