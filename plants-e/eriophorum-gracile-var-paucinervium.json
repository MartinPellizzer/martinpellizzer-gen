    "intro": "Eriophorum gracile var. paucinervium, commonly known as the slender cotton grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and fluffy, white seed heads. It is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs, marshes, and heathlands. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, clustered flowers that develop into the distinctive cotton-like seeds. Its leaves are usually slender and have few veins, which is reflected in its scientific name. This variant is part of the Cyperaceae family, known for its grass-like appearance and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
