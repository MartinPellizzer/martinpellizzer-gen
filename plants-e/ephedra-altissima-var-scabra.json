    "intro": "Ephedra altissima var. scabra, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub-like plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems that are often covered in a rough, scaly bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by reddish-brown, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme heat and drought conditions. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has also been studied for its potential pharmacological properties."
