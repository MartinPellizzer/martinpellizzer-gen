    "intro": "Erodium marocanum, commonly known as the Moroccan bird's-beak, is a flowering plant native to North Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open to release the seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Fabaceae family. Erodium marocanum is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
