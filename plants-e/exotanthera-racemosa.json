    "intro": "Exotanthera racemosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically valued for its use in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
