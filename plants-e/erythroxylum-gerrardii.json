    "intro": "Erythroxylum gerrardii, commonly known as the Mexican red pepper, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits containing elliptical seeds. Erythroxylum gerrardii is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage rather than its fruits."
