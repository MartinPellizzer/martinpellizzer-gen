    "intro": "Echium vahlii, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, capsule-like structure that aids in dispersal by wind or animals. Echium vahlii is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
