    "intro": "Epidendrum guagra-urcuense, commonly known as the Urcuense Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, a common adaptation in epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, helping it survive in dry conditions. Epidendrum guagra-urcuense is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments."
