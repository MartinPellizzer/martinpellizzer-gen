    "intro": "Ephedra microbracteata, commonly known as the small-bract ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in small, branched inflorescences. Ephedra microbracteata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent stems, which store water. It is also known for containing ephedrine, a compound with medicinal properties, though its use is regulated due to potential toxicity."
