    "intro": "Eugenia pterocaulis, commonly known as the broad-leafed eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, bright red berries. Its botanical features include a woody structure with thick, corky bark and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Eugenia pterocaulis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
