It features slender, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, pointed, and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for arid landscapes."
