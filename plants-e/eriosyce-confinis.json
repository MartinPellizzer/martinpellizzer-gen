    "intro": "Eriosyce confinis, commonly known as the velvet cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which gives it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant typically grows as a low, compact shrub with short, cylindrical stems that are often branched. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Eriosyce confinis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions."
