It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the nodes, and its inflorescence consists of racemes of small, pale green to brown flowers. It is an invasive species in many regions, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. Signal grass is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
