    "intro": "Euonymus alatus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the winged euonymus or the burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems and opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its vibrant autumn foliage. This variety is more shrub-like than its closely related species, with larger, broader leaves that contribute to its visual appeal."
