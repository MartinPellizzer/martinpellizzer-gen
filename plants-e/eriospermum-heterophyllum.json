It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. Eriospermum heterophyllum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and drought tolerance."
