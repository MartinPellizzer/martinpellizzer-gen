    "intro": "Eurya cuneata var. cuneata, commonly known as the broadleaf eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually 5 to 10 centimeters long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade."
