    "intro": "Eriachne ecklonii, commonly known as the Cape York grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and dunes. Eriachne ecklonii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
