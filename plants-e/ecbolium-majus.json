    "intro": "Ecbolium majus, commonly known as the giant ecbolium, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to one meter in length, and its showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike. However, due to habitat loss and limited propagation, it is considered endangered in the wild."
