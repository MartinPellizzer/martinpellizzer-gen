    "intro": "Eucalyptus hemiphloia var. parviflora, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Manna Gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery bloom. The species produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin sheets, revealing a mottled pattern of white and grey. This variety is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
