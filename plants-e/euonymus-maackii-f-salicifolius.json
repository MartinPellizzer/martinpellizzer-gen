    "intro": "Euonymus maackii f. salicifolius, commonly known as the willow-leaf boxwood, is a horticultural form of Euonymus maackii, characterized by its distinctive, elongated, willow-like leaves. This plant is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The leaves are typically dark green with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant produces small, red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit and year-round foliage. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
