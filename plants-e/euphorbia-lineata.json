    "intro": "Euphorbia lineata, commonly known as the zigzag holly or zigzag euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that are covered in short, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia lineata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
