    "intro": "Eriogonum strictum var. anserinum, commonly known as the snowbrush evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions."
