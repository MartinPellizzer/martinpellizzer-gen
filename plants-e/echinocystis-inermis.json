    "intro": "Echinocystis inermis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces green, spiny fruits that contain kidney-shaped seeds. Native to the Americas, it is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
