    "intro": "Eugenia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf eugenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red when ripe. Eugenia venosa is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
