    "intro": "Eupatorium paradoxum, commonly known as the paradox grass or false blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers that bloom from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Eupatorium paradoxum is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
