    "intro": "Elaeocarpus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf elaeocarpus, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 3 meters, with a dense canopy and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that are covered in a thick, sticky resin. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a leathery texture and a glossy surface. Elaeocarpus nanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact size and aesthetic foliage."
