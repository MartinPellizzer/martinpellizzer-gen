    "intro": "Eriogonum wrightii var. pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and canyon walls. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Pringle's buckwheat is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
