    "intro": "Ennearina pleiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ennearina pleiana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands."
