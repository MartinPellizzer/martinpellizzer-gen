    "intro": "Eriophorum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf cottongrass, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate and Arctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
