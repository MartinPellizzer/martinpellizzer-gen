    "intro": "Eutacta cookii var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leafed eutacta, is a rare and striking plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other notable species like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
