    "intro": "Eugenia inconspicua, commonly known as the small-leaved guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It produces small, edible fruits that are typically not as widely cultivated as other guava species. Eugenia inconspicua is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
