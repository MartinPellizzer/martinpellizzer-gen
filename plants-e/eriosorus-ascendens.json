    "intro": "Eriosorus ascendens, commonly known as the ascending fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, carpet-like growth on the forest floor. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as undergrowth in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
