    "intro": "Epidendrum flabelliforme, commonly known as the fan-leaf orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves that form a fan-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum flabelliforme is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
