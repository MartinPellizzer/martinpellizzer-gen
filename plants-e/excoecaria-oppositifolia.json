It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which are typically elliptical and dark green. The plant has a thick, corky bark that helps it withstand saltwater and tidal conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by reddish, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
