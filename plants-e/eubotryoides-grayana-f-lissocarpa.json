It is characterized by its smooth, elongated fruits that contrast with the typical rougher texture of the species. The plant belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and other ericaceous plants. It is native to regions of East Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in forested areas. Its unique fruit morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and plant taxonomy."
