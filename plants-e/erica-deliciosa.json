    "intro": "Erica deliciosa, commonly known as the sweet heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing an attractive evergreen structure. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica deliciosa is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
