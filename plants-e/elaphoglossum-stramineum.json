    "intro": "Elaphoglossum stramineum, commonly known as the yellow holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a yellowish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Elaphoglossum stramineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
