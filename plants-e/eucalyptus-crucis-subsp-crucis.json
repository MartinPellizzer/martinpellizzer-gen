    "intro": "Eucalyptus crucis subsp. crucis, commonly known as the cross-leaved mallee, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, crossed or intersecting leaf veins, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, fibrous texture. It produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, which are usually visited by nectar-feeding insects. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils."
