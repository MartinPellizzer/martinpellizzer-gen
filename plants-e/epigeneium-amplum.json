    "intro": "Epigeneium amplum, commonly known as the broadleaf epigeneium, is a tropical climbing plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
