    "intro": "Eschweilera ciroana, commonly known as the Ciroana wax palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the humid lowland forests of northern South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Eschweilera ciroana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
