    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. arcuatum, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. This variant is often found in moist soils and is an indicator species for wetland habitats."
