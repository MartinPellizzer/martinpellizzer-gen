    "intro": "Errazurizia glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular erazurizia, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in shrublands and coastal areas. Its glandular structures on the stems and leaves may play a role in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores."
