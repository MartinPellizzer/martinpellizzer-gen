    "intro": "Eroteum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant's leaves are often floating, supported by long, spongy petioles that help buoyancy. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom at night and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators such as moths. Eroteum macrophyllum plays an important ecological role by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
