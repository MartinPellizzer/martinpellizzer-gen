    "intro": "Echites hirtellus, commonly known as the rough echites, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Echites hirtellus is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in beach environments."
