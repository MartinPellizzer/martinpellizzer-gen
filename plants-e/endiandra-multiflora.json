    "intro": "Endiandra multiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has elliptical leaves with a smooth texture and is often found in lowland rainforests. It plays a significant role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
