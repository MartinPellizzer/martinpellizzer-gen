    "intro": "Epilobium glandulosum var. kurilense, commonly known as Kuril willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Kuril Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are covered in glandular hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones and along rocky shores. Its botanical features make it an important component of the coastal flora in its native habitat."
