    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum var. riparium, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the water's edge. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
