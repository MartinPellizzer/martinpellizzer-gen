    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 fallacinum, commonly known as the common willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Epilobium \u00d7 fallacinum is also known for its ability to colonize areas quickly, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed."
