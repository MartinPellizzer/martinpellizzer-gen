    "intro": "Epidendrum \u00d7 helleri, commonly known as the Orchid Hybrid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Epidendrum secundum and Epidendrum ibaguense. It is a sympodial orchid with a compact growth habit and produces multiple pseudobulbs covered in dark green, leathery leaves. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Venezuela, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. It blooms with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often appearing in clusters along the stems. Epidendrum \u00d7 helleri is popular among orchid growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
