It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to dry, sunny environments. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It is often found in dry forests and scrublands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
