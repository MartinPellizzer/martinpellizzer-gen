It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture.
