    "intro": "Eriogonum subumbellatum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum subumbellatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
