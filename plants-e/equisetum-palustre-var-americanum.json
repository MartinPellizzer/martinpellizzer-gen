    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. americanum, commonly known as the American marsh horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are released during the late spring and early summer. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
