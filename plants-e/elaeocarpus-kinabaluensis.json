    "intro": "Elaeocarpus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu elaeocarp, is a rare tree species native to the high elevations of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive floral structures. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are typically globose or ellipsoid, with a leathery pericarp that encloses a single seed. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
