    "intro": "Eucalyptus albens var. elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a variant of the white mallee eucalyptus. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its bark is often flaky or peeling, and it is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and is commonly found in mallee woodlands."
