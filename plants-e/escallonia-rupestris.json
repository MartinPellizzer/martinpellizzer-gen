    "intro": "Escallonia rupestris, commonly known as the rock escallonia, is a flowering shrub native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Escallonia rupestris is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
