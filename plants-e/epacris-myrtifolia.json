    "intro": "Epacris myrtifolia, commonly known as the honey mint or the red-stemmed epacris, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the heather family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. Epacris myrtifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and nectar-rich flowers."
