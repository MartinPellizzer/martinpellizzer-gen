It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are often more showy than the actual small white flowers. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers that are typically visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a glossy texture that enhances its ornamental appeal. Echinonyctanthus pictus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant display in gardens and greenhouses."
