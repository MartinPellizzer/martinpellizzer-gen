    "intro": "Euphrasia pseudopumila, commonly known as the dwarf eyebright, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers with prominent, showy petals that resemble eyes, a characteristic feature of the genus Euphrasia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Euphrasia pseudopumila is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
