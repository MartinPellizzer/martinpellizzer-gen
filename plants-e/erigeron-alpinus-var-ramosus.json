    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus var. ramosus, commonly known as alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, dry environments. It features a compact, low-growing structure with hairy stems and blue to purple ray florets. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment."
