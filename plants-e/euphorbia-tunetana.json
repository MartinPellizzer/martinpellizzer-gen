    "intro": "Euphorbia tunetana, commonly known as the Tunisian spurge, is a succulent plant native to North Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
