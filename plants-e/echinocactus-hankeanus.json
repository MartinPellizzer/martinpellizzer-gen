    "intro": "Echinocactus hankeanus, commonly known as the Mexican lion's mouth, is a species of cactus native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, segmented appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens."
