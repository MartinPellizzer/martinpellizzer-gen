    "intro": "Exorrhiza, commonly known as the root-like structures in certain lichens, are specialized hyphal structures that anchor the lichen to the substrate. These structures are not true roots but are composed of fungal hyphae that form a network for nutrient absorption. Exorrhiza play a crucial role in the lichen's ability to absorb water and minerals from the environment. They are often found on rocks, trees, or soil surfaces, depending on the lichen's habitat. The presence and development of exorrhiza can vary based on environmental conditions and the specific lichen species."
