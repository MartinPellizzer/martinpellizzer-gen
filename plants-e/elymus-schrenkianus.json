    "intro": "Elymus schrenkianus, commonly known as Schrenk's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 3 to 5 centimeters long, with narrow, linear leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter wide. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Elymus schrenkianus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
