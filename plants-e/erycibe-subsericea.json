    "intro": "Erycibe subsericea, commonly known as the waxy apple, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, green, round fruits that turn yellow when ripe. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and are borne in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value."
