    "intro": "Erica follicularis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Erica follicularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
