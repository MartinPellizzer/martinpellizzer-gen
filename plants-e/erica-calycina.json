It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica calycina thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
