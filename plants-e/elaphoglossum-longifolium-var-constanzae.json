    "intro": "Elaphoglossum longifolium var. constanzae, commonly known as the Constantza's holly fern, is a rare variant of the long-leaf holly fern. It is a small, delicate fern with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. Native to specific regions in South America, this variant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. The plant's unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
