    "intro": "Erophila majuscula, commonly known as the broadleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are usually broad and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Erophila majuscula is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments."
