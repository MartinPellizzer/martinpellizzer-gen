    "intro": "Erythranthe serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine rockscorpion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcium-rich soils, often found on serpentine rock outcrops. It produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are typically narrow and hairy. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
