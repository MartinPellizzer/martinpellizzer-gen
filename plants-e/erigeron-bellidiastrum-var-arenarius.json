    "intro": "Erigeron bellidiastrum var. arenarius, commonly known as the sand erigeron, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are generally narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
