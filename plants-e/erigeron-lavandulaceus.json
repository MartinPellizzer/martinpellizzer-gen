It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its blue to violet flower heads are often arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature."
