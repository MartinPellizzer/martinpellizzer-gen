It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are covered in a sticky, glandular coating. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is often found in high-altitude meadows and grasslands. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its purported eye and respiratory health benefits."
