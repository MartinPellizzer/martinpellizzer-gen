    "intro": "Echinospermum barbatum subsp. aragonense, commonly known as the Aragon thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow composite flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its fruit is a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly hairy stems and shorter, more robust leaves compared to other subspecies of Echinospermum."
