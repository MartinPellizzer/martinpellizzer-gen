It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue in color. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a mottled appearance. Eucalyptus micrantha is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
