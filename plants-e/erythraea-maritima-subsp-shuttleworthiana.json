    "intro": "Erythraea maritima subsp. shuttleworthiana, commonly known as the shuttleworth's sea holly, is a rare coastal plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and spiny, woolly leaves adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments, often growing in areas exposed to strong winds and salt spray. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
