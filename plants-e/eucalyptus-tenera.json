    "intro": "Eucalyptus tenera, commonly known as the slender gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, felt-like hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its aromatic oils, derived from the leaves, have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Eucalyptus tenera is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
