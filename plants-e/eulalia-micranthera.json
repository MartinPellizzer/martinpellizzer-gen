    "intro": "Eulalia micranthera, commonly known as the small-thorned grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshy areas of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale green flowers, which are clustered in dense, compact spikes. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Eulalia micranthera is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
