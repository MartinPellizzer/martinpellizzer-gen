    "intro": "Euphorbia trachyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with a rough, textured surface, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, which is a common trait among many species in the Euphorbia genus. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Euphorbia trachyphylla thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
