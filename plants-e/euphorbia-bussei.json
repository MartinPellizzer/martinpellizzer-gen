    "intro": "Euphorbia bussei, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, thick, woody stem with numerous branching stems that grow close to the ground. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia bussei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
