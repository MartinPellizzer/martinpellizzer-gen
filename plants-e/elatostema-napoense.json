    "intro": "Elatostema napoense, commonly known as the Napo Elatostemum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elatostemaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in the Amazon Basin, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species within its family."
