    "intro": "Eschscholzia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf California poppy, is a small annual herb native to the western United States. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive red-orange center, typical of the Papaveraceae family. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its small size and vibrant blooms, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
