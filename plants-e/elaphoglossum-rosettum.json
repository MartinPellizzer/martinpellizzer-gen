    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rosettum, commonly known as the rosette holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of fronds, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a finely divided structure, typical of many ferns in its family. Elaphoglossum rosettum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
