    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive yellowish-green sap, which is toxic to both humans and animals. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
