    "intro": "Eupatorium squarrosoramosum f. umbrosum, commonly known as the shadowy eupatorium, is a rare and distinctive variant of the eupatorium genus. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety foliage and clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland understories, where it thrives in low-light conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. The species is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
