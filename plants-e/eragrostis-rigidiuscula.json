    "intro": "Eragrostis rigidiuscula, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
