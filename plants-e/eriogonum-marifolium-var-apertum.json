    "intro": "Eriogonum marifolium var. apertum, commonly known as the openleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
