    "intro": "Erythrina cobanensis, commonly known as the Cob\u00e1n coral tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in dense, umbrella-like clusters, making it a visually striking ornamental plant. The plant has compound leaves composed of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, which are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in well-drained soils make it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates. Erythrina cobanensis is also notable for its role in supporting local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
