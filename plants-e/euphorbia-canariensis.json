    "intro": "Euphorbia canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to rocky and coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
