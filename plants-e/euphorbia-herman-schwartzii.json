    "intro": "Euphorbia herman-schwartzii, commonly known as the Hermann-Schwartz euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. However, it contains toxic sap, so care should be taken when handling it."
