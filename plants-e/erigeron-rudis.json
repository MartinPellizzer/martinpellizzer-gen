    "intro": "Erigeron rudis, commonly known as the coastal blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erigeron rudis is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
