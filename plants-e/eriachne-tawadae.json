It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
