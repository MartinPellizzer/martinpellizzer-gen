    "intro": "Epidendrum pustulosum, commonly known as the pustular epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, erect growth habit and dense clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in drier conditions. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Epidendrum pustulosum is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
