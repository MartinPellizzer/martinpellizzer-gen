    "intro": "Ecbolium revolutum, commonly known as the curled broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to attach to host plants via haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its parasitic nature. It is found in various regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe, typically growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
