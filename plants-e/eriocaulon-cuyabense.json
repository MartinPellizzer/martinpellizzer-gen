    "intro": "Eriocaulon cuyabense, commonly known as the Cuyabeno grass, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in the region."
