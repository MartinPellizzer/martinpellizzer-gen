    "intro": "Euphorbia cattimandoo, commonly known as the Ceylon spurge, is a succulent plant native to Sri Lanka. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia cattimandoo is also noted for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
