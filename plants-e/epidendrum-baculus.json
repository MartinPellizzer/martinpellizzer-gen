    "intro": "Epidendrum baculus, commonly known as the candlestick orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that resembles a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically dark green,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Epidendrum baculus prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
