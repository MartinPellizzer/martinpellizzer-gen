    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a sprawling habit, often forming dense mats on rocky soils. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are ribbed and can store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. This subspecies is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
