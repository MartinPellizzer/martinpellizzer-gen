    "intro": "Eritrichium fetisowii var. minor, commonly known as the lesser fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
