    "intro": "Eucalyptus rosacea, commonly known as the red-gum or narrow-leafed gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and smooth, fissured bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a bluish-green hue and a prominent midrib. This tree produces small, spherical white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus rosacea is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
