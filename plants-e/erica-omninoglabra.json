    "intro": "Erica omninoglabra, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a dwarf shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Erica omninoglabra is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
