    "intro": "Erophila tenerrima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eragrostis, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Erophila tenerrima is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
