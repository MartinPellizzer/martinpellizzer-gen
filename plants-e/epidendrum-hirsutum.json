    "intro": "Epidendrum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent lip petals. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Epidendrum hirsutum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
