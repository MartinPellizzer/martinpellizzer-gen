It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has spiny areoles and produces small, round fruits that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
