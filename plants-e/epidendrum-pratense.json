    "intro": "Epidendrum pratense, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Americas. It typically grows in dense clusters, with tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it thrives in humid, shady environments. Epidendrum pratense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained conditions."
