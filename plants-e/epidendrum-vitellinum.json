It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
