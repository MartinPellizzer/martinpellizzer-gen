    "intro": "Eragrostis rigidior, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
