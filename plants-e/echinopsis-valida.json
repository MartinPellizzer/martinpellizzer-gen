    "intro": "Echinopsis valida, commonly known as the white echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its globular shape and white, spiny stems that are covered in areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often nocturnal in bloom. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Echinopsis valida is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
