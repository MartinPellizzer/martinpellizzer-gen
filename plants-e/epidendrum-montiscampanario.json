    "intro": "Epidendrum montiscampanario, commonly known as the Monticello Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. The plant typically thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Epidendrum montiscampanario is also noted for its ability to bloom multiple times throughout the year under optimal conditions."
