    "intro": "Eleocharis lereschii subsp. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
