    "intro": "Eriochloa debilis, commonly known as slender false brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, often hairless stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Eriochloa debilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
