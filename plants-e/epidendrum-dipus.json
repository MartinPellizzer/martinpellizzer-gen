    "intro": "Epidendrum dipus, commonly known as the purple-flowered epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically features strap-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum dipus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
