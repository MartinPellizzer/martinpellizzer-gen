    "intro": "Euphorbia mira, commonly known as the Mirabilis Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in soft, greenish-gray foliage. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
