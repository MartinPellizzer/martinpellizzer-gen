    "intro": "Eupatorium pycnocephalum var. caucanum, commonly known as the Andean eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and is often found in moist, mountainous habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its alpine environment, including compact growth and drought-resistant features."
