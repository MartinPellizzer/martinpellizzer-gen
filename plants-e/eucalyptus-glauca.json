    "intro": "Eucalyptus glauca, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps distinguish it from other eucalyptus species. It produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
