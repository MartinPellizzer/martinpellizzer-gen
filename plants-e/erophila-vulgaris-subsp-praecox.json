It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking purple flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing small, clustered flowers that attract various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
