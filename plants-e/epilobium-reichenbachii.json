It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows along stream banks and moist woodlands. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and produces clusters of showy pink to purple flowers in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed soils. Epilobium reichenbachii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
