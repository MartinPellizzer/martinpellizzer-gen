    "intro": "Eugenia alpina, commonly known as the alpine guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries in the summer. Its leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, providing dense foliage that offers habitat for various wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and unique habitat requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
