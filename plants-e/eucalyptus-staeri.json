    "intro": "Eucalyptus staeri, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or cream flowers, which appear during the winter months. Eucalyptus staeri is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in shrublands and woodland habitats. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment."
