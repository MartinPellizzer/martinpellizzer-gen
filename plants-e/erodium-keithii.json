    "intro": "Erodium keithii, commonly known as the coastal bird's-beak, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a slender, curved pod that splits open to release tiny seeds. Erodium keithii is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in its habitat."
