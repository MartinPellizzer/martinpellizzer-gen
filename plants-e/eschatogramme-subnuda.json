    "intro": "Eschatogramme subnuda, commonly known as the naked eschatogram, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
