    "intro": "Encephalartos longifolius var. revolutus, commonly known as the Revolute Cycad, is a rare and distinctive cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, twisted leaf margins that give it its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem with a fibrous, spongy trunk that can grow up to several meters in height. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow leaflets that are often a deep green color. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is typically propagated through seed or by dividing the rhizomes."
