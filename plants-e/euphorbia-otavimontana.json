    "intro": "Euphorbia otavimontana, commonly known as the Otavi mountain spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
