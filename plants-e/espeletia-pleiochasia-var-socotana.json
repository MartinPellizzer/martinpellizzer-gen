    "intro": "Espeletia pleiochasia var. socotana, commonly known as the Socotra candelabra, is a unique plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and a crown of long, narrow leaves. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, providing insulation and reducing water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. This plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat."
