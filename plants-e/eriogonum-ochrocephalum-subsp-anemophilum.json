    "intro": "Eriogonum ochrocephalum subsp. anemophilum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are adapted for wind pollination, a key feature of its subspecies. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
