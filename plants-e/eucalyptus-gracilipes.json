    "intro": "Eucalyptus gracilipes, commonly known as the slender ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and white. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat."
