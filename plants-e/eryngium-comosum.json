    "intro": "Eryngium comosum, commonly known as the blue thistle or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistles, surrounded by bracts. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with silvery-gray foliage that is covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Eryngium comosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
