    "intro": "Eriocactus ampliocostatus, commonly known as the broad-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant features wide, flat ribs that are often adorned with clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The cactus is relatively low-maintenance, requiring minimal water once established."
