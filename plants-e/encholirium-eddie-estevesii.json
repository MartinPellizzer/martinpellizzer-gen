    "intro": "Encholirium eddie-estevesii, commonly known as the Eddie-Esteves' lily, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, tall flowering stalk. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
