    "intro": "Euphorbia sareptana, commonly known as the Armenian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive, often lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
