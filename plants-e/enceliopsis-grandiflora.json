    "intro": "Enceliopsis grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower bristlecone, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Enceliopsis grandiflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates."
