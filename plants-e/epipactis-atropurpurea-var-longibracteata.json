    "intro": "Epipactis atropurpurea var. longibracteata, commonly known as the purple helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish flowers and elongated bracts that give it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while the flowers are spurred and showy, attracting specific pollinators. This orchid is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a high degree of morphological variation within its species."
