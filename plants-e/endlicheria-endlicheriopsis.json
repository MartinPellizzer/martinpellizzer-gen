    "intro": "Endlicheria endlicheriopsis, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange-colored flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Endlicheria endlicheriopsis is considered a species of conservation concern."
