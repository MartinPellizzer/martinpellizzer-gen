    "intro": "Euonymus alatus var. verus, commonly known as the winged euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive winged stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. This variety is closely related to the common euonymus but exhibits more pronounced winging on its stems."
