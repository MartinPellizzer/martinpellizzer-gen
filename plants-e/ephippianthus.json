    "intro": "Ephippianthus, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native environment. Ephippianthus species produce small, tubular flowers in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. These plants are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
