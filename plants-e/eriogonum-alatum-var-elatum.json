    "intro": "Eriogonum alatum var. elatum, commonly known as the tall leaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
