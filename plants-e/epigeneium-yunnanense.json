    "intro": "Epigeneium yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan epigeneium, is a rare and endangered species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a herbaceous plant with a short, erect stem and broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often growing in the understorey of tropical and subtropical forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
