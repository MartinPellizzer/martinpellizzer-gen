    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium var. megastachyon, commonly known as narrow-leaved cotton grass, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, cottony flower heads that are white or pale pink. This variant is typically found in wet or moist habitats such as bogs, marshes, and tundra regions. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in spikes, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environments."
