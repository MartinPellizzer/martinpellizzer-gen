    "intro": "Eleocharis triangulata, commonly known as the triangular spike-rush, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are often cylindrical and slightly triangular in cross-section, giving it its common name. Eleocharis triangulata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
