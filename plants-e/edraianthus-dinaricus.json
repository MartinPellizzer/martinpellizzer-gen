    "intro": "Edraianthus dinaricus, commonly known as the Dinaric edraianthus, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale blue flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
