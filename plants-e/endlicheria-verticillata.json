It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy to the touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically spans from late spring to early autumn."
