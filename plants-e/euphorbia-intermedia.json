    "intro": "Euphorbia intermedia, commonly known as the coastal euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences, and is often mistaken for a flower. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Euphorbia intermedia is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
