    "intro": "Euphorbia sarcostemmoides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced or absent, with the stems serving as the primary photosynthetic structures. It thrives in arid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops."
