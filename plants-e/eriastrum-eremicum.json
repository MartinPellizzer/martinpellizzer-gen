    "intro": "Eriastrum eremicum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual plant with hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its dry environment. Its seed heads are similar to those of a dandelion, with tiny seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Eriastrum eremicum is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
