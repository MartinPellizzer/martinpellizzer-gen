    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum subsp. sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern regions of Asia. It features small, dark blue to black berries that are typically covered in a whitish powder, known as a bloom. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in tundra and boreal forest regions, playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife."
