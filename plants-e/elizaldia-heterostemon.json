    "intro": "Elizaldia heterostemon, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Elizaldia heterostemon is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
