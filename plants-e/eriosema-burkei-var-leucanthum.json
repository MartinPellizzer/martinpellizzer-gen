    "intro": "Eriosema burkei var. leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered eriosema, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous, and it prefers well-drained, sandy soils in full sun. This variant is distinguished by its pale floral coloration, setting it apart from other varieties within the Eriosema genus."
