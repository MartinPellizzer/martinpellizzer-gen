    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus multicostatus f. erectocentrus, commonly known as the upright-ribbed cactus, is a distinctive member of the Cactaceae family characterized by its tall, columnar stems. It features prominent, rib-like structures that give it a unique, spiny appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. Native to specific regions of Mexico, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized collections and requires careful care to ensure its survival."
