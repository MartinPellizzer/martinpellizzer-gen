It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms, attracting specific insect pollinators."
