    "intro": "Eutrema arenicola, commonly known as the sandflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern Pacific Ocean. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy and saline soils, often found in dunes and coastal bluffs. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small yellow flowers are typical of its coastal habitat. Eutrema arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
