    "intro": "Eulophia warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves and bears clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments it typically inhabits. Eulophia warburgii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
