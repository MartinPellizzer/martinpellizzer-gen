    "intro": "Elaphoglossum clathratum, commonly known as the lattice fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive, lattice-like pattern on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum clathratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
