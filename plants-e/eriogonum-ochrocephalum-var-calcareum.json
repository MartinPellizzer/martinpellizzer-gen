    "intro": "Eriogonum ochrocephalum var. calcareum, commonly known as the limestone flaxflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium carbonate, which is why it is often found in limestone areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
