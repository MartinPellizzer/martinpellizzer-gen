    "intro": "Epidendrum nubigena, commonly known as the cloud orchid, is a species of orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted to capture rainwater efficiently. Epidendrum nubigena thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
