    "intro": "Eragrostis purshii var. major, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which make it visually distinctive. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Blue grama plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
