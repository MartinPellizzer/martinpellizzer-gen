    "intro": "Euphorbia sibirica, commonly known as Siberian spurge, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environments, with succulent tissues that store water and reduce transpiration. Euphorbia sibirica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in cold climates."
