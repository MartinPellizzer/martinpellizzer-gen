    "intro": "Epidendrum opiranthizon, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The species is valued in horticulture for its vibrant floral display and relatively easy care requirements."
