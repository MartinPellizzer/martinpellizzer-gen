    "intro": "Epidendrum variegatum var. crassilabium, commonly known as the broad-lipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, yellow, and green, with a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
