    "intro": "Eriocoma floribunda, commonly known as the flowering eriocoma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Eriocoma floribunda is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research."
