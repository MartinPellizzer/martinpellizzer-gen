    "intro": "Elaphoglossum schiedei, commonly known as the Schied's holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that often form a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the genus Elaphoglossum. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
