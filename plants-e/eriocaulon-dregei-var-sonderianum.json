    "intro": "Eriocaulon dregei var. sonderianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in its natural environment. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
