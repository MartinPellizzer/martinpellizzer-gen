It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular (four-sided) stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
