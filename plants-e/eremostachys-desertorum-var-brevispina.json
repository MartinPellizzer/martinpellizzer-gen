    "intro": "Eremostachys desertorum var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined desert eryngo, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and gray-green foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its short, spiny stems and leaves are adaptations to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. This species is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of desert flora in its native range."
