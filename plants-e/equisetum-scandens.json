    "intro": "Equisetum scandens, commonly known as the climbing horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, whorled structures called enations, which are not true leaves. Equisetum scandens thrives in moist, often shaded environments and is often found along stream banks or in wet meadows."
