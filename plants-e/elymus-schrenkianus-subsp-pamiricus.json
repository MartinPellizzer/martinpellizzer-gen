    "intro": "Elymus schrenkianus subsp. pamiricus, commonly known as the Pamir needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, needle-like leaves adapted to cold and arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky and mountainous terrain, often found in alpine meadows and steppe zones. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
