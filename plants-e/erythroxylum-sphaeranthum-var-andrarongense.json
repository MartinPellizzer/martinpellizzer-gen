    "intro": "Erythroxylum sphaeranthum var. andrarongense, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a species native to the high Andes of South America. It is a flowering plant characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments and is well adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive elliptical shape, while its stems are woody and often branched. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
