    "intro": "Encyclia uxpanapensis, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Encyclia uxpanapensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
