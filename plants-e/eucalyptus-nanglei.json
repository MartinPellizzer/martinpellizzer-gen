    "intro": "Eucalyptus nanglei, commonly known as the Nangle's gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. It produces small, spherical white flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native region."
