    "intro": "Erigeron stanfordii, commonly known as Stanford's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are generally hairy and gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
