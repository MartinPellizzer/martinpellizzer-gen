    "intro": "Elaphandra sucrensis, commonly known as the Sucrensis Mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in regions of Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
