    "intro": "Euphorbia purisimana, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia purisimana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
