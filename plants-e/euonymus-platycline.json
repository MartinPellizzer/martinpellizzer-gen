    "intro": "Euonymus platycline, commonly known as the flatleaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. Its stems are often covered in small, white, waxy dots, which are characteristic of the Euonymus genus. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
