    "intro": "Epipactis turcomanica, commonly known as the Turkestan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Central Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, fleshy rhizome and erect, hairy stems. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow lip and a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
