    "intro": "Ephedra stenosperma, commonly known as jointfoot ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its green, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and later develops small, woody capsules containing seeds. Ephedra stenosperma is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments due to its efficient water conservation mechanisms. It is also of interest in botanical studies for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
