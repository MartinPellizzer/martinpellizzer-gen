    "intro": "Eckartia, commonly known as the African orchid or orchid tree, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its showy, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves and a woody stem. Eckartia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blossoms. However, they are not commonly found in commercial horticulture due to their specific environmental requirements."
