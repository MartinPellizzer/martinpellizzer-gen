    "intro": "Evolvulus arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Evolvulus arenicola is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an important species for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
