    "intro": "Euryloma aristata, commonly known as the tall bristlebush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. Euryloma aristata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh desert conditions."
