    "intro": "Excavatia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal excavator, is a rare and specialized plant found in coastal areas with high salinity and sandy soils. It possesses a unique root system adapted to stabilize itself in shifting sand and withstand tidal forces. The plant's leaves are small, waxy, and succulent, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces tiny, pale flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
