    "intro": "Eriocaulon piliferum, commonly known as the hairy ricegrass, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with short, fibrous roots and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in wet, marshy habitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Eriocaulon piliferum is notable for its hairy texture on the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name."
