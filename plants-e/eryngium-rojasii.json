    "intro": "Eryngium rojasii, commonly known as the Rojas' thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and purple-blue flower heads. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, with a deep root system that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eryngium rojasii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
