    "intro": "Erica cinerea var. pallida, commonly known as the pale heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, hardy groundcover."
