    "intro": "Eriogonum lobbii var. robustum, commonly known as the robust mountain buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
