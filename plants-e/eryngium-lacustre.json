    "intro": "Eryngium lacustre, commonly known as lake thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, spiny stems and bright blue to purple ray flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has basal rosettes of gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture. Its unique appearance makes it a striking addition to moist garden soils and wetland restoration projects. Eryngium lacustre plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
