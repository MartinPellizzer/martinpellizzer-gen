    "intro": "Eugenia pisonis, commonly known as the Java apple or wild guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically edible, though they are not as widely consumed as cultivated guavas. Eugenia pisonis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in tropical botany."
