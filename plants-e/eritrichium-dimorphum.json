    "intro": "Eritrichium dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form hoary vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a distinctive two-form structure, with some leaves being simple and others compound. Eritrichium dimorphum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
