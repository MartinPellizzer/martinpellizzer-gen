    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pusillum, commonly known as the small fern or narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rock crevices. Elaphoglossum pusillum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
