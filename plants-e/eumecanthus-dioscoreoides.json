    "intro": "Eumecanthus dioscoreoides, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Iridaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are composed of three petals and three sepals, with a distinctive yellow coloration that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eumecanthus dioscoreoides plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems."
