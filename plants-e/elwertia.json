    "intro": "Elwertia, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. Elwertia species are typically small shrubs or herbs with succulent leaves adapted to drought conditions. They produce clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
