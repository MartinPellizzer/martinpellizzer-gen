    "intro": "Eustrephus amplexifolius, commonly known as the clasping-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy, and often reddish leaves that tightly clasp the stem. The plant produces tall, erect stems bearing showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its flowers are tubular at the base and gradually widen into a bell shape, with five lobes at the mouth. Eustrephus amplexifolius thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
