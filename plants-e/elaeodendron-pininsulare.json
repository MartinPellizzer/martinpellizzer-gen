It is a shrub or small tree with distinctive, star-shaped leaves that resemble the arms of a starfish, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat.
