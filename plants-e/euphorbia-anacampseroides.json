    "intro": "Euphorbia anacampseroides, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with gray-green, fleshy leaves that are covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
