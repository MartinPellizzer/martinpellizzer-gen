    "intro": "Elaphoglossum mettenii, commonly known as the Maori maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. This rare and endangered species is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance."
