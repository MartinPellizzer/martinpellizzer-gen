It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the seasonal dry and wet periods of its native habitat. Eugenia cerrocacaoensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
