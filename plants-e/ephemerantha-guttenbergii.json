    "intro": "Ephemerantha guttenbergii, commonly known as the Guttenberg's ephemeral, is a rare flowering plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, short-lived flowers that bloom briefly in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and prairies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
