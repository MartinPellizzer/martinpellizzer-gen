    "intro": "Euphorbia gerardiana var. minor, commonly known as the lesser Gerard's spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the spurge family. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is native to parts of southern Europe and North Africa. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in xerophytic gardens."
