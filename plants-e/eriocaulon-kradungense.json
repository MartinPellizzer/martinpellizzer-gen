    "intro": "Eriocaulon kradungense, commonly known as the Kradung sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It is often found in wetlands, along streams, and in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
