    "intro": "Echinopsis rhodotricha var. chacoana, commonly known as the Chacoan night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to northern Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are covered in white, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
