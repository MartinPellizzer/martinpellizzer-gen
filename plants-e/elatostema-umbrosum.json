    "intro": "Elatostema umbrosum, commonly known as the shadowy elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as understorey forests. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Elatostema umbrosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
