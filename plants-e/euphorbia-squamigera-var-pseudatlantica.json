    "intro": "Euphorbia squamigera var. pseudatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a branching stem covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
