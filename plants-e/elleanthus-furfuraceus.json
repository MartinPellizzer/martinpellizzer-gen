    "intro": "Elleanthus furfuraceus, commonly known as the rough hairveld grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in grassland habitats and is adapted to dry, sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Elleanthus furfuraceus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native range."
