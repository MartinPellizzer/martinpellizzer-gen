    "intro": "Epidendrum trachythece, commonly known as the waxy lip orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features striking, waxy flowers with a prominent lip that is often a different color from the rest of the flower. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, and it produces numerous small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Epidendrum trachythece is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
