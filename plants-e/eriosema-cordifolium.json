It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, often with a reddish tinge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
