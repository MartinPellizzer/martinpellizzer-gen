    "intro": "Eragrostis incana, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eragrostis incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
