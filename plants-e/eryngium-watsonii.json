It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Eryngium watsonii typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It serves as a food source for certain insects and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
