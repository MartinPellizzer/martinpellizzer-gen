It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
