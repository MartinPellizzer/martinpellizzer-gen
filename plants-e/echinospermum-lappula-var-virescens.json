    "intro": "Echinospermum lappula var. virescens, commonly known as the green bladderwrack, is a variant of the bladderwrack species native to coastal regions. It is a marine angiosperm that thrives in intertidal zones, characterized by its dark green, fleshy, and bladder-like structures. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with a central axis and numerous air bladders that aid in buoyancy. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers and capsule-like fruits that release spores. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for marine organisms."
