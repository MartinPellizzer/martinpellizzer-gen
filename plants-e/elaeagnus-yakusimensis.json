It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, reddish berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Elaeagnus yakusimensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
