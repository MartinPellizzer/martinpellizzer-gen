    "intro": "Enourea, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a rosette of dark green, velvety leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Enourea is relatively hardy, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its unique blooming cycle and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
