    "intro": "Ephemerum nummularia, commonly known as silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
