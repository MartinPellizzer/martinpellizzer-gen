    "intro": "Ebenus armitagei, commonly known as the Armitage's euphorbia, is a rare and unusual plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Ebenus armitagei is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
