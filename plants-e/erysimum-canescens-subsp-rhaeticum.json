    "intro": "Erysimum canescens subsp. rhaeticum, commonly known as the Alpine wallflower, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features erect, hairy stems and basal leaves that are often grayish due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are grouped in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
