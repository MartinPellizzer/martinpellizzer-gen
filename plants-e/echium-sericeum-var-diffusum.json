    "intro": "Echium sericeum var. diffusum, commonly known as the silverweed or velvetflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
