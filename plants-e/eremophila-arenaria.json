    "intro": "Eremophila arenaria, commonly known as the sandplain emu bush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its leaves are usually narrow and grey-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Eremophila arenaria is well-suited to low-water conditions and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
