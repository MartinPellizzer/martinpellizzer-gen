    "intro": "Elatostema nanchuanense var. calciferum, commonly known as the limestone Elatostema, is a rare plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils, preferring shaded and moist environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
