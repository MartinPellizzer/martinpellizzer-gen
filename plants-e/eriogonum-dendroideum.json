    "intro": "Eriogonum dendroideum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Eriogonum dendroideum is well adapted to harsh environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
