    "intro": "Eucalyptus jucunda, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a slight waxy coating. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. This species is adapted to dry, inland environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
