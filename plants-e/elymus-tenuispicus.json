    "intro": "Elymus tenuispicus, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, and the inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike. Elymus tenuispicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
