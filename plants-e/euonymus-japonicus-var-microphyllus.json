    "intro": "Euonymus japonicus var. microphyllus, commonly known as Japanese spurge or dwarf euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red-orange berries that are attractive to birds. It is widely cultivated as a ground cover or ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Its foliage remains vibrant throughout the year, making it suitable for use in shaded garden areas."
