    "intro": "Elatostema reticulatovenosum, commonly known as the net-veined elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves with a finely reticulate venation pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Elatostema reticulatovenosum is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
