    "intro": "Erythrina falcata, commonly known as the red torch tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its bark is often fissured and rough in appearance. Erythrina falcata produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
