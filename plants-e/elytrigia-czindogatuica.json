    "intro": "Elytrigia czindogatuica, commonly known as the Czindogatu's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with florets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
