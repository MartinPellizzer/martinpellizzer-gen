    "intro": "Epidendrum centronum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a fine, silky texture. Epidendrum centronum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
