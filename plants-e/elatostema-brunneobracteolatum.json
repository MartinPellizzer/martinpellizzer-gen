    "intro": "Elatostema brunneobracteolatum, commonly known as the brown bract elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically flowering during the wet season. Its leaves are often covered in fine trichomes, which may aid in water retention and protection from herbivores. Elatostema brunneobracteolatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
