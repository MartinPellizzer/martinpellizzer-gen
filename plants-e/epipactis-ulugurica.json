    "intro": "Epipactis ulugurica, commonly known as the Uluguru orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Uluguru Mountains of Tanzania. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a few lanceolate leaves. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with numerous small, greenish-yellow flowers that have a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
