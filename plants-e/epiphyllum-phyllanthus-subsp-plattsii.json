    "intro": "Epiphyllum phyllanthus subsp. plattsii, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented stems that resemble leaves, which are actually modified stems used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the winter months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This epiphytic plant is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental flowers and unique appearance."
