    "intro": "Eriodendron aesculifolium, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which resemble those of the horse chestnut, and its showy white flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces fruiting bodies called burr fruits, which contain spiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
