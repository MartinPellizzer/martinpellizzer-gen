    "intro": "Eleocharis fennica var. fennica, commonly known as the Fennoscandian spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clusters at the base of the plant. This variety is characterized by its ability to tolerate nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of the vegetation in its native wetland ecosystems."
