    "intro": "Eleocharis occulta, commonly known as the hidden sedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist environment. Eleocharis occulta plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
