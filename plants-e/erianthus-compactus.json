    "intro": "Erianthus compactus, commonly known as dwarf sugar cane, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, making it suitable for ornamental use. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often overlooked due to its grass-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Despite its modest size, Erianthus compactus is valued for its resilience and low maintenance requirements."
