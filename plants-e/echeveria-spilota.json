It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces showy blue-pink flowers during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
