    "intro": "Euphorbia maleolens, commonly known as the red-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
