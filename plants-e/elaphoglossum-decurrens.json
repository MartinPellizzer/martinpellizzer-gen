    "intro": "Elaphoglossum decurrens, commonly known as the creeping holly fern, is a small, perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum decurrens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
