    "intro": "Elsholtzia, commonly known as Chinese pennyroyal, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. It consists of about 50 species, most of which are native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China. The plants are typically shrubs or herbs with aromatic, often hairy leaves and small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or violet in color. Elsholtzia species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to dry, sunny environments. They are valued in traditional medicine and horticulture for their ornamental value and aromatic properties."
