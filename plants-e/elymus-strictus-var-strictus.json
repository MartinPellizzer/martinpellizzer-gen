    "intro": "Elymus strictus var. strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant."
