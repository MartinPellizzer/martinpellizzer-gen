    "intro": "Eucalyptus phaenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or grey, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin layers, revealing a mottled pattern beneath. Eucalyptus phaenophylla is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
