    "intro": "Elaeagnus inermis, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Elaeagnus inermis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
