    "intro": "Echinops dichrous, commonly known as the double-headed thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small, white balls. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the distinctive seed heads that persist through the winter. Echinops dichrous thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
