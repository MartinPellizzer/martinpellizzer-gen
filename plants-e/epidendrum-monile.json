    "intro": "Epidendrum monile, commonly known as the chain orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are often fragrant and bloom in clusters, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Epidendrum monile is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular watering."
