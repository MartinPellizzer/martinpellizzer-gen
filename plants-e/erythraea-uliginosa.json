    "intro": "Erythraea uliginosa, commonly known as the bog rosemary, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in northern regions. It is characterized by its small, pink or white flowers and its ability to thrive in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has aromatic leaves and is often found in bogs and heaths. Its growth is typically low to the ground, with creeping stems that form dense mats. Erythraea uliginosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity."
