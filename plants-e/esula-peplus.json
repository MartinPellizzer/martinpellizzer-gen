    "intro": "Esula peplus, commonly known as the common sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by oval, fleshy fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in dry conditions. Esula peplus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in disturbed or marginal habitats."
