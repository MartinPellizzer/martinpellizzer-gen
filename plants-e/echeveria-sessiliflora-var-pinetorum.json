    "intro": "Echeveria sessiliflora var. pinetorum, commonly known as the Pineapple Echeveria, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and striking foliage make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
