    "intro": "Euphorbia cupularis, commonly known as the cupular euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
