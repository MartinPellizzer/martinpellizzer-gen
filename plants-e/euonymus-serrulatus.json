    "intro": "Euonymus serrulatus, commonly known as the serrulate woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with finely serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its adaptability and attractive fall foliage contribute to its horticultural value."
