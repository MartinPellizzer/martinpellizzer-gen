It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, grayish-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Eritrichium canum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
