    "intro": "Eucalyptus alba, commonly known as the white gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in long strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a rough upper surface. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. This species is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
