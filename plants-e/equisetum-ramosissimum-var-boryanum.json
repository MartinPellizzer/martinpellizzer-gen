    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. boryanum, commonly known as the Boryanum horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem that is typically green or yellow-green in color. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era. This species is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological succession."
