    "intro": "Eurya japonica f. integra, commonly known as Japanese evergreen holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing year-round foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a specimen plant. Its ornamental value comes from its dense growth habit and seasonal color changes."
