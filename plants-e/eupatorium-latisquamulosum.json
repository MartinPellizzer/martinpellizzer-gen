    "intro": "Eupatorium latisquamulosum, commonly known as broad-scale eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture and are covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Eupatorium latisquamulosum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
