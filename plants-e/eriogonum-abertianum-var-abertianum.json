    "intro": "Eriogonum abertianum var. abertianum, commonly known as Abert's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, preferring well-drained soils. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces bracteate inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
