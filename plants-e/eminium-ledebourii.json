    "intro": "Eminium ledebourii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its native environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
