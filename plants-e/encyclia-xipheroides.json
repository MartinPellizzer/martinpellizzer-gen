    "intro": "Encyclia xipheroides, commonly known as the Mexican bee orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, bee-shaped flowers that are typically yellow with purple markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a fan shape. Encyclia xipheroides thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
