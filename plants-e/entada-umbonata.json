    "intro": "Entada umbonata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and compound leaves that are opposite and pinnate. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by long, slender pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also used in traditional medicine. The plant has ecological importance as a habitat provider and for its role in local ecosystems."
