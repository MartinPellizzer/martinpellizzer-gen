    "intro": "Eupatorium zinniifolium, commonly known as the golden anise or sweet everlasting, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. These flowers are arranged in panicles and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
