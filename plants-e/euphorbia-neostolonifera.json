    "intro": "Euphorbia neostolonifera, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences, and it has milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance. Its growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover in well-drained soils."
