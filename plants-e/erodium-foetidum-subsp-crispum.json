    "intro": "Erodium foetidum subsp. crispum, commonly known as stink weed or sticky weed, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pink to purple flowers and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in glandular dots. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its strong scent and sticky foliage, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
