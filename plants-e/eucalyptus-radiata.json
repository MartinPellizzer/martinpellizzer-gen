    "intro": "Eucalyptus radiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree form, with smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus radiata is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
