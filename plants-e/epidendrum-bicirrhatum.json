    "intro": "Epidendrum bicirrhatum, commonly known as the two-horned epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Epidendrum bicirrhatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
