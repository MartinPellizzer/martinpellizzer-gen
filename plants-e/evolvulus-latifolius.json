It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that open in the morning. The plant is a herbaceous annual that thrives in warm climates and well-drained soil. It produces small, round seeds enclosed in a papery capsule, which aids in its dispersal. Evolvulus latifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
