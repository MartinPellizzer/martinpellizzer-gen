    "intro": "Eulophia decurva, commonly known as the curved eulophia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Eulophia decurva is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
