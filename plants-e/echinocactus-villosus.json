    "intro": "Echinocactus villosus, commonly known as the woolly hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing cactus with a globular shape and dense, white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but bright. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
