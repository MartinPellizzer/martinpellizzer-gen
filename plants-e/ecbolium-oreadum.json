It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in acidic environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually pink or white, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Ecbolium oreadum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
