    "intro": "Eleutherococcus spinosus f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth eleutherococcus, is a variant of the eleutherococcus plant native to eastern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its sparsely branched structure and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in woodland environments and is valued for its adaptability and potential health benefits."
