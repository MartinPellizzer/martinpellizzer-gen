    "intro": "Eriogonum trichopes subsp. typicum, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its leaves are covered in a sticky substance, which helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This species plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
