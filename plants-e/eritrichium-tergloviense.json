    "intro": "Eritrichium tergloviense, commonly known as the Tergolviense alpine forget-me-not, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, and it produces small, rounded seed pods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
