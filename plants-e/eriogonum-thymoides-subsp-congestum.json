    "intro": "Eriogonum thymoides subsp. congestum, commonly known as the California buckwheat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, showy white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, chaparral, and disturbed soils. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain single seeds. The subspecies congestum is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and denser inflorescences compared to other forms of Eriogonum thymoides."
