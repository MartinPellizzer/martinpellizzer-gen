    "intro": "Erodium longirostrum, commonly known as the long-beaked bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
