    "intro": "Eriosyce ceratistes, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiny stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, and its spines provide protection from herbivores. Eriosyce ceratistes is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and resilience."
