    "intro": "Echinopsis bylesiana, commonly known as the Bylesian moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its short, globose stem and a single, spiny areole. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the night, which is a common trait among many night-blooming cacti. It is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water efficiently."
