    "intro": "Euphorbia corollata var. apocynifolia, commonly known as the pink spurge, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves known as bracts. It thrives in moist to wet soils in open woods and wetlands, and it is often found in the understory of forested areas. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems."
