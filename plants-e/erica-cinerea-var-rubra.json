    "intro": "Erica cinerea var. rubra, commonly known as the red heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance. Erica cinerea var. rubra is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in challenging conditions."
