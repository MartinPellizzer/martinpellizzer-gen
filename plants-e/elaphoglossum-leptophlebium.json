    "intro": "Elaphoglossum leptophlebium, commonly known as the slender-veined holly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum leptophlebium is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
