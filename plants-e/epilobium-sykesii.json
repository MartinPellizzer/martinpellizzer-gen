It belongs to the Onagraceae family, which includes species such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers. It thrives in moist, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Epilobium sykesii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
