    "intro": "Eurycaulis discocaulon, commonly known as the zigzag seagrass, is a marine flowering plant found in shallow coastal waters. It has a distinctive zigzag growth pattern in its leaves, which helps it withstand strong water currents. The plant produces small, white flowers that are adapted for underwater pollination. Its roots form dense mats that stabilize sediments and provide habitat for marine life. Eurycaulis discocaulon plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and maintaining water quality."
