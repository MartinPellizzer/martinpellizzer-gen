It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and clusters of small, pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, white seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
