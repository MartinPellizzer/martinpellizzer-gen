    "intro": "Elaeagnus mollis, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its distinctive, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky areas. Elaeagnus mollis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
