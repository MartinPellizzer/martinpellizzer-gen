    "intro": "Elaphoglossum delasotae, commonly known as the Delasota holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Elaphoglossum delasotae is native to parts of Central and South America, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
