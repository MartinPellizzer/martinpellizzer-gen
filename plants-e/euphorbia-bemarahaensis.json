    "intro": "Euphorbia bemarahaensis, commonly known as the Bemaraha spurge, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces a milky sap that is toxic. Euphorbia bemarahaensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native environment."
