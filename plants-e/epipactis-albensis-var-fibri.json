    "intro": "Epipactis albensis var. fibri, commonly known as the fibrous white helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy white or pale green flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. The fibrous texture of its leaves and stems is a notable botanical feature, contributing to its common name."
