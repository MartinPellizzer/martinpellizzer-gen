    "intro": "Erica coronanthera, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. Erica coronanthera is part of the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
