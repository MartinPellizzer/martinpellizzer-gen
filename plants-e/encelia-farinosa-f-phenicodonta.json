    "intro": "Encelia farinosa f. phenicodonta, commonly known as the Desert Encelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub with grey-green, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which provide additional protection against intense sunlight and drought. This variety is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and adaptability to extreme conditions."
