    "intro": "Ericoila quinquefolia, commonly known as the five-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of five. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Ericoila quinquefolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
