It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often adorned with bristly hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Eriochloa barbatus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common species in ecological studies and landscape restoration projects."
