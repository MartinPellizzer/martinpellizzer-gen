    "intro": "Eulophia versicolor, commonly known as the variable eulophia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms during the summer months and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged in two rows around the pseudobulbs. Eulophia versicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
