    "intro": "Echium glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with hairy surfaces, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are tubular and attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Echium glomeratum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
