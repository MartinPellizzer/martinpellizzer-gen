    "intro": "Eugenia insularis, commonly known as the island eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to coastal and island environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Eugenia insularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit, which is used in local cuisines."
