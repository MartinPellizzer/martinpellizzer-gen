    "intro": "Erica biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and its ability to produce two flowers per stem, hence its common name. Erica biflora typically blooms in spring, producing small, pale pink or white flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
