    "intro": "Euphorbia esculenta, commonly known as the African butterplant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures containing small yellow flowers. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Despite its potential hazards, it is cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
