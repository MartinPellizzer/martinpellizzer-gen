    "intro": "Euxolus viridis var. ascendens, commonly known as the ascending green euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in a waxy, greenish coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic adaptation to arid environments. This variant is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements in dry climates."
