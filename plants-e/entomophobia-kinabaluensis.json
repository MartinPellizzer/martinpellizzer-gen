    "intro": "Entomophobia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean tree fern, is a unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its rhizome system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in rocky or soil substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
