    "intro": "Exogonium conzattii, commonly known as the Zantia orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Exogonium conzattii is considered a conservation concern."
