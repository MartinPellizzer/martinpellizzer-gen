    "intro": "Epilobium alpinum var. sertulatum, commonly known as alpine willow herb, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high elevations. The plant features showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine habitats."
