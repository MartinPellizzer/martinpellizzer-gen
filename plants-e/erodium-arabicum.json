    "intro": "Erodium arabicum, commonly known as the Arab erodium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 20 to 40 centimeters. The plant features small, pink or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The seeds are small and produced in capsules, contributing to its ability to spread in disturbed soils."
