    "intro": "Elaeocarpus speciosus, commonly known as the velvetwood or red sanders, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark red bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its durable timber and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
