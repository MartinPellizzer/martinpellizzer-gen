    "intro": "Erodium salzmannii subsp. salzmannii, commonly known as Salzmann's bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oblong fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
