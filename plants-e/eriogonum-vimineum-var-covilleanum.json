    "intro": "Eriogonum vimineum var. covilleanum, commonly known as the Coville's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various small animals."
