    "intro": "Euphorbia leucodendron subsp. oncoclada, commonly known as the white-leaved euphorbia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, white to pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
