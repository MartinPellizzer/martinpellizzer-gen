    "intro": "Eurya japonica var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese holly, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and seasonal color changes."
