It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, rounded or elliptical flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant produces woody capsules as fruit, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. This species is often found in heathlands and woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
