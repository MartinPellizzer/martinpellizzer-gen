    "intro": "Ebermaiera axillaris, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and tonal qualities, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
