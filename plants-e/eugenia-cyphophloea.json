    "intro": "Eugenia cyphophloea, commonly known as the African blackwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Due to its dense, heavy wood, it is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments."
