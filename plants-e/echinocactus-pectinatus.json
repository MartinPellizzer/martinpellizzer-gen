    "intro": "Echinocactus pectinatus, commonly known as the Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in prominent, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with minimal water requirements, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. The plant's structure and appearance make it a popular ornamental species in succulent collections."
