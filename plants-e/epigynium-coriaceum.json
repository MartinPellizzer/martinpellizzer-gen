    "intro": "Epigynium coriaceum, commonly known as the rough epigynium, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its leathery, thick foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant's structure includes a short, woody stem with dense, clustered leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish in color, and are adapted for wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
