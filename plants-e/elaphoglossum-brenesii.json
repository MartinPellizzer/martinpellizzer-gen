    "intro": "Elaphoglossum brenesii, commonly known as the Brenes' holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum brenesii is considered a species of conservation concern."
