    "intro": "Eschweilera congestiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it grows in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces woody fruits that contain several seeds, and its bark is often used in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting for its valuable wood, it is considered an endangered species."
