    "intro": "Eschweilera manaosensis, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, red-orange flowers. The tree produces woody fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is valued for its dense, dark wood, which is used in musical instruments and furniture. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Eschweilera manaosensis is considered a vulnerable species."
