    "intro": "Erophila roseola, commonly known as the pink sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Erophila roseola is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
