    "intro": "Epidendrum carpophorum, commonly known as the orchid with the unique flower structure, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its roots while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are often pink or purple, with a distinctive, elongated shape that sets it apart from other orchid species. Epidendrum carpophorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
