    "intro": "Eulophidium sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its thick, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to surfaces. The plant's vegetative body, or thallus, is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Eulophidium sclerophyllum thrives in dry, rocky environments, often found on tree bark or soil surfaces in arid regions. Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator species for ecological studies."
