It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a distinctive, spiny structure with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
