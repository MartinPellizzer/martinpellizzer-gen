It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a green body covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and compact size make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
