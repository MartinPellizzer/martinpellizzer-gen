    "intro": "Euphorbia cordatella, commonly known as the heart-shaped spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically heart-shaped, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by colorful bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia cordatella is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
