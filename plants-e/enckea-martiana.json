    "intro": "Enckea martiana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant has simple, opposite, and ovate leaves that are usually glossy green in color. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
