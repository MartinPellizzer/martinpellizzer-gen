It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring. The plant has a dense, woolly covering that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
