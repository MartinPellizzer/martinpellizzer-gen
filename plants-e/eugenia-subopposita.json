    "intro": "Eugenia subopposita, commonly known as the red-flowered eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that are clustered in groups, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Eugenia subopposita is often found in heathlands and dry forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
