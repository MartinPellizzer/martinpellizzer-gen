    "intro": "Euphorbia ephedroides, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is known for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions. Euphorbia ephedroides is also noted for its medicinal properties, containing compounds similar to those found in ephedra."
