    "intro": "Exacum laxiflorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered geranium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which can last from spring through early autumn."
