    "intro": "Erycibe crassipes, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has specialized aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy substrates and facilitate gas exchange. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in greenish-white or pinkish hues. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains a single seed, aiding in its dispersal by birds and other animals."
