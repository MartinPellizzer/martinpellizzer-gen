    "intro": "Ehretia formosa, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright purple berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy fruiting display."
