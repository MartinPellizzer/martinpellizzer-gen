    "intro": "Elytrigia pachyneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. Elytrigia pachyneura is characterized by its distinct, two-lobed lemma and is often found in temperate climates."
