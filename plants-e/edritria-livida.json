    "intro": "Edritria livida, commonly known as the blue ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and slender, wiry stems that often grow along tree trunks or branches. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom during the dry season, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Edritria livida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
