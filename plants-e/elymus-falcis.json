    "intro": "Elymus falcis, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a bluish-green color, with a rough texture. Elymus falcis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
