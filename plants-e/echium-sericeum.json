    "intro": "Echium sericeum, commonly known as silky fleabane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Echium sericeum is a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its medicinal and ornamental uses."
