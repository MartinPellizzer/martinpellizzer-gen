    "intro": "Eberlanzia cradokensis, commonly known as the Cradock's evergreen, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 2 meters, with woody stems and dense foliage. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are often pink or white and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Eberlanzia cradokensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
