    "intro": "Eucalyptus calophylla var. rubra, commonly known as the red-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, globular white or pale yellow flowers, followed by woody capsules that release small, brown seeds. This species is adapted to coastal and subtropical environments, often found in sandy soils and open woodlands."
