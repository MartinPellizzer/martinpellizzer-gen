It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like appearance with white to pale blue flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and prairies, often in regions with well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, though the variety glabratus has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
