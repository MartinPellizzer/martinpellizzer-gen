It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces dark green, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the pseudobulbs. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Epidendrum geminatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable growing conditions."
