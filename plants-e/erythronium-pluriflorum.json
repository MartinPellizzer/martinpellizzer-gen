It features a single, waxy, purple flower that emerges from a broad, heart-shaped leaf. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a short blooming period in early spring. Its flowers have three petals and three sepals, which are often tinged with green at the base. The roots are tuberous, allowing the plant to survive through harsh winter conditions."
