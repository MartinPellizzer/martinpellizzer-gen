    "intro": "Euphorbia flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, meandering stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cup-shaped structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Euphorbia flexuosa is a succulent plant with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
