    "intro": "Eremomastax, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa and Namibia. Eremomastax species are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water, featuring deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. The genus includes several species, such as Eremomastax glabrata and Eremomastax trichocarpa, which are often cultivated for their ornamental value in xeriscaping."
