    "intro": "Eranthus, commonly known as the winter heliotrope, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often violet or blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Eranthus species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits. The genus includes several species, with Eranthus tinctorius being the most well-known for its ornamental value."
