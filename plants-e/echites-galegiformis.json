    "intro": "Echites galegiformis, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant has finely divided leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters with muddy bottoms. Its carnivorous nature helps it supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
