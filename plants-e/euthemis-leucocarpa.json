    "intro": "Euthemis leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its white, fleshy fruits are a distinguishing feature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Euthemis leucocarpa is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry, rocky habitats."
