    "intro": "Epipactis hispida, commonly known as the hairy helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears clusters of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers have a unique structure with a prominent, spurred labellum that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Epipactis hispida is known for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions, making it a common sight in forest understories."
