    "intro": "Epidendrum mapiriense, commonly known as the Mapiri orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum mapiriense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses and gardens."
