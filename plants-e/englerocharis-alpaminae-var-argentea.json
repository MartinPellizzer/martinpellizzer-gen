    "intro": "Englerocharis alpaminae var. argentea, commonly known as the silver-stemmed alpine orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, silver-green stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
