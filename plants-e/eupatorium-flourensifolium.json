It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
