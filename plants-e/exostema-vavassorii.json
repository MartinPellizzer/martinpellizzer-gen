    "intro": "Exostema vavassorii, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces showy, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are small, spiny, and often shed as the plant matures. Exostema vavassorii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
