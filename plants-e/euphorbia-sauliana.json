    "intro": "Euphorbia sauliana, commonly known as the Canary Island spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in a thick layer of white, waxy sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid or rocky environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
