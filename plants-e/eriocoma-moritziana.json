    "intro": "Eriocoma moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's ericoid, is a low-growing shrub native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the spring. Its compact form and dense growth make it well-suited for rocky or well-drained soils. Eriocoma moritziana is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
