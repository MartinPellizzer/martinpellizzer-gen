    "intro": "Eriocaulon truncatum var. florensense, commonly known as the Florencia marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, narrow leaves arranged in a dense rosette, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in moist habitats. The species is characterized by its compact stature and ability to tolerate waterlogged soils."
