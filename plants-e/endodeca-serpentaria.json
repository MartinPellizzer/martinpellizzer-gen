    "intro": "Endodeca serpentaria, commonly known as the serpent's tail, is a striking plant native to the shaded understories of temperate forests. It features elongated, spiral-shaped leaves that resemble a serpent's body, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Endodeca serpentaria is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and ability to add texture to woodland gardens."
