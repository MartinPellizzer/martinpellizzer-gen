    "intro": "Erythroxylum macrophyllum var. ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian large-leafed coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is notable for its alkaloid content, particularly cocaine, which has significant pharmacological and cultural importance. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also classified as a controlled substance in many countries."
