    "intro": "Ehretia decaryi, commonly known as the African snowbell, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late winter or early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
