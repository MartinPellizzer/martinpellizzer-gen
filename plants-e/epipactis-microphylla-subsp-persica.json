    "intro": "Epipactis microphylla subsp. persica, commonly known as the Persian lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces a showy inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
