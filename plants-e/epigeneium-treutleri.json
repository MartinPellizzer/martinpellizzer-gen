    "intro": "Epigeneium treutleri, commonly known as the climbing ivy vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, with a spatulate leaf-like structure. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly along the ground or climb on structures. Epigeneium treutleri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover surfaces."
