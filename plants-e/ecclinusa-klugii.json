    "intro": "Ecclinusa klugii, commonly known as the Klug's ecclinusa, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Ecclinusa klugii is typically found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
