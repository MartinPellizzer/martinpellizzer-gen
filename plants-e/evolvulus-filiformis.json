    "intro": "Evolvulus filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant is an annual vine that thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, giving it its common name."
