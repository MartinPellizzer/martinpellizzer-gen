    "intro": "Erythroxylum coelophlebium var. petiolatum, commonly known as the petioled copal tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with prominent petioles. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition into copal, a resinous substance used historically in incense and medicine. Its botanical features include a rugged bark and a preference for humid, well-drained soils in tropical highlands. This variety is notable for its ecological and cultural significance in its native habitat."
