    "intro": "Eriogonum polifolium, commonly known as the many-leaved buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. Eriogonum polifolium plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a hardy species adapted to arid environments."
