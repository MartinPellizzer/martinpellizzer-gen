    "intro": "Epidendrum orthodontum, commonly known as the straight-toothed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with distinct, tooth-like markings on the petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum orthodontum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
