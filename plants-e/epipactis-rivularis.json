    "intro": "Epipactis rivularis, commonly known as the water helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Its flowers are pollinated by flies and bees, and it is often found in association with other wetland plants. Epipactis rivularis is known for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is considered an indicator species for wetland habitats."
