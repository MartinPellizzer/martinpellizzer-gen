    "intro": "Eragrostis densa, commonly known as dense bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Eragrostis densa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
