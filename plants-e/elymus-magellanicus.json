    "intro": "Elymus magellanicus, commonly known as the Magellanic wild rye, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bend at the base. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, awned lemmas. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky slopes, often in temperate to cold climates. Elymus magellanicus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
