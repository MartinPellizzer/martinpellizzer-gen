It can grow up to 40 meters in height, with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds.
