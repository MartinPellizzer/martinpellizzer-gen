    "intro": "Euphorbia cuneneana subsp. rhizomatosa, commonly known as the Cunene milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features erect, branching stems covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its root system includes rhizomes, which allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
