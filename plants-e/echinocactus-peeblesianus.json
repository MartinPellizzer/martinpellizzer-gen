    "intro": "Echinocactus peeblesianus, commonly known as the Peebles hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in dry gardens."
