    "intro": "Elaeagnus ferruginea var. atrovirens, commonly known as the blackleaf silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-green foliage, which turns coppery-red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to edible berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
