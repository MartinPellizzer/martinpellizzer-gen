    "intro": "Erythrina \u00d7 sykesii, commonly known as the hybrid flame tree, is a tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, attracting birds and insects. The plant has pinnate leaves with three to seven leaflets and produces elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used as an ornamental in gardens and parks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it also plays a role in soil enrichment and erosion control."
