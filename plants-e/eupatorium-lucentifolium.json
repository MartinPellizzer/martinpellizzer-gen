It features tall, sturdy stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with prominent veins and a silvery underside that gives it its common name. It thrives in wet or moist soils and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks."
