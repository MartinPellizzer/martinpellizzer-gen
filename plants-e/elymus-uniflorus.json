    "intro": "Elymus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with a single floret per spikelet. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes. Elymus uniflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
