    "intro": "Euphorbia cap-saintemariensis var. tulearensis, commonly known as the Tuleare euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the warm season, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
