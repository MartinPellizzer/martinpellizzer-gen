    "intro": "Euphorbia sumbawensis, commonly known as the Sumbawa spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Euphorbia sumbawensis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions. It is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil, making it a resilient and hardy species."
