    "intro": "Eucalyptus coolabah var. rhodoclada, commonly known as the red bloodwood, is a distinctive eucalyptus species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often displays a reddish hue, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically grey-green in color, with a rough texture. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are clustered in umbels, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This hardy tree is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in woodlands and on rocky outcrops."
