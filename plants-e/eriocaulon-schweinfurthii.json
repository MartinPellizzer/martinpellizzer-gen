    "intro": "Eriocaulon schweinfurthii, commonly known as the swamp pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in swampy or marshy habitats. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Eriocaulon schweinfurthii is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, muddy environments and is often used in aquatic gardening and wetland restoration projects."
