    "intro": "Elymus scirpeus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Elymus scirpeus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
