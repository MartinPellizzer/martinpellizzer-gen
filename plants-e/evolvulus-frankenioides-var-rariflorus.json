    "intro": "Evolvulus frankenioides var. rariflorus, commonly known as the rare-flowered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
