    "intro": "Eugenia capoasensis, commonly known as the Capoas cherry, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible red berries that are similar in appearance to cherries, which are used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
