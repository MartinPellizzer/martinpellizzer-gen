    "intro": "Elymus ugamicus, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Elymus ugamicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor, arid conditions."
