    "intro": "Elymus purpurascens, commonly known as purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that often display a reddish-purple hue, especially during the flowering season. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Elymus purpurascens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional plant communities."
