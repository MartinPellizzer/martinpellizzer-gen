    "intro": "Epipactis subclausa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is notable for its ability to mimic the appearance of other plants, a trait known as mimicry, which may aid in its pollination strategy."
