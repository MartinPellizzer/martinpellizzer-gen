    "intro": "Euphorbia caducifolia, commonly known as the autumn euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, green stems that often turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture. Euphorbia caducifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
