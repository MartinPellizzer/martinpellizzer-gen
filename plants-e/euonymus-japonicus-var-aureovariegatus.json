    "intro": "Euonymus japonicus var. aureovariegatus, commonly known as the Japanese spurge or golden variegated euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features attractive, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with prominent yellow or white variegation. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to reveal seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its foliage rather than its flowers. This species thrives in partial to full shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a ground cover."
