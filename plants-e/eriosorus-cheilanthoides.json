    "intro": "Eriosorus cheilanthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped spore cases. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. Its reproductive structures, called soruses, are clustered along the fronds and contain the spores necessary for propagation. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
