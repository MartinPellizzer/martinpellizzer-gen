    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 schmalhausenii nothosubsp. zaissii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Epipactis helleborine and Epipactis leptotoma. It is characterized by its greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. This nothosubspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and ecological adaptability."
