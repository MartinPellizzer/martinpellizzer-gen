    "intro": "Epidendrum panchrysum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cascade of golden bells. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Epidendrum panchrysum is valued in horticulture for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements."
