    "intro": "Ephedra graeca, commonly known as Greek ephedra, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its stimulant properties. However, due to its alkaloid content, it requires careful handling and is regulated in many regions."
