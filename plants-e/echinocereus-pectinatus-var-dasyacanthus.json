    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus var. dasyacanthus, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a dense, globular shape and a distinctive red or purple coloration during the flowering season. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
