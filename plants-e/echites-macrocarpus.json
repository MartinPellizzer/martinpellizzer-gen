    "intro": "Echites macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has a straight, slender trunk with smooth, greyish bark, and its leaves are pinnate, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
