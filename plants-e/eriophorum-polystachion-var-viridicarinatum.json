    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion var. viridicarinatum, commonly known as the green-ribbed tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant grows in wet to moist habitats such as bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a distinct midrib that is prominently visible. This variant is distinguished by its vibrant green coloration and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
