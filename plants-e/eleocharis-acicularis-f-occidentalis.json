It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
