    "intro": "Erica fuscata, commonly known as the common heath, is a shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Erica fuscata produces pale pink or white flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes."
