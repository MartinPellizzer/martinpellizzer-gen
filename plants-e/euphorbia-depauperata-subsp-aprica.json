    "intro": "Euphorbia depauperata subsp. aprica, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
