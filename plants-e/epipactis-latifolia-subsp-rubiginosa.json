    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia subsp. rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-tongued helleborine, is a herbaceous perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features broad, pleated leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive red or orange lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The subspecies is distinguished by its reddish markings on the lip and its slightly different morphology compared to other Epipactis species."
