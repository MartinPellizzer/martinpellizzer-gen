It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically reddish or yellowish when ripe, though they are not widely cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes grown in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
