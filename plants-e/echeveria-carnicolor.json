It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves with red and pink edges that intensify in sunlight. The plant produces showy clusters of yellow flowers in spring, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its compact size and vibrant colors, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
