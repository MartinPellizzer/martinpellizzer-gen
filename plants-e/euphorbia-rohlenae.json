    "intro": "Euphorbia rohlenae, commonly known as the Red Rock Euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Namibia. It features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a desirable specimen for rock gardens. Euphorbia rohlenae is also noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique appearance."
