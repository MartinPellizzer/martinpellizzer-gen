    "intro": "Elatostema frutescens var. novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows as a low shrub with thick, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are usually borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are characterized by their velvety texture and ability to retain moisture, an adaptation to its humid, tropical habitat. This species is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
