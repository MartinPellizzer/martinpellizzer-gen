    "intro": "Euphorbia nurae, commonly known as the Nura's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its tissues. Euphorbia nurae is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
