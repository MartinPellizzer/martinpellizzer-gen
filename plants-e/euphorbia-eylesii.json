    "intro": "Euphorbia eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' spurge, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to red. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
