It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a velvety texture due to dense pubescence on both surfaces. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
