It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, spreading growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for erosion control. Its ornamental value and adaptability have led to its use in landscaping and restoration projects."
