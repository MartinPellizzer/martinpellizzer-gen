    "intro": "Erigeron cochlearifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, blooming in summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Erigeron cochlearifolius is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
