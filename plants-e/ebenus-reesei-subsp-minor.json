    "intro": "Ebenus reesei subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, and it produces small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in environments with minimal water availability. Its growth habit and appearance make it a characteristic component of desert and steppe ecosystems."
