    "intro": "Eriogonum vimineum, commonly known as the creeping sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum vimineum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in coastal and inland desert regions."
