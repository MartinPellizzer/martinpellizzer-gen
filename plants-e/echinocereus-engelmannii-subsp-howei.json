    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. howei, commonly known as the Howei prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and bats. Its fruit, a fleshy pear-shaped structure, is edible and contains a high concentration of sugars and acids. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
