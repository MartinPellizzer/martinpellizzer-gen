It is characterized by its coniferous habit, with needle-like leaves that are short and densely packed. The plant produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain seeds enclosed in a woody covering. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
