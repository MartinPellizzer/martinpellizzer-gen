It is characterized by its hairy, fleshy fruits that are covered in a sticky substance, which is a unique botanical feature. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, while its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms. The fruit, although edible in some cultures, is often used in traditional medicine due to its reported health benefits."
