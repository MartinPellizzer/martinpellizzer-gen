    "intro": "Euphorbia cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution."
