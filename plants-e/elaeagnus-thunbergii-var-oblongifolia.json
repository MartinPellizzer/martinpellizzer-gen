It is characterized by its silvery-white, velvety foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, red-orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen. This variety is particularly valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
