    "intro": "Eupatorium decumbens var. stenum, commonly known as the creeping boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in composite heads and bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks."
