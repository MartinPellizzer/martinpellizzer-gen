    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudovillosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia pseudovillosa is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in its native habitat."
