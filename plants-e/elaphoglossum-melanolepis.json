    "intro": "Elaphoglossum melanolepis, commonly known as the black-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum melanolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
