    "intro": "Euphorbia arida, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a short, thick stem with sparse, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia arida is well adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
