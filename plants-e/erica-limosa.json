    "intro": "Erica limosa, commonly known as the bog heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands, bogs, and coastal areas. Erica limosa has small, leathery leaves that are dark green and densely packed, contributing to its compact appearance. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity."
