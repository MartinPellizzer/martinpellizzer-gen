    "intro": "Euphorbia adenophylla, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features distinctive, thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, known as latex, contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia adenophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
