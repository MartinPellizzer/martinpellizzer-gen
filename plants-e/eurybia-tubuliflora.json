    "intro": "Eurybia tubuliflora, commonly known as the sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble small, clustered holly berries. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eurybia tubuliflora thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems."
