    "intro": "Eclecticus, commonly known as the eclectus parrot, is a species of parrot native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. While not a plant, it is often confused with the Eclectus rhabdopus, a type of palm tree found in the Caribbean. The Eclectus rhabdopus is a small, evergreen tree that thrives in humid, coastal environments. It has a distinctive appearance with a narrow trunk and pinnate leaves. This palm is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
