    "intro": "Eulophia seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces long, slender leaves and bears racemes of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Eulophia seychellarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest for its ecological role in its native habitat."
