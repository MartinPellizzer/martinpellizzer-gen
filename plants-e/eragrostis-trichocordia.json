It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that form dense, low-growing clumps. The leaves are narrow, linear, and have a distinctive two-sided (trichocordate) appearance, giving the plant its scientific name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its elegant, flowing form and adaptability to various soil conditions."
