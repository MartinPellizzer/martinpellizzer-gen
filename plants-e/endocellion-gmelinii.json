    "intro": "Endocellion gmelinii, commonly known as the small-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive triangular cross-section typical of the Cyperaceae family. The small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
