    "intro": "Elymus caespitosus, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Blue grama is an important component of native grasslands and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological value."
