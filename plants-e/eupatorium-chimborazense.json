    "intro": "Eupatorium chimborazense, commonly known as the Andean thoroughwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom during the cooler months. Eupatorium chimborazense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some South American cultures."
