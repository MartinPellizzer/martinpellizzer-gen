    "intro": "Eragrostis pectinacea var. refracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for native wildlife."
