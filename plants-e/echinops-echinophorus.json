    "intro": "Echinops echinophorus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which give it its common name. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops echinophorus is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water availability."
