    "intro": "Erodium camposianum, commonly known as the Brazilian catchfly, is a small annual herb native to South America. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are covered in fine hairs. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Erodium camposianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinators."
