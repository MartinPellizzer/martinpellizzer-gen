    "intro": "Eremogone congesta var. simulans, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize loose soils and prevent erosion. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
