It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The leaves are ovate to broadly ovate, often with serrated edges, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This species thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and pollinator support."
