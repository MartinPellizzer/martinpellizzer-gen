    "intro": "Erythrina fulgens, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its bark is smooth and often reddish in color. It produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Erythrina fulgens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
