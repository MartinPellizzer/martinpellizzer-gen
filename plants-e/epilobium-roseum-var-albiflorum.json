It typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
