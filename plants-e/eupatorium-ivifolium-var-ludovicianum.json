    "intro": "Eupatorium ivifolium var. ludovicianum, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are arranged in cone-shaped clusters at the tops of the stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. This variety is often found in moist to wet environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks."
