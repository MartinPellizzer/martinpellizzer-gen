    "intro": "Euphorbia negromontana, commonly known as the Black Mountain spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
