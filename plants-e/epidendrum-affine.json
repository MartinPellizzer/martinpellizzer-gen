    "intro": "Epidendrum affine, commonly known as the common epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright, often branching growth habit and its relatively small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red hues. Epidendrum affine is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and is popular among orchid growers for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
