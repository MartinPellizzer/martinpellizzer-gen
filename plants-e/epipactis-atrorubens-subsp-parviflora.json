    "intro": "Epipactis atrorubens subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from purple to brown. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are arranged in a spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flowers and shorter floral bracts compared to other members of the species."
