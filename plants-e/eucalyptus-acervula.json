    "intro": "Eucalyptus acervula, commonly known as the small-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale green or yellow flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat. The bark is often flaky or scaly, and the plant plays an important role in its native ecosystem."
