    "intro": "Erucago macroptera, commonly known as the giant erucoid, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in a branched cluster. The plant produces a distinctive seed capsule that splits open to release its seeds, a feature typical of many species in the Onagraceae family. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Erucago macroptera is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
