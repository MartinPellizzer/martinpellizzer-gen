    "intro": "Encelia asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf encelia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured foliage and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and desert scrub habitats. Its structure consists of multiple stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Encelia asperifolia is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
