    "intro": "Euphorbia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with a thick, fleshy stem and bright green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems. Euphorbia decipiens is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
