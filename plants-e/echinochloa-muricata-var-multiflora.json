    "intro": "Echinochloa muricata var. multiflora, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
