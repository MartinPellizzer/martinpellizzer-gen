    "intro": "Eucalyptus mahoganii, commonly known as the mahogany eucalyptus, is a tall tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in long strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, and its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. This species is adapted to dry, coastal environments and is often found in sclerophyllous forests."
