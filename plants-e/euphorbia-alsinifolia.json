    "intro": "Euphorbia alsinifolia, commonly known as the leafless euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring a short, thick stem with no leaves, and it produces a crown of yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which is known for its diverse and often spiny members. Euphorbia alsinifolia stores water in its stem, making it adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, a defining feature of the genus Euphorbia."
