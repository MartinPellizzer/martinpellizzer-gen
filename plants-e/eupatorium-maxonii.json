    "intro": "Eupatorium maxonii, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, clay soils. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Its showy, clustered flowers are usually pink to purple, blooming from late summer to early fall. Eupatorium maxonii plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
