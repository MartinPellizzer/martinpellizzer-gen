    "intro": "Eugenia lutea, commonly known as the yellow eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, bright yellow berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Eugenia lutea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
