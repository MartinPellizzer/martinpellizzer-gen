    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 limosum, commonly known as the sticky willow or common willow herb, is a hybrid species within the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that give its stems and leaves a sticky texture. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and roadside ditches. Its flowers are showy, with five pink or reddish petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Epilobium \u00d7 limosum is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
