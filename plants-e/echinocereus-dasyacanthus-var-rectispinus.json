    "intro": "Echinocereus dasyacanthus var. rectispinus, commonly known as the stiff-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, solitary cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches near the base. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are stiff and often have a reddish or brownish hue, providing protection from herbivores. This drought-tolerant species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
