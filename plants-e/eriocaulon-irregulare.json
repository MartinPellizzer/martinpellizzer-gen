    "intro": "Eriocaulon irregulare, commonly known as the irregular spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence that bears tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
