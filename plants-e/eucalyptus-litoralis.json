    "intro": "Eucalyptus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually narrow and pointed. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale green, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus litoralis is well adapted to salty sea air and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
