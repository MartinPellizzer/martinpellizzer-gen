    "intro": "Elaphoglossum mainahasae, commonly known as the Mainahasae holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light provided by the canopy. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, the conservation status of this species remains uncertain."
