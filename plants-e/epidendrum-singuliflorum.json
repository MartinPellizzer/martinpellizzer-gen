    "intro": "Epidendrum singuliflorum, commonly known as the single-flower epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a single bloom per inflorescence, making it distinctive. The leaves are broad and ovate, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs."
