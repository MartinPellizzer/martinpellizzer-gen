    "intro": "Eriochloa gracilis var. minor, commonly known as slender false brome, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense stands. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
