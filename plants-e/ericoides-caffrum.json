    "intro": "Ericoides caffrum, commonly known as the Cape heath, is a hardy shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ericoides caffrum is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
