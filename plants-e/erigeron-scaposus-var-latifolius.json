    "intro": "Erigeron scaposus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it produces showy white to pale blue ray flowers. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
