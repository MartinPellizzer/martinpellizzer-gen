    "intro": "Echinops transcaucasicus, commonly known as the Transcaucasian thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a sea urchin, giving it its genus name \"Echinops.\" The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Echinops transcaucasicus is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
