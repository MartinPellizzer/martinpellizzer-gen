    "intro": "Eucalyptus bigalerita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are usually pink or red, which open to reveal white or pale pink flowers. Its bark is often flaky and peels away in thin strips, revealing a smooth, pale underneath layer. Eucalyptus bigalerita is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for dry landscapes."
