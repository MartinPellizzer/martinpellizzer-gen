    "intro": "Erysimum capitatum var. washoense, commonly known as the Wasco's wallflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
