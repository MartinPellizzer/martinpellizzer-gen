It belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae) and is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a glandular surface that produces a sticky secretion. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, pod-like fruit that bursts open to disperse seeds upon maturity."
