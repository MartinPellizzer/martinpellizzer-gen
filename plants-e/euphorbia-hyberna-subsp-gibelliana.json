    "intro": "Euphorbia hyberna subsp. gibelliana, commonly known as the Irish spurge, is a low-growing succulent plant native to western Europe. It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
