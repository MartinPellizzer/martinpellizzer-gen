It features striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting dark veins. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water, helping it survive dry periods. The species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
