It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. The varietal name \"vulcanica\" reflects its association with volcanic soils and its ability to flourish in such conditions."
