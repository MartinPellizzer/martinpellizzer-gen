    "intro": "Ervatamia inaequalifolia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples for their purported healing properties."
