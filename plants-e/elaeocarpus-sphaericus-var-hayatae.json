    "intro": "Elaeocarpus sphaericus var. hayatae, commonly known as the Japanese rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is a spherical, woody capsule that contains several seeds, and it is known for its hard, heavy wood that is highly valued in traditional craftsmanship. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
