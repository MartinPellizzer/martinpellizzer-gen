    "intro": "Euonymus laetus, commonly known as the spreading euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Euonymus laetus is also valued for its use in landscaping and as a ground cover."
