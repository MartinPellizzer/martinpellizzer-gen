It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are usually elliptical or oblong, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum bipapulare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
