    "intro": "Epidendrum coriifolium, commonly known as the waxy leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Epidendrum coriifolium is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
