    "intro": "Euphorbia cyparissias var. pubescens, commonly known as the wooly cypress spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense, dark green foliage covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique appearance and ability to thrive in sunny, arid conditions."
