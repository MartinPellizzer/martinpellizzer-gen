It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its rhizome system supports the development of its towering structure, while its spore-bearing cones are typically found at the base of the fronds. Ectopopterys soejartoi plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
