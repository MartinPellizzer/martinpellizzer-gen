    "intro": "Euphorbia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia glabrata is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
