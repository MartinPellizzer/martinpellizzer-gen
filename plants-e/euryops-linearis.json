    "intro": "Euryops linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its linear, lance-shaped leaves are a distinguishing feature, and it produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Euryops linearis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
