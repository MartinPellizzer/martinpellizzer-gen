    "intro": "Echinopsis cochabambensis, commonly known as the Cochabamba moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Bolivia. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, globular shape, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Echinopsis cochabambensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
