    "intro": "Endorima uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Endorima uniflora is considered a vulnerable species."
