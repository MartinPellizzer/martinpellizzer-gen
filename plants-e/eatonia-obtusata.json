    "intro": "Eatonia obtusata, commonly known as the broadleaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its stems are cylindrical and can branch out, forming a low-growing shrub. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
