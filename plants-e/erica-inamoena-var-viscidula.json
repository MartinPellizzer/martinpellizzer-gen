    "intro": "Erica inamoena var. viscidula, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
