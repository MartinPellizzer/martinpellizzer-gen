    "intro": "Echinopsis terscheckii var. montana, commonly known as the mountain moon cactus, is a compact cacti species native to South America. It features a short, thick stem covered in white, woolly spines that help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
