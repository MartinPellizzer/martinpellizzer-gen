    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ruficomum, commonly known as the red-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum ruficomum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to add a lush, tropical feel to shaded garden spaces."
