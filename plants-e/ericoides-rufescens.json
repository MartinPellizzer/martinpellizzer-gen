    "intro": "Ericoides rufescens, commonly known as the red-bark heath, is a shrub native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, often with a reddish hue on the underside, contributing to its common name. Ericoides rufescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, compact growth."
