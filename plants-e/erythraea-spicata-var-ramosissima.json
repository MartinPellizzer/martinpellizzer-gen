    "intro": "Erythraea spicata var. ramosissima, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and profuse clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native range."
