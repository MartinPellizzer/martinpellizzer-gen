    "intro": "Erica lignosa, commonly known as the silver leaf heath, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is covered in a fine layer of silvery-white wax. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in spring. Erica lignosa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
