    "intro": "Eria, commonly known as the orchid genus, consists of over 300 species native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers and are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Eria species have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are often aerial, absorbing moisture from the air. They thrive in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Many Eria orchids are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
