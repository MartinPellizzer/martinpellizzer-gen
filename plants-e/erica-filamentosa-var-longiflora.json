    "intro": "Erica filamentosa var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, needle-like foliage that is typically a deep green, often with a slight bluish or silver hue. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal landscapes."
