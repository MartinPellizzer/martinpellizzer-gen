    "intro": "Erythroxylum squamatum var. typicum, commonly known as the woolly coca, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of trichomes on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elliptical, dark purple to black berries. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is closely related to the genus Erythroxylum, which includes coca and Coca. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also of interest in both botanical and ethnopharmacological studies."
