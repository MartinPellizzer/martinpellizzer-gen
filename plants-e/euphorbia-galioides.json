    "intro": "Euphorbia galioides, commonly known as the marsh spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in saturated soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks. Euphorbia galioides is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
