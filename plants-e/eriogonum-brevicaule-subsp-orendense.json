    "intro": "Eriogonum brevicaule subsp. orendense, commonly known as the Orenden's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of local plant communities."
