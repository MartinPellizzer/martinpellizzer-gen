    "intro": "Eulychnia aricensis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and produces vibrant pink to red blooms during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Eulychnia aricensis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
