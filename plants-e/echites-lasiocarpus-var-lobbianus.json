    "intro": "Echites lasiocarpus var. lobbianus, commonly known as the rough-haircup, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and compound umbels of small white flowers. The plant features a creeping rhizome system with hairy, lobed leaves that are often glandular and emit a strong odor when crushed. Its fruiting bodies are small, dry fruits that split open to release seeds, a typical feature of the carrot family. This variant is distinguished by its more lobed leaves and rough texture compared to other varieties within the species."
