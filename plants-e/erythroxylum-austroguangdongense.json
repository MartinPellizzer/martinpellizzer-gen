    "intro": "Erythroxylum austroguangdongense, commonly known as the Guangdong erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to southern China, particularly the Guangdong province, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by oval-shaped berries. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
