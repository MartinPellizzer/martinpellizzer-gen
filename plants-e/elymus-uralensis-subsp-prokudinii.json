    "intro": "Elymus uralensis subsp. prokudinii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in harsh environments, including permafrost and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often densely arranged along the stems. It is well adapted to cold climates and can withstand long winters with heavy snow cover. This subspecies is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies due to its resilience and potential for land reclamation."
