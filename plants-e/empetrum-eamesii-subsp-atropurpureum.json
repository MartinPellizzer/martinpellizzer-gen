    "intro": "Empetrum eamesii subsp. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple willow-rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, dark green leaves that turn reddish-purple in the fall, adding ornamental value to its appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
