    "intro": "Eucalyptus ficifolia var. bakeri, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a striking red or pinkish color beneath. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a rough texture. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in winter. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
