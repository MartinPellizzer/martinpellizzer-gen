    "intro": "Echites laxus, commonly known as the slender echites, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring woody stems and opposite leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Echites laxus is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts to dry conditions with its drought-resistant properties."
