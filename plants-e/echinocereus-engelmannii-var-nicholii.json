    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii var. nicholii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spiny cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are narrow and spine-tipped, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
