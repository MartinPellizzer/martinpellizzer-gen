    "intro": "Euphorbia variabilis subsp. valliniana, commonly known as the variable spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia variabilis subsp. valliniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
