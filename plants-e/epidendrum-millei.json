    "intro": "Epidendrum millei, commonly known as the Orchid of the Gods, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, warm environments. The plant produces long, pendant inflorescences with numerous showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Epidendrum millei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
