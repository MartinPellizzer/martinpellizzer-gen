    "intro": "Erica atroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow or brownish in color. Erica atroviridis is evergreen, with dense, leathery foliage that provides year-round structure. It is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in acidic, poor soils."
