It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are usually pink or white and are clustered in small, rounded inflorescences.
