    "intro": "Erophila chlorotica, commonly known as the green leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and simple, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Erophila chlorotica is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and waste areas. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
