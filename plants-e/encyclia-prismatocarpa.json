It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive prism-like structure on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as cloud forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. The orchid is pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, which are attracted to its sweet fragrance and nectar-rich flowers."
