    "intro": "Etoxoe aromatica, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil of its natural habitat. Etoxoe aromatica is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its use in traditional herbal medicine."
