    "intro": "Euphorbia parviceps, commonly known as the miniature spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and a short, branching stem. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
