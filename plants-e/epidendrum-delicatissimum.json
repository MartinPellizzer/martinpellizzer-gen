    "intro": "Epidendrum delicatissimum, commonly known as the delicate epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its gracefully drooping, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Epidendrum delicatissimum prefers bright, indirect light and consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
