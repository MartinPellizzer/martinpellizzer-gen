    "intro": "Euphorbia cuspidata, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous spiny, upright branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually small and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Euphorbia cuspidata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique form and resilience."
