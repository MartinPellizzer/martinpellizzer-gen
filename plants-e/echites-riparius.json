    "intro": "Echites riparius, commonly known as the river thistle, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves covered in coarse hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil along riverbanks. Echites riparius is adapted to moist environments and is often found in areas with periodic flooding."
