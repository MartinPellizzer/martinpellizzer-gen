It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
