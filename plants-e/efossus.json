    "intro": "Efossus, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Efossus is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
