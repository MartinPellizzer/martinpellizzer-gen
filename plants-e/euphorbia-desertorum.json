    "intro": "Euphorbia desertorum, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia desertorum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
