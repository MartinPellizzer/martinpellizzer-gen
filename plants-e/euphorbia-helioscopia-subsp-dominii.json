    "intro": "Euphorbia helioscopia subsp. dominii, commonly known as the sun spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
