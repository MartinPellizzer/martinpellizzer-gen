    "intro": "Epidendrum miserum, commonly known as the sad Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. Epidendrum miserum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
