It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
