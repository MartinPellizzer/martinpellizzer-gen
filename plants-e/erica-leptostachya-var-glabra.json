    "intro": "Erica leptostachya var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, glandular pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
