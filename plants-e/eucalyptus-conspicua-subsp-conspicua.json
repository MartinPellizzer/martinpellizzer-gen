    "intro": "Eucalyptus conspicua subsp. conspicua, commonly known as the red gum, is a medium to large tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for timber and fuel. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both coastal and inland regions."
