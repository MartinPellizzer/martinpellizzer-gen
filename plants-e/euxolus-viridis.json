    "intro": "Euxolus viridis, commonly known as the green euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
