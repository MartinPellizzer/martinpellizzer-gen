    "intro": "Erica phaeocarpa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family (Ericaceae). It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves. Its flowers are typically pale pink to white, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Erica phaeocarpa is well adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
