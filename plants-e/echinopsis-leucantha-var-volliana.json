    "intro": "Echinopsis leucantha var. volliana, commonly known as the White-topped Cereus, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
