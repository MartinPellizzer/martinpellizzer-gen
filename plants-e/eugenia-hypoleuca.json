    "intro": "Eugenia hypoleuca, commonly known as the white eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a slightly glossy surface. Eugenia hypoleuca is often found in coastal and tableland regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
