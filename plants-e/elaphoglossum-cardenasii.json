    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cardenasii, commonly known as the C\u00e1rdenas holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
