    "intro": "Epithema longipetiolatum, commonly known as the long-petioled epiphyte, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender petioles that help it anchor to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Epithema longipetiolatum produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
