    "intro": "Euphorbia enormis, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a striking plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces a unique inflorescence called a cyathium, which contains yellowish flowers surrounded by specialized leaves. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems to survive in arid conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled environments."
