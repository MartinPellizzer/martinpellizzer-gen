    "intro": "Espeletia rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, where it adapts to cold and moist conditions. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soil. Espeletia rufescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
