    "intro": "Enhydrias angustipetala var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved narrow-petioled enhydria, is a rare variant of the enhydria genus. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves with a broad base, which distinguishes it from other varieties. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces distinctive, fleshy fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to plant taxonomists and conservationists."
