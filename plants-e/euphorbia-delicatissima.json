    "intro": "Euphorbia delicatissima, commonly known as the delicate spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, and its leaves are narrow and often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
