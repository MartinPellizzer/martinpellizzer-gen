    "intro": "Evolvulus frankenioides var. elongatus, commonly known as the longleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trumpet-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
