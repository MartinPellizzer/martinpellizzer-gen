It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Elaeagnus pallidiflora is also valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various climates."
