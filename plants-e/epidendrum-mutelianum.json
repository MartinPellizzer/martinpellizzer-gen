    "intro": "Epidendrum mutelianum, commonly known as the Mutelian Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces striking, pendulous flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
