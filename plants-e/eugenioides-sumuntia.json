    "intro": "Eugenioides sumuntia, commonly known as the mountain eugenia, is a shrub native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
