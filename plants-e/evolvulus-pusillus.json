    "intro": "Evolvulus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf morning glory, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ground cover in warm climates."
