    "intro": "Evolvulus helianthemoides, commonly known as the sunflower morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 30 centimeters tall, featuring hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its scientific name reflects its resemblance to both the genus Evolvulus and the sunflower, though it is not related to the sunflower family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
