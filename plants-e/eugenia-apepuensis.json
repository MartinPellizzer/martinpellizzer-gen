    "intro": "Eugenia apepuensis, commonly known as the Apepu endemic guava, is a species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by round, red or purple berries. Eugenia apepuensis is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat, thriving in well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its region."
