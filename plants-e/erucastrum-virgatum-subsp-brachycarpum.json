    "intro": "Erucastrum virgatum subsp. brachycarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its succulent leaves and stems help it retain moisture in dry environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh, drought-prone habitats."
