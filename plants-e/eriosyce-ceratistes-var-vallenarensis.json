    "intro": "Eriosyce ceratistes var. vallenarensis, commonly known as the Vallenarensis Cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly bristles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted coloration. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
