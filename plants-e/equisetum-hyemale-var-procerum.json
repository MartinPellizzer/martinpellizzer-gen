It is a perennial plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are used for reproduction. Its stems are covered in small, scale-like structures that give it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands."
