    "intro": "Eriophyllum caespitosum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf woolly sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are broad and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
