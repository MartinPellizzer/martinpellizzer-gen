    "intro": "Euphorbia controversa, commonly known as the \"Controversial Spurge,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in soft, woolly hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in small, white dots. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, like many euphorbias, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation."
