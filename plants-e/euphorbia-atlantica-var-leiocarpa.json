    "intro": "Euphorbia atlantica var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the Atlantic euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, giving the plant a unique, almost spiny appearance. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats."
