    "intro": "Epimedium platypetalum var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barberry, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to China. It features delicate, elongated leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slight reddish tinge during the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and subtle floral display."
