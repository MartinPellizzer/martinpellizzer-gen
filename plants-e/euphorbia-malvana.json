    "intro": "Euphorbia malvana, commonly known as the yellow-spined spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a milky, toxic latex when damaged, which is a common feature among the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Euphorbia malvana thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
