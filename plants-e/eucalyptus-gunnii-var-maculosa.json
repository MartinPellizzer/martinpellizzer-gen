    "intro": "Eucalyptus gunnii var. maculosa, commonly known as the spotted gum, is a deciduous tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that often displays a distinctive spotted or mottled appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is valued for its timber and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
