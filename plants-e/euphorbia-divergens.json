    "intro": "Euphorbia divergens, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that are covered in small, white, waxy tubercles. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia divergens is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
