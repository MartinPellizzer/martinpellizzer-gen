    "intro": "Euphorbia modesta, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a layer of white, powdery wax that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia modesta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
