    "intro": "Erodium trichomanefolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Erodium trichomanefolium is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in dry, open areas."
