It features small, narrow leaves that are often folded or rolled, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Empodium plicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
