    "intro": "Epistephium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf epistephium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a preference for well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
