    "intro": "Eunomia cochlearina, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which is an adaptation to its harsh, mountainous environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a touch of beauty to its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
