It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It produces small, white to pale yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of tiny florets. Canadian fleabane is often found in open areas and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
