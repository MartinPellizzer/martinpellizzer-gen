It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
