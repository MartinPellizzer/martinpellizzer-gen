    "intro": "Emmenanthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, featuring a single, delicate leaf and a flower that resembles a ghostly, translucent bloom. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in the canopy of forests. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered."
