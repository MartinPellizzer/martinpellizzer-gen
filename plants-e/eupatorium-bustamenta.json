    "intro": "Eupatorium bustamenta, commonly known as the Florida ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium bustamenta plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
