    "intro": "Euxolus mitchellii, commonly known as Mitchell's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Euxolus mitchellii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
