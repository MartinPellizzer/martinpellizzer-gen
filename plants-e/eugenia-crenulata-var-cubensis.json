    "intro": "Eugenia crenulata var. cubensis, commonly known as Cuban cherry or Cuban guanabana, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy berries that are typically bright red or yellow when ripe. These berries are edible, with a sweet, aromatic pulp that has a flavor reminiscent of a combination of pineapple and mango. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit."
