    "intro": "Epilobium ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as along riverbanks and in wet meadows. The plant features erect, often glandular-stemmed shoots with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers are showy, with five pink to purple petals, and are arranged in terminal or axillary clusters. Epilobium ponticum is notable for its adaptability to wet environments and its role in supporting local insect populations."
