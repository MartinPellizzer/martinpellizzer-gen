It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that are often covered in a fine, membranous sheath, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, and it thrives in shallow water or moist soil. Eleocharis membranacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
