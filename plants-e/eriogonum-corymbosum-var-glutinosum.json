    "intro": "Eriogonum corymbosum var. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky leaf buckwheat, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Its sticky foliage is a key adaptation for reducing water loss in arid environments. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
