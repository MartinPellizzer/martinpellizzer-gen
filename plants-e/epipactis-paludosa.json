    "intro": "Epipactis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. The plant has dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive lip structures. Its blooming period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
