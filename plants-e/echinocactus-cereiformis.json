    "intro": "Echinocactus cereiformis, commonly known as the whale's tongue cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a ribbed structure with spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its adaptations make it well-suited for desert environments with limited rainfall. Echinocactus cereiformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
