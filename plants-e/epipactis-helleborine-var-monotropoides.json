    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine var. monotropoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-green flowers with a distinctive lip. This variant is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and forest floors. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies on fungal associations for part of its nutrition. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it often grows in association with specific tree species."
