    "intro": "Echinops villosus, commonly known as the hairy thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small thimbles, which are a key feature in its common name. The plant typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters tall, with grayish-green, hairy stems and leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer, followed by the distinctive seed heads that persist through the winter. Echinops villosus is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
