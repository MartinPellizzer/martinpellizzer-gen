    "intro": "Eriophyllum alternifolium, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow daisies. The plant typically grows in coastal scrub and dunes, thriving in well-drained sandy soils. Its narrow, alternate leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Eriophyllum alternifolium is also known for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and provide habitat for various insects and birds."
