    "intro": "Endlicheria duotincta, commonly known as the two-veined orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers with intricate veining patterns. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are short and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Endlicheria duotincta is considered a vulnerable species."
