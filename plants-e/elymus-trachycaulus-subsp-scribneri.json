    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus subsp. scribneri, commonly known as Scribner's roughgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with brown or purple hues. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and grasslands, showing a high degree of drought tolerance. Its leaves are narrow and rough to the touch, with a distinctive silvery-blue sheen that helps reflect sunlight. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
