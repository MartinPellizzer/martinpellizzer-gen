    "intro": "Epilobium metallicum, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. Epilobium metallicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
