    "intro": "Effusiella werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the spurge family. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, a common trait among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. Effusiella werneri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
