    "intro": "Eugenia hallii, commonly known as the Mexican cherry or Hall's eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are often used in culinary applications, though they are typically consumed raw or processed into jams and syrups. Eugenia hallii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, tropical forest environments. Its ornamental value and edible fruits make it a notable species in both horticulture and local food traditions."
