It is characterized by its large, clustered leaves that can reach several meters in length, giving it a dramatic and imposing appearance. The plant's stems are segmented and covered in a fibrous sheath, which contributes to its unique morphology. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Despite its tropical origin, it can be cultivated in warm climates with proper care and humidity."
