    "intro": "Euonymus tinus, commonly known as the silver euonymus, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from dark green to silver-white, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Euonymus tinus is also valued for its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions, including urban settings."
