    "intro": "Erysimum incanum f. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed wallflower, is a variant of the hairy wallflower native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that features silvery-gray foliage and bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its extended flowering period, from spring to early summer, adds continuous color to the garden. The f. longipes form is distinguished by its longer, more elongated stems compared to the typical form."
