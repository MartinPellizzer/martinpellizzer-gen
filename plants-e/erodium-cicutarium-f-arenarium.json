    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium f. arenarium, commonly known as sand erodium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, pink or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new habitats."
