    "intro": "Euonymus yedoensis, commonly known as the Japanese spindle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive red, inflated seed capsules that persist through winter. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall foliage, which turns brilliant shades of red and orange. Euonymus yedoensis is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
