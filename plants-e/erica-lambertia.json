    "intro": "Erica lambertia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in coastal environments with high salt exposure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are needle-like, gray-green in color, and covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Erica lambertia is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and resilience to harsh conditions."
