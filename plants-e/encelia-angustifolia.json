    "intro": "Encelia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf burrobrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Encelia angustifolia is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is relatively drought-tolerant."
