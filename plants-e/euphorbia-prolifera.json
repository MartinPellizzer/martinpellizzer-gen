    "intro": "Euphorbia prolifera, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Euphorbia prolifera is also noted for its ability to propagate through stem cuttings, which is a common method of propagation for many succulents."
