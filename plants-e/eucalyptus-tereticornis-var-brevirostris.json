    "intro": "Eucalyptus tereticornis var. brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-ridged mallees, is a variant of the narrow-leaf mallees, characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. It is native to southern Australia, particularly in regions with sandy soils and dry climates. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and have a smooth, often greyish-green appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually pale or creamy white, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. This variant is adapted to arid environments and is often used in landscaping for its hardy and drought-resistant qualities."
