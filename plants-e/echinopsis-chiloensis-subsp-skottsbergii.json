    "intro": "Echinopsis chiloensis subsp. skottsbergii, commonly known as the Skottsberg's moon cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a short, branched root system adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
