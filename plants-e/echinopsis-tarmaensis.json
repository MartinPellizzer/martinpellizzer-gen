    "intro": "Echinopsis tarmaensis, commonly known as the Tarma echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and botanical collections."
