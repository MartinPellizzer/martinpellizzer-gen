    "intro": "Equisetum funstonii var. caespitosum, commonly known as the Funston's horse tail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are essential for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
