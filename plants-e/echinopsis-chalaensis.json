    "intro": "Echinopsis chalaensis, commonly known as the Chalae\u00f1as night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of central Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Echinopsis chalaensis is a striking example of desert flora with unique adaptations for survival."
