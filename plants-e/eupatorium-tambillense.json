    "intro": "Eupatorium tambillense, commonly known as the Tumbilla feverfew, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. Eupatorium tambillense is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties."
