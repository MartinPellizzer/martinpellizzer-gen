    "intro": "Ehrharta urvilleana, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of soft, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Velvet grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some traditional practices."
