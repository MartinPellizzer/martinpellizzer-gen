    "intro": "Euphorbia lissosperma, commonly known as the smooth-spined euphorbia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a succulent stem and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia lissosperma is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
