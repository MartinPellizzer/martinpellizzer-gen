    "intro": "Eulophia fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandez's eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a greenish tinge. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
