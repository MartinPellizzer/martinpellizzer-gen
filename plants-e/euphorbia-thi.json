    "intro": "Euphorbia thi, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted for water storage, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia thi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and distinctive appearance."
