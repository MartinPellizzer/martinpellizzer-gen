    "intro": "Enarthrocarpus strangulatus var. amalecitanus, commonly known as the Amalecitanus strangler, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and ability to envelop host trees, forming a dense canopy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
