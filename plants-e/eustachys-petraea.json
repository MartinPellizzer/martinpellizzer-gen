    "intro": "Eustachys petraea, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Eustachys petraea is often found in rocky outcrops and along mountain slopes, where it contributes to the ecological stability of these habitats."
