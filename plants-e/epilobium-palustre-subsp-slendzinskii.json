    "intro": "Epilobium palustre subsp. slendzinskii, commonly known as Slendzinsky's willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy surface. It produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
