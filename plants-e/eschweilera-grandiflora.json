    "intro": "Eschweilera grandiflora, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat without parasitizing them. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment of the rainforest. Eschweilera grandiflora is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting biodiversity."
