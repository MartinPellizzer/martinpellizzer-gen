    "intro": "Epithecia calyculata, commonly known as the yellow cup lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange apothecia, which are typically cup-shaped and surrounded by a distinct marginal rim. The thallus is foliose, meaning it has a leaf-like structure, and is often found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions. This lichen is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and habitat specificity."
