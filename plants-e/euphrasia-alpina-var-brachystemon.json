    "intro": "Euphrasia alpina var. brachystemon, commonly known as the Alpine eyebright, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stems compared to the typical form of Euphrasia alpina."
