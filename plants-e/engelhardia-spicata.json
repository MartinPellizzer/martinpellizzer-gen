    "intro": "Engelhardia spicata, commonly known as the silky pine or silky sassafras, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Engelhardia spicata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along streamlines."
