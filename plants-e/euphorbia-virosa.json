    "intro": "Euphorbia virosa, commonly known as the yellow-spined spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and unique floral structures. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub or perennial herb, often found in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Euphorbia virosa is known for its toxic properties, with the sap containing irritants that can cause skin irritation."
