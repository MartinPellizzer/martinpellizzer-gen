    "intro": "Ecbolium sellinii, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. Ecbolium sellinii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
