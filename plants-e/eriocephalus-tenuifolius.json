    "intro": "Eriocephalus tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eriocephalus, is a small shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
