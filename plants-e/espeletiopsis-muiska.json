    "intro": "Espeletiopsis muiska, commonly known as the Muyska pine, is a species of conifer native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure, typical of the Pinaceae family. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Espeletiopsis muiska is considered a rare and endangered species."
