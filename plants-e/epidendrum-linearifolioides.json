    "intro": "Epidendrum linearifolioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum linearifolioides is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
