    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis var. typica, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that disperse via water or wind. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
