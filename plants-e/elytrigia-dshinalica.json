It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Elytrigia dshinalica is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
