    "intro": "Eupatorium achillea, commonly known as white boneset, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium achillea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
