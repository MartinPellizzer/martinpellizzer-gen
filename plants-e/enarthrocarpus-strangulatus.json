    "intro": "Enarthrocarpus strangulatus, commonly known as the strangler fig, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Moraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and unique method of obtaining nutrients. The plant typically starts as an epiphyte, growing on the branches of a host tree, and gradually envelops it, leading to the host's eventual death. Its roots form a dense network that can strangle the host, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various animals in its ecosystem."
