    "intro": "Epidendrum monophlebium, commonly known as the yellow spider orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, slender pseudobulbs that support its evergreen foliage, which consists of narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers with intricate patterns, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
