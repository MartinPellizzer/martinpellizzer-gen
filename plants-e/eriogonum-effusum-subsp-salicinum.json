It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
