    "intro": "Elaterium gracile var. trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed elaterium, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, narrow leaves that often exhibit a distinct three-lobed shape. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
