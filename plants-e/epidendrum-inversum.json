    "intro": "Epidendrum inversum, commonly known as the Upside-down Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with its flowers facing downward, which is a distinguishing feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
