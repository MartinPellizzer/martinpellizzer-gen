    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 mayebaranus, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Elymus sibiricus and Elymus elongatus. It typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil types, including those that are moderately dry. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its tolerance to grazing. Additionally, it has potential agricultural value as a forage crop."
