    "intro": "Eugenia porphyrantha, commonly known as the purple-leaved eugenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark purple leaves that provide striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by edible berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in warm climates."
