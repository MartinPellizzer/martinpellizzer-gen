    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. chrysocentrus, commonly known as the golden cholla, is a spine-tipped cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branching structure composed of cylindrical stems covered in clusters of bright yellow, tuberculate spines. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne on the areoles. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The golden cholla is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in full sun with minimal water."
