    "intro": "Euphorbia lucida f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a cylindrical stem with a greenish hue and produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic floral structures. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This plant is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
