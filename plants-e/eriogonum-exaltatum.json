    "intro": "Eriogonum exaltatum, commonly known as the tall buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and open woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Eriogonum exaltatum is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like sorrel and buckwheat."
