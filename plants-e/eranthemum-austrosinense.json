    "intro": "Eranthemum austrosinense, commonly known as the southern China geranium, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically produces vibrant pink or red blooms during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Eranthemum austrosinense is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
