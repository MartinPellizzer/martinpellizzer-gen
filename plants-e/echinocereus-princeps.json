    "intro": "Echinocereus princeps, commonly known as the Prince's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with dense clusters of spines and produces showy yellow flowers during the spring. The plant has a ribbed stem that helps it store water, and its spines provide protection from herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and collections."
