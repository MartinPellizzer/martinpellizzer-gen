    "intro": "Euonymus globularis, commonly known as the globe willow or round-leaved euonymus, is a flowering plant species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible for some wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Euonymus globularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
