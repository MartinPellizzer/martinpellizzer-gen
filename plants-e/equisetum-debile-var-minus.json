    "intro": "Equisetum debile var. minus, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a diminutive variety of the horsetail plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Due to its low stature and delicate appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
