    "intro": "Ervum carolinianum, commonly known as Carolina morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
