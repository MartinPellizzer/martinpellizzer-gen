    "intro": "Enalcida pilifera, commonly known as the featherleaf lichen, is a species of foliose lichen characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions. The plant features a pale to dark green upper surface with a distinctive, feathery pattern of lobes. Its lower surface is usually covered with a dense layer of unicellular, hyaline filaments. Enalcida pilifera plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
