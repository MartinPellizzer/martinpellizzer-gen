    "intro": "Endiandra maingayi, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has a dense canopy with lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
