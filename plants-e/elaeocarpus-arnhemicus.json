    "intro": "Elaeocarpus arnhemicus, commonly known as the Arnhem Land holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia, particularly in the Arnhem Land region. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a hard, woody capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for various animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
