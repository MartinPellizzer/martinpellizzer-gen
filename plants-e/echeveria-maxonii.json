    "intro": "Echeveria maxonii, commonly known as the Blue Elf or Blue Moon, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces upright, branched inflorescences with showy, violet to pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
