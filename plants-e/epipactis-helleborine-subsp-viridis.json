    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. viridis, commonly known as the green helleborine, is a perennial orchid that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in calcareous soils. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is adorned with intricate patterns, aiding in pollination by specific insect species. The green helleborine is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to grow in shaded conditions without requiring full sunlight."
