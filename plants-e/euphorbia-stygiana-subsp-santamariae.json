    "intro": "Euphorbia stygiana subsp. santamariae, commonly known as the Santa Maria euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, further adapting it to its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its unique appearance and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
