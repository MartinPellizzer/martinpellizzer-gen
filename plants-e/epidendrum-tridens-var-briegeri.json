    "intro": "Epidendrum tridens var. briegeri, commonly known as the Brieger's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces pendulous racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate for experienced orchid growers."
