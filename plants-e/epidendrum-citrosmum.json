    "intro": "Epidendrum citrosmum, commonly known as the Lemon-scented Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are usually broad and dark green, and it thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Epidendrum citrosmum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
