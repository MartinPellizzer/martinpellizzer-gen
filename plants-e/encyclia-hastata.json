    "intro": "Encyclia hastata, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often dry or seasonally wet habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Encyclia hastata thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
