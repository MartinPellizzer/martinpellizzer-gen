    "intro": "Eriocaulon cladocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. This plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant's flowering structures are usually inconspicuous, with tiny, spikelet-like flowers that are adapted for wind pollination."
