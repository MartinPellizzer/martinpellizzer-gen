    "intro": "Euphorbia hormorrhiza, commonly known as the bloodroot euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces unique, spiky inflorescences called cyathia, which contain small yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts. Its sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution. Euphorbia hormorrhiza is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in rock gardens or xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
