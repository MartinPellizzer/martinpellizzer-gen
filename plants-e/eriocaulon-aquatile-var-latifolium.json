It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that anchors it in shallow water. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale yellow, blooming in the early morning. This variant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
