It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a spiny exterior. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xeriscaping."
