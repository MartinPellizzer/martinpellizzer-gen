    "intro": "Eragrostis bahiensis, commonly known as Bahian grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
