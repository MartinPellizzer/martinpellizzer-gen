    "intro": "Esenbeckia belizensis, commonly known as the Belize esenbeckia, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Belize. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Esenbeckia belizensis is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments within forests."
