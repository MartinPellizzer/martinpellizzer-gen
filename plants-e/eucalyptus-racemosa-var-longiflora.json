    "intro": "Eucalyptus racemosa var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered malletwood, is a medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by woody, cylindrical capsules. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and tableland regions. The species is valued for its timber and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
