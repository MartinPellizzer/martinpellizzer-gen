    "intro": "Echinocarpus, commonly known as the burr cucumber, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive spiny fruits, which are typically spherical or ovoid in shape. The fruit's surface is covered with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Echinocarpus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and have some traditional uses in folk medicine."
