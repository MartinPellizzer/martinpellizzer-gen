    "intro": "Euphorbia olowaluana, commonly known as the Olowalu euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
