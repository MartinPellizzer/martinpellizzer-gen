    "intro": "Eupatorium mohrii, commonly known as Mohr's boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces fluffy, seed-filled capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. Eupatorium mohrii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
