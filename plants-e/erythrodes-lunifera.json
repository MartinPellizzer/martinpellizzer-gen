    "intro": "Erythrodes lunifera, commonly known as the moonflower erythrodes, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close by dawn, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and features thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance that attracts moths and other night-flying pollinators. Erythrodes lunifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming pattern."
