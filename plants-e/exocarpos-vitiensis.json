    "intro": "Exocarpos vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis wax apple, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Vanuatu. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, with a waxy coating that gives it its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or lowland areas with well-drained soil. The species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for cultivation in warmer regions."
