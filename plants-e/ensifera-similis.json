    "intro": "Ensifera similis, commonly known as the leafy fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
