    "intro": "Eupatorium quadrangulare, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its square, often hairy stems and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is usually lance-shaped with a silvery-white underside, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. Eupatorium quadrangulare is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
