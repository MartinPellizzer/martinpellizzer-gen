    "intro": "Exacum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
