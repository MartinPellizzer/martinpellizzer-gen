    "intro": "Ericoides suffultum, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact form and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round coverage. Ericoides suffultum is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
