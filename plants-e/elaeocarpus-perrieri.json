    "intro": "Elaeocarpus perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's elaeocarp, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
