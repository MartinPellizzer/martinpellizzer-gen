    "intro": "Epipactis bugacensis subsp. rhodanensis, commonly known as the Rhodanese helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with brown markings. The plant is terrestrial, growing in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. It produces showy, spurred orchid flowers that are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
