    "intro": "Eupatorium hypericifolium, commonly known as the green dragon, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in wet or moist environments. Eupatorium hypericifolium is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of waterways."
