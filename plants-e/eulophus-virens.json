    "intro": "Eulophus virens, commonly known as the green lacewing, is a small insect that belongs to the family Chrysopidae. It is characterized by its delicate, transparent wings and slender body, which are typically green or yellowish in color. The larvae of Eulophus virens are known as aphid lions due to their predatory behavior toward aphids and other small insects. These insects play an important role in natural pest control in agricultural and garden settings. Their life cycle includes four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult."
