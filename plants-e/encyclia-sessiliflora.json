    "intro": "Encyclia sessiliflora, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange with a darker lip, bloom in summer and are arranged in loose clusters. This orchid thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for tropical moist forests and its ornamental value in horticulture."
