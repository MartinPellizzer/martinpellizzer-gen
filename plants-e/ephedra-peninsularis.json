    "intro": "Ephedra peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the Baja California Peninsula. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by wind. Ephedra peninsularis is part of the Ephedraceae family, which includes other species known for their medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
