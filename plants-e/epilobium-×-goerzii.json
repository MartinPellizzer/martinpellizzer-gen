    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 goerzii, commonly known as the hybrid willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Epilobium \u00d7 goerzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
