    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus subsp. sierrae, commonly known as Sierra needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems, with small, awned florets. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Sierra needlegrass plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
