    "intro": "Eugenia scheffleri, commonly known as the African cherry or yellow-leaf eugenia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by yellowish-red berries, which are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in medicine."
