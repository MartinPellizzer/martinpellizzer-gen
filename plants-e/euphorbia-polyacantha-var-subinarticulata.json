    "intro": "Euphorbia polyacantha var. subinarticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spurge, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping."
