    "intro": "Elaphoglossum denudatum, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum denudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
