It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its stems, which are typically green to reddish in color.

This species is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for wildlife."
