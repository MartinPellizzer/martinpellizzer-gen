    "intro": "Eupatorium serratuloides, commonly known as roughside boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features tall, hairy stems that are often branched and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered with fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clustered inflorescences, blooming from late summer to early fall."
