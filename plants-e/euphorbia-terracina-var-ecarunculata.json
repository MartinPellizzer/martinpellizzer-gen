    "intro": "Euphorbia terracina var. ecarunculata, commonly known as the red-spined spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems that are typically green with red or purple spines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
