    "intro": "Euphorbia plumerioides var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically small and alternate, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. It is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
