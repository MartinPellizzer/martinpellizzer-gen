    "intro": "Endiandra inopinata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is typically found in lowland and hill forests. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. Due to overharvesting, Endiandra inopinata is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
