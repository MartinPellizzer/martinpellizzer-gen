    "intro": "Eucalyptus leptophleba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are usually pale green or yellow, which develop into woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and fire, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem. This species is valued for its ecological role and has been used in horticulture for its ornamental features."
