    "intro": "Eremocrinum albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers with white margins, which are arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Eremocrinum albomarginatum is typically found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
