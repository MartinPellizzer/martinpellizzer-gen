    "intro": "Equisetum funstonii var. ramosum, commonly known as the Funston's horsetail, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces both male and female spore-bearing structures, known as strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The species is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
