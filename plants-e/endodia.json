    "intro": "Endodia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often found growing on trees. The plant produces small, white flowers with a unique, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to epiphytic growth and its role in ecological studies of rare flora."
