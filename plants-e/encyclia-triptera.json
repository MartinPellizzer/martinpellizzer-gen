    "intro": "Encyclia triptera, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean, including parts of Mexico and the Greater Antilles. It is characterized by its compact, often hairy pseudobulbs and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with three prominent lobes, typically in shades of white, yellow, and green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Encyclia triptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
