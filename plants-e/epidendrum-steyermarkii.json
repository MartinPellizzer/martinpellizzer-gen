    "intro": "Epidendrum steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, brightly colored flowers that typically bloom in clusters. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat. Epidendrum steyermarkii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
