    "intro": "Eucalyptus grandis, commonly known as the Sydney blue gum, is a tall, fast-growing evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from white to grey, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and strong, making it valuable for timber and paper production. Eucalyptus grandis is also widely cultivated for its essential oils, which have medicinal and industrial applications."
