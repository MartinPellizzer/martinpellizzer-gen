    "intro": "Epidendrum sarcodes, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive pink or red coloration. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role within tropical ecosystems and its ornamental value in horticulture."
