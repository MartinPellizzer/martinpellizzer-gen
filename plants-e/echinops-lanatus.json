    "intro": "Echinops lanatus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads composed of dense, white to pale blue bracts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the development of dry, woody fruits. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, and the plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils. Echinops lanatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
