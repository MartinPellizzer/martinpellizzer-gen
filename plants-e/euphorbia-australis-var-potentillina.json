    "intro": "Euphorbia australis var. potentillina, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate salt spray make it a resilient addition to coastal ecosystems."
