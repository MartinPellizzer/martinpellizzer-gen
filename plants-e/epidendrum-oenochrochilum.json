    "intro": "Epidendrum oenochrochilum, commonly known as the yellow-lipped epidendrum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange lip, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers. Epidendrum oenochrochilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
