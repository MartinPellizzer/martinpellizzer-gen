    "intro": "Eleocharis multiflora, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense clumps with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, emerging from spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Eleocharis multiflora plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
