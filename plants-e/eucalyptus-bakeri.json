    "intro": "Eucalyptus bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a distinctive white underside. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora."
