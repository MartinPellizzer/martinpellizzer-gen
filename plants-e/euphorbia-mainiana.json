    "intro": "Euphorbia mainiana, commonly known as the Main Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for dry environments. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
