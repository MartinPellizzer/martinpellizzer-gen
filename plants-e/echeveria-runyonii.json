    "intro": "Echeveria runyonii, commonly known as the Runyon's Echeveria, is a succulent native to the rocky regions of the southwestern United States. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on tall, branching stalks. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
