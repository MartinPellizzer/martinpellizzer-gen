    "intro": "Euphorbia zeylana, commonly known as the Zeylanic spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its stems for survival. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
