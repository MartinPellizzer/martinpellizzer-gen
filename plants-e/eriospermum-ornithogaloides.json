    "intro": "Eriospermum ornithogaloides, commonly known as the mountain globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive globular inflorescence, which consists of tightly packed, showy yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
