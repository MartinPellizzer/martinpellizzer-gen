    "intro": "Espeletia tenorae, commonly known as the \"P\u00e1ramo Giant,\" is a striking plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, rosette-forming leaves that are covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps it retain moisture in the cold, high-altitude environment. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Espeletia tenorae is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can withstand strong winds and intense UV radiation. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the biodiversity of the Andean region."
