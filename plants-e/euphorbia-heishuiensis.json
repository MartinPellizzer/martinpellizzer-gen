It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Due to its rarity and specific habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
