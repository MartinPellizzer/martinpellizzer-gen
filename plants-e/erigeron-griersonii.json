    "intro": "Erigeron griersonii, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it has adapted to survive with minimal water. Its hairy leaves and compact growth form help reduce water loss, making it well-suited to harsh conditions. The small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
