    "intro": "Epirixanthes elongata f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered elongated epirixanthe, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that are predominantly white in color, contrasting with the green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
