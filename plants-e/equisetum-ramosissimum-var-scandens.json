    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. scandens, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living seedless vascular plants."
