    "intro": "Ecbolium ligustrinum var. ligustrinum, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, heart-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves contain compounds that give it a distinctive vanilla-like scent, which has been historically used in perfumes and as a flavoring agent. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a beneficial addition to certain garden ecosystems."
