    "intro": "Elymus distichus, commonly known as the two-row bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two rows of small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Elymus distichus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in natural landscapes."
