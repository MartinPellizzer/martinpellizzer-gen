    "intro": "Epidendrum modestiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a loose inflorescence. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Epidendrum modestiflorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
