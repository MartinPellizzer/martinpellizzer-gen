    "intro": "Euphorbia petiolata, commonly known as the paddle cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Euphorbia petiolata is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
