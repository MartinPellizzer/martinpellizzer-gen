    "intro": "Euphorbia abyssinica var. mozambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique spurge, is a succulent plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
