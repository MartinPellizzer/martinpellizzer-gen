    "intro": "Echinocactus heyderi, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that is covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
