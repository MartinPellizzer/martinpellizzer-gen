    "intro": "Elymus semicostatus subsp. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. Thomson's needlegrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
