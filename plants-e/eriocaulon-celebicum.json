    "intro": "Eriocaulon celebicum, commonly known as the Celebes spikerush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in waterlogged soils. Its small, white flowers are clustered in elongated spikes, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriocaulon celebicum plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
