    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. genuina, commonly known as leafy spurges, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant has alternate, simple, and often lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. It is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of North America."
