    "intro": "Epidendrum orthopterum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Holy Spirit, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive spurred lip. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Epidendrum orthopterum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
