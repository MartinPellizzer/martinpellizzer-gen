    "intro": "Elymus villiflorus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and for its potential use in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
