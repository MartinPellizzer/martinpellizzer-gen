    "intro": "Erigeron peregrinus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to arid environments, reducing water loss. The showy blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
