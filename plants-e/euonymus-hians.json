    "intro": "Euonymus hians, commonly known as the Chinese burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning from green to brilliant red during autumn. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
