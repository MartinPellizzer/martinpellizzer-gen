    "intro": "Erica dolfiana, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a flowering shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the winter months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Erica dolfiana thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
