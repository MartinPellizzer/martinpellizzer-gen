    "intro": "Encelia resinifera, commonly known as the resinous encelia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, which gives it its common name and has been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Encelia resinifera is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system to access groundwater."
