    "intro": "Ephedrides trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Ephedrides trifurcata is part of the Ephedraceae family, which includes other species known for their medicinal properties. Its growth form and distribution make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
