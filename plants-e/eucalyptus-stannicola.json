    "intro": "Eucalyptus stannicola, commonly known as the Stannicola mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pink, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Eucalyptus stannicola is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays an important role in its native ecosystem."
