    "intro": "Epidendrum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum latifolium is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
