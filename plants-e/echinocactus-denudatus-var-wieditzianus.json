It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered with a layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
