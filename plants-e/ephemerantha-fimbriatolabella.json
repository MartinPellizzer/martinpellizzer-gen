    "intro": "Ephemerantha fimbriatolabella, commonly known as the lace-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, intricately veined leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, requiring well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
