    "intro": "Entomophobia, commonly known as the fear of insects, is not a plant but a specific phobia. It is a psychological condition rather than a botanical term. The term itself does not refer to any plant species or botanical characteristics. However, it may be confused with the scientific name of certain plants that have insect-related properties. This phobia is unrelated to the study of plants or botanical science."
