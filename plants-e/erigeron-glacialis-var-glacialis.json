    "intro": "Erigeron glacialis var. glacialis, commonly known as the glacierweed, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
