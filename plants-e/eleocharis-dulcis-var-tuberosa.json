It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and shallow water bodies, often forming dense vegetation. The plant has slender, leafless stems that float on the water surface, with small, spike-like inflorescences. Its tubers are the economically important part, used as a vegetable in various cuisines. The plant plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic life."
