    "intro": "Echinocactus huotii, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a spiny, columnar cactus with a distinctive globular shape and a thick, ribbed trunk. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. Echinocactus huotii is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal watering once established."
