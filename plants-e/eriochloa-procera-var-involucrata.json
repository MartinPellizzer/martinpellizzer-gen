    "intro": "Eriochloa procera var. involucrata, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils effectively. This variety is often found in wetland areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
