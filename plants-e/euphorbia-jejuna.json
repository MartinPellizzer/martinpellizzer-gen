    "intro": "Euphorbia jejuna, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia jejuna is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
