    "intro": "Eutrema halophilum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is native to coastal and arid regions of Australia. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss and tolerate high salt concentrations. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and it produces small, dry fruits. Eutrema halophilum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in salty conditions."
