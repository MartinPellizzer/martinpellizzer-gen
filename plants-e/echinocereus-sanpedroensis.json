    "intro": "Echinocereus sanpedroensis, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, often adorned with spines and areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically funnel-shaped and attract pollinators such as bees and bats. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its adaptations, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and can be cultivated in regions with similar climates."
