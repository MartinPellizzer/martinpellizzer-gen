    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. triquetrum, commonly known as the triquetrous field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves and a hollow, segmented stem. This variety is distinguished by its triangular cross-section, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, with the fertile stems producing sporangia at the nodes."
