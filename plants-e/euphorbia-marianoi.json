    "intro": "Euphorbia marianoi, commonly known as the Marian's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
