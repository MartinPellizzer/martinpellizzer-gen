It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
