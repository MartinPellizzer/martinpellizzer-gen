    "intro": "Erysimastrum gelidum, commonly known as the alpine frostweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. This perennial herb thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
