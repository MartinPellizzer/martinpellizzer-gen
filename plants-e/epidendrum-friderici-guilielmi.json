    "intro": "Epidendrum friderici-guilielmi, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom during the holiday season. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to cling to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
