    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine var. laxiflora, commonly known as the looseflower helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its unique inflorescence of greenish-yellow to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers have a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. The varietal form laxiflora is distinguished by its more loosely arranged flowers compared to the typical variety."
