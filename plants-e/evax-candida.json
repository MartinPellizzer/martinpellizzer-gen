    "intro": "Evax candida, commonly known as the white-flowered evax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge. Evax candida is often found in meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
