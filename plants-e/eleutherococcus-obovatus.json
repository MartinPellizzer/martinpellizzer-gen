    "intro": "Eleutherococcus obovatus, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, obovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. The roots and stems are used in traditional medicine for their purported adaptogenic properties."
