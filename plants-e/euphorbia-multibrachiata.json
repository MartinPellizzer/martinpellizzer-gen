    "intro": "Euphorbia multibrachiata, commonly known as the branched spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its branching stems and fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. Euphorbia multibrachiata is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
