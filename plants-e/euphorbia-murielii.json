    "intro": "Euphorbia murielii, commonly known as the Muriel's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with smooth, waxy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
