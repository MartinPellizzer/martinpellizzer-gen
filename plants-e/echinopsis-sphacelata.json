    "intro": "Echinopsis sphacelata, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its striking, bright-colored flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from the surface soil. Echinopsis sphacelata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
