    "intro": "Equisetum scirpoides var. ramulosum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its morphology reflects its ancient lineage, with features reminiscent of early vascular plants."
