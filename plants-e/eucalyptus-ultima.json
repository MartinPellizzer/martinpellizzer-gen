    "intro": "Eucalyptus ultima, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia, specifically the southern regions, where it grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrubs with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Eucalyptus ultima produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
