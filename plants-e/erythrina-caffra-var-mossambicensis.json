    "intro": "Erythrina caffra var. mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique coral tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright red, flame-like flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. The plant has compound leaves with three leaflets, and its distinctive, branching habit makes it a striking ornamental species. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and it is often used in landscaping for its vibrant floral display. The Mozambique coral tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
