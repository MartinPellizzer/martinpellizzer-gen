    "intro": "Eugenia radiciflora, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and reddish, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. The plant has specialized roots called pneumatophores that help it absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, playing a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pink, and attract various pollinators."
