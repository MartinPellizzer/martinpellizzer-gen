    "intro": "Eumachia nana, commonly known as the dwarf eumachia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. Eumachia nana thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various arctic wildlife species."
