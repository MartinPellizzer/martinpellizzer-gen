    "intro": "Erigeron rivularis, commonly known as the streamweed or riverblue, is a flowering plant native to wetland and streamside habitats in North America. It is a perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged alternately along the stem. Erigeron rivularis is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing stream banks through its extensive root system."
