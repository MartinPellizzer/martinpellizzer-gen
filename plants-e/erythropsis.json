    "intro": "Erythropsis, commonly known as the red-leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red or purple foliage, which is often more pronounced in certain species. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Erythropsis species are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in the Cape Province. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking leaf coloration."
