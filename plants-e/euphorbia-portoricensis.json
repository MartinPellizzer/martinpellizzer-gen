    "intro": "Euphorbia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces a unique, yellowish-green flower cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Euphorbia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
