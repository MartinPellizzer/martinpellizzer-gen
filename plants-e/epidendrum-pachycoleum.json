    "intro": "Epidendrum pachycoleum, commonly known as the thick-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to dry environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
