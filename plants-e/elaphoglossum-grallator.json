    "intro": "Elaphoglossum grallator, commonly known as the creeping holly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on forest floors or among leaf litter. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum grallator is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
