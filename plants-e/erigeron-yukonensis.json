    "intro": "Erigeron yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon Fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as tundra, gravelly soils, and rocky areas. The plant features a basal rosette of silvery-gray, hairy leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disc florets. It blooms in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Yukon Fleabane is adapted to cold climates and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
