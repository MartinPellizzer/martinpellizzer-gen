    "intro": "Elaphoglossum furcatum, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain environmental conditions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a distinctive forked shape at the base. Elaphoglossum furcatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
