    "intro": "Echinocactus brevihamatus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in clusters of bright green, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, apple-like fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
