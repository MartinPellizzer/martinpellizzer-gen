    "intro": "Eupatorium chachapoyense, commonly known as the Chachapoyas eupatorium, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
