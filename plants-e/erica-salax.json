    "intro": "Erica salax, commonly known as the lax heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica salax is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland fynbos vegetation."
