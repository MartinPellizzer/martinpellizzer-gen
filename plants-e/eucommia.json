    "intro": "Eucommia, commonly known as the Chinese rubber tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Ebenaceae and is characterized by its thick, bark-like trunk that can become quite large over time. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a milky sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are large, glossy, and heart-shaped, contributing to its ornamental value. Eucommia is also valued for its role in the production of natural rubber."
