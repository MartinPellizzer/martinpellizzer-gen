    "intro": "Endlicheria racemosa, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters along the branches. Its flowers are typically pollinated by birds and insects, and the plant is adapted to high-altitude environments. Endlicheria racemosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
