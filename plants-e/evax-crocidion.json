    "intro": "Evax crocidion, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like foliage and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly environments. Its fleshy leaves help it store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
