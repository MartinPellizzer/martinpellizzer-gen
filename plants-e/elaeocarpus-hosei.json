It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that are typically clustered in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for its potential ecological and medicinal values."
