    "intro": "Erigeron pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf fleabane, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow central disk. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
