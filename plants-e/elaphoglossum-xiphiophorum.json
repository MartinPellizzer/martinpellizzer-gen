    "intro": "Elaphoglossum xiphiophorum, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded rock crevices and forest understories. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited habitat and threats from invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
