    "intro": "Euphorbia neoerubescens, commonly known as the red-spotted euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in bright red and yellow spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow\u82b1\u6735 that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
