    "intro": "Equisetum pratense var. pyramidale, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scouring rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, needle-like structures, and it is often found in wet meadows or along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth form compared to other equisetum species."
