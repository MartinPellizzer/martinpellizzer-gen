    "intro": "Eucalyptus caleyi, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that ranges from grey to brown in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish or greyish hue, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically pale yellow to cream in color, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is well adapted to drought and is often found in open woodlands and shrublands."
