    "intro": "Eragrostis congesta var. penicillata, commonly known as the dense bluestem grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It features tufted, dense clusters of narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
