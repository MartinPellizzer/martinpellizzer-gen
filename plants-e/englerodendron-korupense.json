    "intro": "Englerodendron korupense, commonly known as the Korup ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage, which contributes to its ecological significance. The plant exhibits a complex root system that helps stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in axillary clusters, and it produces woody pods containing seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological value, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
