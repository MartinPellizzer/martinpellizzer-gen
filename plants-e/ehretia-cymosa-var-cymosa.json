    "intro": "Ehretia cymosa var. cymosa, commonly known as the clustered ehretia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in cymes, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
