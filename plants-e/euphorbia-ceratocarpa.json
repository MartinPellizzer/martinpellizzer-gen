    "intro": "Euphorbia ceratocarpa, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive, spiny stem with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flowers typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its bark is rough and often cracked, and it can grow as a shrub or a tree-like structure. Euphorbia ceratocarpa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
