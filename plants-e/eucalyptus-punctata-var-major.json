    "intro": "Eucalyptus punctata var. major, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green underside. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
