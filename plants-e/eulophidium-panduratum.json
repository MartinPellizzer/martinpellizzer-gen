It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
