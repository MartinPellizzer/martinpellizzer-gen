    "intro": "Eucephalus bicolor, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink, with a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows in prairies and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces a tall, spiky cone of seeds at the center of the flower. Eucephalus bicolor is a valuable plant for pollinators and is often used in native plant gardens."
