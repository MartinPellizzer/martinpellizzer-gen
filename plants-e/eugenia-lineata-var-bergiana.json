    "intro": "Eugenia lineata var. bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian guava, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. These flowers give way to small, round, pinkish-red fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
