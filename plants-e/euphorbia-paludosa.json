    "intro": "Euphorbia paludosa, commonly known as swamp spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Euphorbia paludosa is noted for its resilience to waterlogged conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
