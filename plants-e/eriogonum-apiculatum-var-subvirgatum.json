    "intro": "Eriogonum apiculatum var. subvirgatum, commonly known as the Sierra sacaton, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, glandular leaves and showy, spikelike clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and grasslands. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
