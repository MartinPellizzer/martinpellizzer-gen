    "intro": "Elymus himalayanus, commonly known as Himalayan wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical arrangements. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Elymus himalayanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
