    "intro": "Echinacea atrorubens, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking purple to reddish-pink petals and a prominent, spiky central cone. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and used in traditional medicine. Echinacea atrorubens is well adapted to prairie and woodland environments, often found in well-drained soils."
