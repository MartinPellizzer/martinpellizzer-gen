    "intro": "Erythroxylum distortum var. paraguariense, commonly known as the Paraguayan coca, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is notable for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids, particularly cocaine. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local cultures."
