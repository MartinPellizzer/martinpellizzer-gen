Engelia species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, dry conditions. They have small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, and their flowers often display vibrant colors to attract pollinators. The genus includes several species, each with unique morphological features and ecological roles in their native habitats."
