    "intro": "Eriocoma hartwegiana, commonly known as the Hartweg's eriocoma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
