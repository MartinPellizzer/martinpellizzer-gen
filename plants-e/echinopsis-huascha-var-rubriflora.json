    "intro": "Echinopsis huascha var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to gray spines and produces striking red flowers that open at night. The plant is part of the Cactaceae family and is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among cactus enthusiasts."
