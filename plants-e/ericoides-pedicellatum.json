    "intro": "Ericoides pedicellatum, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides pedicellatum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and rocky slopes. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
