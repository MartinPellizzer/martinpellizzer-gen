It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Eriosema terniflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
