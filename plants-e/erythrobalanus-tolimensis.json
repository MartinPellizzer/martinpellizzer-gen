    "intro": "Erythrobalanus tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima bloodwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,200 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
