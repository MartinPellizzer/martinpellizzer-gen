    "intro": "Elytrigia geniculata subsp. ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and fine, tufted leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a stabilizer of soil in degraded areas and as a forage plant for grazing animals."
