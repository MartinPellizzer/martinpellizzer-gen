    "intro": "Eleocharis andina, commonly known as Andean spikegrass, is a species of sedge native to the high Andes of South America. It typically grows in moist, mountainous environments, often in wetlands or along streams at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its structural strength. Eleocharis andina is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
