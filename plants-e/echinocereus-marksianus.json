    "intro": "Echinocereus marksianus, commonly known as the Mark's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits known as tunas. The species is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
