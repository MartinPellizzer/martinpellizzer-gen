    "intro": "Euryblema, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Euryblema species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. They are carnivorous, supplementing their nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey. The leaves are usually narrow and floating, adapted for life in water."
