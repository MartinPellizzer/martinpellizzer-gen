    "intro": "Eurylepis diosmifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
