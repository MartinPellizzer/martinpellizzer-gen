    "intro": "Elaphandra lehmannii, commonly known as the Mahogany tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions."
