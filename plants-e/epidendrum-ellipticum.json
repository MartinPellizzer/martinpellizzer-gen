    "intro": "Epidendrum ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in summer and are often pollinated by bees and other insects. Epidendrum ellipticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment."
