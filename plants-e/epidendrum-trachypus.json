    "intro": "Epidendrum trachypus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Epidendrum trachypus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
