    "intro": "Epidendrum crispatum, commonly known as the curly lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescences and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum crispatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
