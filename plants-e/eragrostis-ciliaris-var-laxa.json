It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, giving it a feathery appearance. This variety is characterized by its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
