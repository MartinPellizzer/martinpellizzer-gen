    "intro": "Eupatorium intermedium var. glabrescens, commonly known as white boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features upright stems that are often hairy when young but become smooth as they mature. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive white or grayish underside."
