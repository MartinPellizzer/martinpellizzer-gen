    "intro": "Eleocharis mucronulata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various water conditions."
