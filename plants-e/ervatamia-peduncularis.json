    "intro": "Ervatamia peduncularis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial with narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Ervatamia peduncularis is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
