    "intro": "Espeletia annemariana, commonly known as the Annemaria's espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy foliage. The plant is typically found in high-altitude grasslands and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in its harsh environment. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are small and yellow, contributing to its role in local pollination networks."
