    "intro": "Eucalyptus reducta, commonly known as the red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from grey to reddish-brown. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a distinctive white or greyish underside. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically pale blue or white, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
