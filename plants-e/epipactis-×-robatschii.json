    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 robatschii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh helleborine, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and bogs. The plant features a rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is a natural hybrid between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations and is often found in regions where its parent species overlap."
