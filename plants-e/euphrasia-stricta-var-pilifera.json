    "intro": "Euphrasia stricta var. pilifera, commonly known as the hairy toothwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it has hairy stems and leaves. Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on host plants for nutrients, often found growing in association with grasses and sedges."
