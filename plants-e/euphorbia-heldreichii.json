    "intro": "Euphorbia heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula. It features succulent, gray-green leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking yellow cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to high altitudes, making it a resilient species in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
