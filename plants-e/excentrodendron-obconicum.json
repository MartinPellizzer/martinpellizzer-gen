    "intro": "Excentrodendron obconicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a woody plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
