    "intro": "Eragrostis thalassica, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of the United States and other regions with saline soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, adapted to thrive in salty and well-drained environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its deep root system helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Eragrostis thalassica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of harsh, saline conditions."
