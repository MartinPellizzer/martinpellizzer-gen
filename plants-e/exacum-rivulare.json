    "intro": "Exacum rivulare, commonly known as the water primrose, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features bright green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in moist environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful aquatic plant and a potential invasive species."
