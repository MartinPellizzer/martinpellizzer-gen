    "intro": "Elettaria rubida, commonly known as red cardamom, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, spindle-shaped seed pods. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by the distinctive red, hairy capsules containing the aromatic seeds. The seeds are harvested when the capsules turn red and are widely used in cooking and traditional medicine for their spicy, sweet flavor. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both horticulture and culinary applications."
