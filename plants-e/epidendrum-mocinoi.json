    "intro": "Epidendrum mocinoi, commonly known as the Mocino's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant. Epidendrum mocinoi is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and consistent moisture."
