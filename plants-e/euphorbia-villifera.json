    "intro": "Euphorbia villifera, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are modified leaf-like structures. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Euphorbia villifera is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
