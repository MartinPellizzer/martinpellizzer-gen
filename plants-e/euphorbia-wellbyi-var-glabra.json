    "intro": "Euphorbia wellbyi var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It features a short, thick stem with sparse, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in dry environments by storing water in its stem and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
