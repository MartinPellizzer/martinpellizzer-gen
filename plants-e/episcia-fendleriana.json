    "intro": "Episcia fendleriana, commonly known as the silver star plant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Episcia fendleriana is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
