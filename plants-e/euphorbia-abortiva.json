    "intro": "Euphorbia abortiva, commonly known as the aborted spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces toxic latex when damaged, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Euphorbia abortiva is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties, though its use requires caution due to its toxic compounds."
