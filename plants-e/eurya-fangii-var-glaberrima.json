It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
