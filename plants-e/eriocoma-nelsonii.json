    "intro": "Eriocoma nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's eriocoma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The flowers bloom in the spring, producing small yellow to orange composite blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
