    "intro": "Echinocactus orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico. It is a slow-growing, columnar cactus with a ribbed, cylindrical stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the top of the stem. Its spines are typically light yellow to brown, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. Echinocactus orcuttii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem and having a deep root system to access groundwater."
