    "intro": "Eugenia schuechiana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Eugenia schuechiana*, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries, though they are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ecological value."
