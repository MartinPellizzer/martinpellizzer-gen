    "intro": "Eulophia sanguinea, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its striking, often red or purple-pink inflorescences that resemble blood droplets, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are borne on long, slender spikes and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Eulophia sanguinea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
