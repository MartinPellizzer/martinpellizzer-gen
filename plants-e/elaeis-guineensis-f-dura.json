    "intro": "Elaeis guineensis f. dura, commonly known as the hard-palm variant of the oil palm, is a botanical form characterized by its robust and dense fruit structure. This variant is notable for its thick, durable rachis, which makes it more resistant to mechanical damage during harvesting. The plant exhibits typical oil palm morphology, with large, fan-shaped leaves and clustered fruiting structures. It is primarily cultivated for its high oil yield and is often used in industrial applications. Due to its hardiness, it is favored in regions with challenging environmental conditions."
