    "intro": "Echinocactus sandillon, commonly known as the Sandillon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense covering of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Due to its unique features, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
