    "intro": "Epiamomum roseisquamosum, commonly known as the rose-squamate epiamomum, is a rare and little-studied plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology. The plant features prominently veined, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive rose-colored underside. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically have a pinkish hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
