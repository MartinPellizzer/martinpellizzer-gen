    "intro": "Epidendrum microanoglossum, commonly known as the miniature lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and striking, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant prefers warm, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in periods of drought. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
