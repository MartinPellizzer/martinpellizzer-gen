    "intro": "Elymus engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure. Elymus engelmannii is well adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
