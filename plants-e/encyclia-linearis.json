    "intro": "Encyclia linearis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces fragrant, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Encyclia linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
