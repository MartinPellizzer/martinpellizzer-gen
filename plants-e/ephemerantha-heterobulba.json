    "intro": "Ephemerantha heterobulba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. It has a unique root system composed of aerial roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered."
