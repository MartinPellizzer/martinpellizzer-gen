    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ophioglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a compact appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
