    "intro": "Epiphyllanthus candidus, commonly known as the white fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives on the surfaces of trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its leaves are broad and feathery, with a pale green coloration that helps it blend into its canopy environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in its natural range."
