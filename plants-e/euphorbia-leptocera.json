    "intro": "Euphorbia leptocera, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a caustic plant to handle. Euphorbia leptocera typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
