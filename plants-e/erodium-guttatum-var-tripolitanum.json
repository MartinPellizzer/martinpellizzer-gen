    "intro": "Erodium guttatum var. tripolitanum, commonly known as the Tripolitan stormweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and covered in a sticky substance, which aids in their dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
