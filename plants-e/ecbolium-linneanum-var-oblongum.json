It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge, often tinged with a pale underside. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters during the spring and are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits.
