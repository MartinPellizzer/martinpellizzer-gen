    "intro": "Echinacanthus lyallianus, commonly known as the Lyall's spurge, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and striking yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. The species is also notable for its toxic sap, which contains irritants that can cause skin reactions in humans."
