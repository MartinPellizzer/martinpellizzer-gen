    "intro": "Eryngium ebracteatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eryngium ebracteatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a source of nectar for pollinators."
