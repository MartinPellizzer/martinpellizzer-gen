    "intro": "Epatitis, commonly known as liver inflammation, is not a plant but a medical condition affecting the liver. It is not related to botanical studies or plant biology. The term \"epatitis\" originates from the Greek words \"epi\" (upon) and \"hepar\" (liver). It is often caused by viral infections, such as hepatitis A, B, or C. Understanding the botanical aspects of this condition is not applicable, as it pertains to human health rather than plant life."
