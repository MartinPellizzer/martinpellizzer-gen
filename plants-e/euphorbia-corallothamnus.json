    "intro": "Euphorbia corallothamnus, commonly known as the coral bush, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, branching stems covered in small, spiny tubercles, giving it a distinctive coral-like appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Euphorbia corallothamnus is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
