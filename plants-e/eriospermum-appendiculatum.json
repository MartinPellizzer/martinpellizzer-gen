It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland fynbos regions. Eriospermum appendiculatum is adapted to dry conditions and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
