    "intro": "Ecbolium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadowbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It possesses broad, velvety leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions, allowing it to thrive in dim environments. The plant produces striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow at night, aiding in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its root system is highly specialized, enabling it to absorb nutrients from nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat destruction, Ecbolium umbrosum is now classified as an endangered species."
