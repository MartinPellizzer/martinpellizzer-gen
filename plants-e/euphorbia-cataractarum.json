    "intro": "Euphorbia cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfall spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that resemble cascading waterfalls, hence its common name. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Euphorbia cataractarum is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in dry conditions."
