    "intro": "Epidendrum perijaense, commonly known as the Perijan Orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Venezuela and Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features dense, dark green leaves and produces strikingly colorful, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple. Its inflorescence is typically terminal, with multiple blooms that can last for several weeks. Epidendrum perijaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
