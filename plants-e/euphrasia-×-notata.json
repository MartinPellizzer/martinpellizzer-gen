    "intro": "Euphrasia \u00d7 notata, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a hybrid species within the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to parts of North America and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in spikes. Euphrasia \u00d7 notata is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures."
