    "intro": "Eschweilera antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian wax palm, is a species of palm native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, misty conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some conservation areas."
