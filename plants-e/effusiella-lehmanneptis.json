    "intro": "Effusiella lehmanneptis, commonly known as the Lehman's effusiella, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
