    "intro": "Euphorbia hondurana, commonly known as the Honduras spurge, is a succulent plant native to Central America. It features a distinctive stem with a smooth, waxy surface and produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures. The plant has a rosette growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
