    "intro": "Eubotryoides grayana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved grayana, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
