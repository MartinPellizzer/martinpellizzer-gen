    "intro": "Echites cuspidatus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warm season, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. Echites cuspidatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and fiber."
