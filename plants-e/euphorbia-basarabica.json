    "intro": "Euphorbia basarabica, commonly known as the Basarabica spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its milky sap, which can be irritating, it is important to handle the plant with care."
