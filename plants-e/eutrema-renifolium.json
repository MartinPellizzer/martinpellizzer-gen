It is a herbaceous perennial with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Eutrema renifolium is often found in dry washes, plains, and other xeric habitats."
