    "intro": "Epidendrum wayqechaense, commonly known as the Wayqecha orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of the Andes in Peru. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive greenish-yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native high-altitude environment. Epidendrum wayqechaense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique ecological adaptations."
