    "intro": "Euphorbia polycephala, commonly known as the \"Cape Town spurge,\" is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Euphorbia polycephala is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
