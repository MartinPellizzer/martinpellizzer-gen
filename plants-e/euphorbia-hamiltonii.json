    "intro": "Euphorbia hamiltonii, commonly known as the Hamilton's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in small, spiny structures called tubercles. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
