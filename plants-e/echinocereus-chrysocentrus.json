    "intro": "Echinocereus chrysocentrus, commonly known as the golden cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a spineless, branching plant with cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of whitish, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
