It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of Vietnam and China. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
