    "intro": "Eriophorum maximowiczii, commonly known as the tundra cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the ends of its flowering stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, contributing to the floral diversity of its cold climate habitat."
