    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata var. rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically red or purple in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
