    "intro": "Epipactis fumata, commonly known as the smoky helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy flowers that are typically greenish-brown with a yellowish lip. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, often with a sweet, vanilla-like scent. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil in its natural habitat."
