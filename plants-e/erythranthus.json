    "intro": "Erythranthus, commonly known as the fireweed or redstem, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their hairy stems and showy, often blue or purple flowers. They are typically found in moist, rocky or alpine environments across the Northern Hemisphere. Erythranthus species are perennial herbs that often form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Their botanical features make them important in ecological and horticultural contexts."
