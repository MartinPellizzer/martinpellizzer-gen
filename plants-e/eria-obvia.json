    "intro": "Eria obvia, commonly known as the common ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, strap-like leaves and produces flowers in clusters, often during the rainy season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Eria obvia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
