    "intro": "Epilobium tarni, commonly known as the tarn bilberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of bright red berries. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that consume its berries. Epilobium tarni is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
