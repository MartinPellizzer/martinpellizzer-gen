It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its bark and wood are valued for their aromatic properties and have been used in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting, Erythraea turneri is now considered an endangered species."
