    "intro": "Euphorbia calyculata, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking succulent plant native to South Africa. It features tall, spiky inflorescences that resemble candles, with bright orange to red bracts that attract pollinators. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Euphorbia calyculata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
