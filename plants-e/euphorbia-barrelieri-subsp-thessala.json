    "intro": "Euphorbia barrelieri subsp. thessala, commonly known as the Thessalian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of yellowish-green, cup-like structures called cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are usually covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
