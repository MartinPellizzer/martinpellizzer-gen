It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
