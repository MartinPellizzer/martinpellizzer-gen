    "intro": "Equilabium dolomiticum, commonly known as the dolomitic labium, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alkaline soil environments. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes showy, bilaterally symmetrical petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often in mountainous or limestone regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
