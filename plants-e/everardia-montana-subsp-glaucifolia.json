It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive blue-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
