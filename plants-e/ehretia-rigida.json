    "intro": "Ehretia rigida, commonly known as the rigid ehretia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It features simple, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ehretia rigida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils with partial shade."
