    "intro": "Eugenia myrcioides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, red or purple berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
