    "intro": "Eugenia capparidifolia var. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves with long petioles, which distinguish it from other varieties of Eugenia. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
