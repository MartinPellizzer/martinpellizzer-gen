    "intro": "Elaphoglossum apodum var. latum, commonly known as the broad-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sori, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden settings."
