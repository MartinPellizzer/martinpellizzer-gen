    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. condensata, commonly known as the condensed helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers have a unique structure with a spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth form and denser flower arrangement compared to other members of the species."
