    "intro": "Ethnora, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer under sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Ethnora is known for its unique ability to absorb and store moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its potential medicinal properties."
