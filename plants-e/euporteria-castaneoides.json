    "intro": "Euporteria castaneoides, commonly known as the horse chestnut leaf gall midge, is a species of gall midge in the family Cecidomyiidae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it primarily infests the leaves of horse chestnut trees (Aesculus species). The larvae of this insect induce the formation of distinctive galls on the leaves, which provide both protection and nutrients. These galls are typically spherical or elongated and can vary in color from green to red or brown depending on the stage of development. The plant's interaction with this insect highlights the complex relationships between plants and their herbivorous invertebrate associates."
