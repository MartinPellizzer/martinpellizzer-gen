    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 somboriensis, commonly known as the Som\u0431\u043e\u0440 hybrid spurge, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Euphorbia characias and Euphorbia palustris. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, woolly leaves. The plant produces striking yellow-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
