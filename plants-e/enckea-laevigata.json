    "intro": "Enckea laevigata, commonly known as the silky tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
