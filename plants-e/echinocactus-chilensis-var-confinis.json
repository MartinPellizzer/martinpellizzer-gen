    "intro": "Echinocactus chilensis var. confinis, commonly known as the Santa Cruz prickly pear, is a cactus native to coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
