    "intro": "Eucalyptus phoenicea, commonly known as the silver bottle tree, is a tall, slender tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue, and they are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
