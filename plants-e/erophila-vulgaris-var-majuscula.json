    "intro": "Erophila vulgaris var. majuscula, commonly known as the greater watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and canals. Its small, white flowers appear in summer and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Erophila vulgaris var. majuscula is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats that can alter aquatic ecosystems."
