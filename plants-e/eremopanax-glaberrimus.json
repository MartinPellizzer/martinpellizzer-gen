It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinct aromatic scent that attracts pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Eremopanax glaberrimus is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
