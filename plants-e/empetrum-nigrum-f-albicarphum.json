    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum f. albicarphum, commonly known as the white-fruited crowberry, is a variant of the common crowberry. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and distinctive white or pale pink berries. The plant typically thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it produces berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. This form is notable for its unique fruit coloration, which sets it apart from the typical black berries of the species."
