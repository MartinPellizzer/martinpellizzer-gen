    "intro": "Elaeagnus angustifolia var. turcica, commonly known as Turkish silverberry, is a shrub native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its silvery foliage, which results from dense, fine pubescence on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
