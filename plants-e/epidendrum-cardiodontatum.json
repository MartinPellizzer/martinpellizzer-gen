    "intro": "Epidendrum cardiodontatum, commonly known as the heart-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green markings. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum cardiodontatum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
