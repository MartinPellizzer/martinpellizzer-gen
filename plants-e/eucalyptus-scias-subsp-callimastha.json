    "intro": "Eucalyptus scias subsp. callimastha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color and have a rough, fissured texture. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are typically pale yellow or green, which open to reveal white or cream flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is known for its aromatic oils, which contribute to its use in traditional and modern applications."
