    "intro": "Euphorbia heldreichii var. roeseri, commonly known as the Balkan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
