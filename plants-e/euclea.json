    "intro": "Euclea, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in southern Africa, with some extending into tropical regions of Asia. The plants are characterized by their hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. Euclea species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. They are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are well adapted to arid conditions."
