    "intro": "Euphorbia verrucitesta, commonly known as the rough-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, waxy stems covered in small, bumpy protrusions that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stems for survival in arid conditions. Euphorbia verrucitesta is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
