    "intro": "Eucalyptus flavida, commonly known as the yellow box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that often displays a yellowish hue, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a grey-green upper surface and a white underside. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from yellow to white, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
