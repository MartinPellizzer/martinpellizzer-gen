    "intro": "Elaphoglossum asterolepis, commonly known as the star-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a star-like pattern of small, clustered pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Elaphoglossum asterolepis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
