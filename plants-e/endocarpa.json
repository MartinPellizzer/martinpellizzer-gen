    "intro": "Endocarpa, commonly known as the innermost layer of the fruit's pericarp, is a critical botanical structure in many plants. It is typically composed of parenchyma cells and often contains the seeds. The endocarp can be fleshy, woody, or stony, depending on the species. In some fruits, such as peaches, it forms a hard, protective covering around the seeds. This layer plays a vital role in seed dispersal and protection."
