    "intro": "Eriocaulon dembianense, commonly known as the Dembien sedge, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and wetlands. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
