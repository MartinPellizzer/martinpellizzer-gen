    "intro": "Eragrostis angolensis, commonly known as Angola lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eragrostis angolensis is adapted to low-nutrient soils and is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system."
