    "intro": "Elaphoglossum macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the margins of the fertile fronds. Elaphoglossum macgregorii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates."
