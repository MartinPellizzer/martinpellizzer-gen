    "intro": "Epipactis thesaurensis, commonly known as the Thessalian helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a pale yellow to greenish flower with a contrasting dark purple or brown lip. Epipactis thesaurensis is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological niche in forest ecosystems."
