    "intro": "Euphorbia franckiana, commonly known as the Franck's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia franckiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
