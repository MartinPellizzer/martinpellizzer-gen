    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. multiflorus, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and erosion control capabilities. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
