    "intro": "Erodium melanostigma var. thalictroides, commonly known as the yellow weed or thalictroides erodium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals, and are often mistaken for those of the genus Thalictrum. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and grasslands."
