It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Epidendrum pseudavicula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
