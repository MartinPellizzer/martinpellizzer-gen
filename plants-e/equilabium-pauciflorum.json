    "intro": "Equilabium pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare flowering plant of the Ericaceae family, is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. It typically produces pale pink to white blooms during the late spring to early summer season. The plant has evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that provide a dense canopy. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
