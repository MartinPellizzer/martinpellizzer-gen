    "intro": "Erophila charbonnelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, aromatic leaves with a slightly serrated edge and produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in spikes. Its flowering period generally occurs during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Erophila charbonnelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
