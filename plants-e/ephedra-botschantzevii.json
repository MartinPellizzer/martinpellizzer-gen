    "intro": "Ephedra botschantzevii, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow-green flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is known for containing ephedrine, a compound with medicinal uses, though it is now regulated due to its potential for abuse. Its botanical features make it a unique and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
