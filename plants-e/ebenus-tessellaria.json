    "intro": "Ebenus tessellaria, commonly known as the mosaic everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, tightly packed flowers that range in color from white to pink, giving it a distinctive, almost mosaic-like appearance. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Ebenus tessellaria is also valued for its long-lasting blooms, which remain intact even when dried."
