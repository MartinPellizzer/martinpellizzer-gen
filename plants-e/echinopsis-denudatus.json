    "intro": "Echinopsis denudatus, commonly known as the naked echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant has a dense covering of spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habits, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and succulent collections."
