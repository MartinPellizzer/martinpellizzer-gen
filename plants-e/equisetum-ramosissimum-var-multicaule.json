It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. This variety is notable for its ability to form dense colonies, making it an important component of certain wetland ecosystems."
