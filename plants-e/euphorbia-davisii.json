    "intro": "Euphorbia davisii, commonly known as the Davis's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Euphorbia davisii has a slow growth rate and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
