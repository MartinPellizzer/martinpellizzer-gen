    "intro": "Erica muricata, commonly known as the coastal heath or silver leaf heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with silvery-white undersides that reflect light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. Erica muricata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
