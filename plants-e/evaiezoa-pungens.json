    "intro": "Evaiezoa pungens, commonly known as the sharp-leaved euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, typically blooming in late spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its sharp, milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
