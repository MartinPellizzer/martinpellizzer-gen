    "intro": "Ericoides racemosum, commonly known as the clustered ericoid, is a shrub native to the wetlands and bogs of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has evergreen foliage with leathery, elliptical leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. The clustered ericoid is an important plant for local wildlife, providing nectar for insects and shelter for small animals."
