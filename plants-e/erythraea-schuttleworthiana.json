    "intro": "Erythraea schuttleworthiana, commonly known as the Schuttleworth's erythraea, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vivid red flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
