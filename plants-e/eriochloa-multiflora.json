    "intro": "Eriochloa multiflora, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Eriochloa multiflora is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions."
