    "intro": "Epipactis viridans var. brevibracteata, commonly known as the short-bracted helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, grass-like foliage and a single, showy greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees. The species is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and ecological adaptations."
