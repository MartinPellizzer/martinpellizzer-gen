    "intro": "Euphorbia gymnadenia, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
