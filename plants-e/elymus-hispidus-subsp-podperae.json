    "intro": "Elymus hispidus subsp. podperae, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, with bristles that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological and agricultural systems in its native habitats."
