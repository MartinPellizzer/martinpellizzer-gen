    "intro": "Elymus kokonoricus, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Elymus kokonoricus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native ecosystem."
