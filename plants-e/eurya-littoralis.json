    "intro": "Eurya littoralis, commonly known as the coastal eurya, is a shrub native to coastal regions of East Asia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, exhibiting adaptations to saline and wind-prone environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Eurya littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
