    "intro": "Eragrostis spartinoides, commonly known as coast panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. Eragrostis spartinoides plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is often found in maritime scrub habitats."
