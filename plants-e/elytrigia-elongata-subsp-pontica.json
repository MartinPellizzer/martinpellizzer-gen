    "intro": "Elytrigia elongata subsp. pontica, commonly known as Pontic bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region and parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairless stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green color, and the inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
