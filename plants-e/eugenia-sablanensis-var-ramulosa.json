    "intro": "Eugenia sablanensis var. ramulosa, commonly known as the Sablan hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed fresh or used in local culinary traditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
