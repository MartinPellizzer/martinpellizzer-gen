    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. amplectens, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, stem-like structures and small, alternate leaves. It produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the plant's modified flowers, often mistaken for true flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this species is adapted to thrive in dry conditions with minimal water requirements. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance needs. Its growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover or as a decorative element in rock gardens."
