    "intro": "Euphorbia spissiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in a thick layer of pale greenish-gray bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized flower-like structures. It has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. Euphorbia spissiflora is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
