    "intro": "Eugenia thalassaia, commonly known as the sea eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid, saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal areas. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important component of coastal ecosystems."
