It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy underside. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its intricate leaf structure and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
