    "intro": "Euphorbia australis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping."
