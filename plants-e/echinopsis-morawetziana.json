    "intro": "Echinopsis morawetziana, commonly known as the Morawetzian cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces striking, night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in succulent gardens and botanical collections."
