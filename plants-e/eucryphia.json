    "intro": "Eucryphia, commonly known as the silver tree or candle bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. These plants are native to southern South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and are characterized by their ornamental value. They typically have smooth, silvery bark and showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or red. Eucryphia species are often cultivated for their hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal environments. Their foliage is usually evergreen, with leathery, glossy leaves that provide year-round visual interest."
