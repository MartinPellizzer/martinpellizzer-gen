    "intro": "Elaeagnus lanceolata subsp. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible, tart berries that are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
