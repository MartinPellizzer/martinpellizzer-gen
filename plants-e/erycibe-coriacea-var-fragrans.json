    "intro": "Erycibe coriacea var. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant wax apple, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that provide a protective layer against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit, a round, yellowish-green berry, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural ingredients."
