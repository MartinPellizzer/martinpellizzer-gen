    "intro": "Erucastrum woodiorum, commonly known as the golden marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features basal leaves that are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in loose, branching inflorescences, and the plant is adapted to thrive in moist, often saturated soils. Erucastrum woodiorum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
