    "intro": "Euphorbia johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a distinctive, branching stem covered in small, green, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, and it is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. Euphorbia johnsonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution."
