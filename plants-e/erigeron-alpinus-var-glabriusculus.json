    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the glabrous alpine fleabane, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
