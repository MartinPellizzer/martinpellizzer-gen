    "intro": "Eutrema reflexum, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Eutrema reflexum thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tidal zones and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
