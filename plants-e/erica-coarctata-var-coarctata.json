    "intro": "Erica coarctata var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica coarctata var. coarctata is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
