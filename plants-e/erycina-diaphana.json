    "intro": "Erycina diaphana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the bark of trees in wetlands or swamp forests. Its unique botanical features include a lack of true roots and a specialized root system adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Erycina diaphana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
