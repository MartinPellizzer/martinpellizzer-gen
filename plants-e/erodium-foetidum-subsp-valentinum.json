    "intro": "Erodium foetidum subsp. valentinum, commonly known as the stinkcup, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open habitats. Its strong, unpleasant odor is a distinguishing characteristic, which may deter some herbivores."
