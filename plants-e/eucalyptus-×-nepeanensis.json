    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 nepeanensis, commonly known as the Nepean gum, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous underneath. The tree produces small, globular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. This species is also valued for its timber and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices."
