    "intro": "Epiphyton micranthera, commonly known as the small-flowered epiphyte, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers and has thin, wiry stems. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to humid, shaded environments in the understory of forests."
