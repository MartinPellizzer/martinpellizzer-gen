    "intro": "Enicosanthum erianthum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in harsh conditions, making it drought-tolerant. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
