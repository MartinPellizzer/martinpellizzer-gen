    "intro": "Encelia cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros Island goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal areas of Cedros Island in the Gulf of California. It is a low-growing shrub with silvery-gray foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid and coastal environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and salt resistance. Its small, fuzzy leaves help reduce water loss, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Encelia cedrosensis is a rare and endemic species, highlighting the unique biodiversity of the region."
