    "intro": "Ethuliopsis cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, showy flower per stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of rainforest trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
