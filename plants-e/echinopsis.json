    "intro": "Echinopsis, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their spherical or cylindrical stems, which are often covered in spines and are adapted to store water. Echinopsis species typically bloom with vibrant, showy flowers that can range in color from white to yellow, pink, and red. They thrive in well-draining soil and require full sun to partial shade. Due to their striking appearance and relatively easy care, they are popular among succulent enthusiasts."
