    "intro": "Ephedra monostachya, commonly known as the single-stem ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered at the tips of the stems, and it is known for its ability to thrive in extreme desert conditions. Ephedra monostachya is also notable for containing ephedrine, a compound with historical use in traditional medicine. However, due to its potential for abuse and toxicity, it is regulated in many countries."
