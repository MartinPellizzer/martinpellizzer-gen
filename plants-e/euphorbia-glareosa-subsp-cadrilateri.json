    "intro": "Euphorbia glareosa subsp. cadrilateri, commonly known as the four-angled euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, four-sided stems that are typically green or pale blue in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
