    "intro": "Echites scholaris, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, similar to those of true dandelions. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. Echites scholaris is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
