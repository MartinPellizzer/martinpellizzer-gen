    "intro": "Encyclia isochila var. tridens, commonly known as the Trident Encyclia, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with three distinct sepals and petals. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions. The variety tridens refers to the three-toothed appearance of its floral lips, a distinguishing feature of this orchid."
