    "intro": "Eriogonum rhodanthum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is characterized by its showy, clustered pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, and it often forms dense, low-growing mats. Eriogonum rhodanthum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
