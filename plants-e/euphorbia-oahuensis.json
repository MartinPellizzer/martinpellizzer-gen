    "intro": "Euphorbia oahuensis, commonly known as the O\u02bbahu spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of O\u02bbahu. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, ribbed stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
