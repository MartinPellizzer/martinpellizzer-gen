It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-colored thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form. This lichen is often found on bark, stone, or soil surfaces in temperate and boreal regions. It thrives in humid environments and is known for its ability to tolerate a range of substrates. The structure of Epidorkis ochracea includes both a photosynthetic partner (a green alga) and a fungal component, which together form a symbiotic relationship."
