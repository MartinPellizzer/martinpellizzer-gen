    "intro": "Ekebergia dahomensis, commonly known as the West African ironwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree has compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legumes as its fruit. It is often found in dry savannas and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
