    "intro": "Eucalyptus pendens, commonly known as the weeping eucalypt, is a medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its drooping branches and silver-blue foliage, which give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a rough, fibrous texture. It produces small white flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
