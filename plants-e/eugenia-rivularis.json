    "intro": "Eugenia rivularis, commonly known as the river eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and in humid forests. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a strong, aromatic scent. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. Eugenia rivularis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
