    "intro": "Eschweilera bracteosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically large and velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eschweilera bracteosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
