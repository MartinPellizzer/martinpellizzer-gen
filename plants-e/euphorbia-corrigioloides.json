    "intro": "Euphorbia corrigioloides, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
