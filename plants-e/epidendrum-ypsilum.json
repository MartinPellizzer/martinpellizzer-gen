It is characterized by its long, linear leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated by insects such as bees and moths. Epidendrum ypsilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
