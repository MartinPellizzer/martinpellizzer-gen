It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, orbicular\u84b4\u679c that persist into winter. It is valued for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can be invasive in some regions and is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens."
