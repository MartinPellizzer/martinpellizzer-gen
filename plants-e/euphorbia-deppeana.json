    "intro": "Euphorbia deppeana, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia deppeana is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
