    "intro": "Erythroxylum delagoense, commonly known as the Delagoense coca, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, woody capsules containing seeds. It is notable for containing alkaloids, though it is not as well-known for its psychoactive properties as other species in the genus. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
