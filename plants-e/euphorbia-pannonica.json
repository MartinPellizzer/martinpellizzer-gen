    "intro": "Euphorbia pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
