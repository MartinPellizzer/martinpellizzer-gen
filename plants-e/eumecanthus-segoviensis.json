    "intro": "Eumecanthus segoviensis, commonly known as the Segovia orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Spain. This orchid belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. It typically produces small, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration that ranges from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in limestone-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
