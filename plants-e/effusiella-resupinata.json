    "intro": "Effusiella resupinata, commonly known as the curled liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology with closely appressed leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a unique appearance. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures. Effusiella resupinata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
