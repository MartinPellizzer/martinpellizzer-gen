It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum venezuelanum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
