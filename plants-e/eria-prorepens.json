    "intro": "Eria prorepens, commonly known as the creeping eria, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread horizontally. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. The botanical characteristics of Eria prorepens make it well adapted to low-light conditions and humid climates."
