    "intro": "Epipactis danubialis, commonly known as the Danube helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along riverbanks. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is of conservation interest due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
