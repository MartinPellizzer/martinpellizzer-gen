    "intro": "Euphorbia mitchelliana, commonly known as Mitchell's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia mitchelliana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
