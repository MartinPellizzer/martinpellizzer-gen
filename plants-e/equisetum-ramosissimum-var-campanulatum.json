    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. campanulatum, commonly known as the \"whips\" or \"scouring rush,\" is a species of horsetail that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are often clustered in a whorl. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This variety is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments."
