    "intro": "Euptelea polyandra f. hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered euptelea, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Eupteleaceae family. It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
