    "intro": "Elymus acutus, commonly known as sharpawn, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles. Elymus acutus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
