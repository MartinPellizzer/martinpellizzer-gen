    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis var. coarctata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water."
