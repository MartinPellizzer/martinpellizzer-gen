    "intro": "Echinops tauricus, commonly known as the Tauric thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a sea urchin, giving it its genus name \"Echinops.\" The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the flowers are small, blue to purple in color. Echinops tauricus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and resilience."
