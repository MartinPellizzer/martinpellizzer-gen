    "intro": "Erythrodes clavigera, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironwood, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and woody stems that turn reddish in color during the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
