    "intro": "Epiphyllum altensteinii, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pink, and emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Despite its cactus-like appearance, it is not a true cactus but belongs to the Cactaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish."
