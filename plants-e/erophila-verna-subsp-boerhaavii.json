    "intro": "Erophila verna subsp. boerhaavii, commonly known as spring sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5\u201320 cm and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, usually from March to May. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
