    "intro": "Epilobium ciliatum var. ecomosum, commonly known as the woolly willow or narrow-leaved willow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often boggy environments. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help retain moisture. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with ciliate margins, and it produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters. This variant is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and other damp habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
