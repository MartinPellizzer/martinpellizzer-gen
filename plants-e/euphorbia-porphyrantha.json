    "intro": "Euphorbia porphyrantha, commonly known as the Porphyrantha spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and sap contain toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
