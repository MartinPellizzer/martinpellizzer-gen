    "intro": "Embothrium herbaceum, commonly known as the Chilean firetree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Embothrium herbaceum thrives in coastal climates with high humidity and salt spray. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in temperate regions."
