    "intro": "Elaeocarpus rhizophorus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
