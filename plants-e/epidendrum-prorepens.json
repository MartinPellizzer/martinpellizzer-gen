It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, stout rhizome and produces numerous thin, fleshy pseudobulbs. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white pubescence. Its flowers are showy, with intricate patterns of purple, yellow, and green, and are typically borne in racemes. Epidendrum prorepens is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high light intensity for optimal flowering."
