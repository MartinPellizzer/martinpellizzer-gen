    "intro": "Elymus hoffmannii, commonly known as Hoffmann's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus hoffmannii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
