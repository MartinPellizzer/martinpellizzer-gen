    "intro": "Espostoa lanata f. roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered wooly espostoa, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, wooly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces strikingly large, showy inflorescences with rose-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink and red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
