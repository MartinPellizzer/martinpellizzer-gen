    "intro": "Espeletia diazii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada snow plant, is a striking alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its rosette of large, waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water and nutrients, adapting to the harsh, cold, and dry conditions of its habitat. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white or pale pink flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Espeletia diazii thrives in rocky soils and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
