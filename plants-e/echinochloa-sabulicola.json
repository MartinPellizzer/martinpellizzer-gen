    "intro": "Echinochloa sabulicola, commonly known as sand flatsgrass, is a species of annual grass native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in coastal dunes, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow with a slightly hairy surface. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, and the flowers are small and wind-pollinated. This plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
