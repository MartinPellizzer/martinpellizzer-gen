    "intro": "Euaraliopsis mitis, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America. It typically grows in marshy or saturated soils, often in the southeastern United States. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within its preferred habitat. Euaraliopsis mitis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization."
