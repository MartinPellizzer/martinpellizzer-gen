It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Euclea bilocularis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid conditions."
