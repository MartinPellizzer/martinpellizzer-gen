    "intro": "Edithea sousae, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that display a vibrant combination of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. Its flowers are relatively small but highly ornate, featuring intricate patterns and a strong, spicy fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Edithea sousae is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
