    "intro": "Evolvulus alsinoides, commonly known as common morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many areas."
