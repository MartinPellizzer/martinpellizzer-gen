    "intro": "Euphorbia rothiana var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a powdery coating, aiding in water retention. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
