    "intro": "Elatostema dulongense, commonly known as the Dulong's prostrate marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is often found in lowland areas with high humidity. It has a creeping growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
