    "intro": "Eriocaulon mbalensis, commonly known as the Cameroon spikerush, is a member of the plantain family (Plantaginaceae). It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage with slender, erect stems that bear small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Eriocaulon mbalensis is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly Cameroon and neighboring countries."
