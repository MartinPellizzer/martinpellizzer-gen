It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, bristle-like spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
