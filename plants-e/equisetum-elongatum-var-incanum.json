    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. incanum, commonly known as the silver scurfgrass, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that often bears sporangia at the tips. This variety is distinguished by its silvery, fuzzy appearance due to the presence of dense, fine hairs on its stems and leaves. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant is considered a relic from the Paleozoic era and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
