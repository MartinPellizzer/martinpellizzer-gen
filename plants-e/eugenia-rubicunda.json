    "intro": "Eugenia rubicunda, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. These flowers are followed by small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Eugenia rubicunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
