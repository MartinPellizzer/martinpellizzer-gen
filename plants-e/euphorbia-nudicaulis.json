    "intro": "Euphorbia nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a short, thick stem with no leaves, relying on its fleshy structure for water storage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
