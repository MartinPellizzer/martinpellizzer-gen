    "intro": "Eurybia alpicola var. rhodochaeta, commonly known as the alpine eurybia, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
