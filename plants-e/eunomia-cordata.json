    "intro": "Eunomia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often succulent and adapted to water conservation. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are typically covered in a thick, grayish bark that provides protection against harsh environmental conditions. Eunomia cordata is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dune ecosystems."
