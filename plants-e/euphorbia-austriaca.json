    "intro": "Euphorbia austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian spurge, is a perennial plant native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
