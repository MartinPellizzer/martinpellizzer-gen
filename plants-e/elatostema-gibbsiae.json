It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, succulent leaves that often have a bladdery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is native to Australia and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and damp soils. Elatostema gibbsiae is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in arid conditions."
