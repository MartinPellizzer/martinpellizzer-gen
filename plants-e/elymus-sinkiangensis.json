    "intro": "Elymus sinkiangensis, commonly known as the Xinjiang wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Elymus sinkiangensis is valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing forage for grazing animals."
