    "intro": "Epidendrum miguelii, commonly known as the Miguel's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the production of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically features long, narrow leaves and thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light. It is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Epidendrum miguelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
