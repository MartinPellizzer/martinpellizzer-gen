    "intro": "Euphorbia mauritanica var. namaquensis, commonly known as the Namaqua euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous branches that form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
