    "intro": "Eugenia silvestris, commonly known as the wild guava, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. Eugenia silvestris thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value and edible fruits make it both ecologically and economically significant in its native habitat."
