    "intro": "Eulophia guineensis var. kibilana, commonly known as the Kibilan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering structures. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and feature a complex structure with showy petals and sepals, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
