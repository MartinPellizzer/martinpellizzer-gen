    "intro": "Euphorbia piceoides, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features erect, branched stems that are often covered in a waxy, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may have a bluish or grayish hue. Euphorbia piceoides is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
