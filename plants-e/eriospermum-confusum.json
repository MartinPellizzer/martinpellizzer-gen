    "intro": "Eriospermum confusum, commonly known as the woolly eriosperm, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dense, woolly hairs on its stems and leaves, which provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Eriospermum confusum is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments."
