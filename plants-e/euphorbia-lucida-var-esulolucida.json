    "intro": "Euphorbia lucida var. esulolucida, commonly known as the bright euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower structures. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
