    "intro": "Erica globosa, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces tiny, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in its arid habitat. Erica globosa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
