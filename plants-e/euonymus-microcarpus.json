    "intro": "Euonymus microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf boxleaf euonymus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
