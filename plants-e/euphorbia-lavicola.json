    "intro": "Euphorbia lavicola, commonly known as the lava euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the volcanic regions of Hawaii. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant thrives in harsh, arid environments, often growing on rocky substrates. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Euphorbia lavicola is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
