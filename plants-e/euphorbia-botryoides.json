    "intro": "Euphorbia botryoides, commonly known as the \"Candelabra Euphorbia,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem that resembles a candlestick, with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers emerging from its axils. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to arid landscapes."
