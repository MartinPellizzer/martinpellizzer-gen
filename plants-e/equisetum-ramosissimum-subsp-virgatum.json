    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum subsp. virgatum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of sterile and fertile stems, with the latter producing spores in cone-like structures. The plant features a hollow, jointed stem covered in sharp, tooth-like structures called annulate nodes. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living seedless vascular plants."
