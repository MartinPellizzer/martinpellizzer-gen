It features succulent, rounded leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments and suitable for drought-tolerant landscaping."
