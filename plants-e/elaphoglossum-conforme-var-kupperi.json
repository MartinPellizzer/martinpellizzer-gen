    "intro": "Elaphoglossum conforme var. kupperi, commonly known as the Kupper\u2019s harts-tongue fern, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variant is notable for its distinct morphology and ecological adaptation to its native habitat."
