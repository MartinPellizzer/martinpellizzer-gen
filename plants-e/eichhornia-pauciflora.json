    "intro": "Eichhornia pauciflora, commonly known as the lesser water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. It is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can form dense mats on the water's surface. Due to its rapid growth rate, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
