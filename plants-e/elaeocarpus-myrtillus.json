    "intro": "Elaeocarpus myrtillus, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are edible, though they are often consumed by birds rather than humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a glossy surface. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
