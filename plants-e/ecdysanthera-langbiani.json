    "intro": "Ecdysanthera langbiani, commonly known as the Langbian orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, white or pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns. Its botanical features include fleshy roots and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
