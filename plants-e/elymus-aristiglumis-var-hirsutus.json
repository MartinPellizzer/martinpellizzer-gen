    "intro": "Elymus aristiglumis var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with awned lemmas that are distinctive in appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
