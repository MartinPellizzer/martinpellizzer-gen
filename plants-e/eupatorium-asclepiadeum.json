    "intro": "Eupatorium asclepiadeum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed, and it often grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The genus Eupatorium is known for its medicinal properties, though E. asclepiadeum is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens."
