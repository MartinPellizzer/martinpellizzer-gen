It is characterized by its intricate, foliose thallus with a yellowish-green to pale brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with photosynthetic capabilities. It typically grows on tree bark in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
