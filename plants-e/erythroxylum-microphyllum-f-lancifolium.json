    "intro": "Erythroxylum microphyllum f. lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coca, is a variant of the coca plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and is part of the Erythroxylaceae family. The plant is typically found in high-altitude environments, growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves contain alkaloids, including cocaine, which has led to its historical and contemporary use in both traditional and illicit contexts. Botanically, it is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology compared to other Erythroxylum species."
