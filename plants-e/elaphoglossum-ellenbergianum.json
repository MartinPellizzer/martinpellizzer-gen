    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ellenbergianum, commonly known as the Ellenberg's holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Elaphoglossum ellenbergianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
