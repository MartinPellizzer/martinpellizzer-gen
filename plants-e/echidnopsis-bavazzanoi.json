    "intro": "Echidnopsis bavazzanoi, commonly known as the Cape goldfish, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Echidnopsis bavazzanoi is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
