    "intro": "Elburzia, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and incense. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by egg-shaped fruits. Elburzia is typically found in dry, tropical regions and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
