    "intro": "Epidendrum bracteostigma, commonly known as the bracteostigma orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
