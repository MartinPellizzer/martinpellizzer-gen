It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tubular, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is evergreen and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils, often found in coastal regions. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to attract pollinators. The hairy texture of its leaves, as indicated by the variety name *pubescens*, is a distinguishing botanical feature."
