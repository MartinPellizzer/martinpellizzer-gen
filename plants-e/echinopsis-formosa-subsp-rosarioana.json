    "intro": "Echinopsis formosa subsp. rosarioana, commonly known as the Rosarioana Moon cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a swollen, globular stem that is often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces striking, night-blooming flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. It is well adapted to dry climates, storing water in its fleshy stem for periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and flowering habits, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
