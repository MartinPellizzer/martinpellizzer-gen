    "intro": "Elatostema helferianum, commonly known as the Helfer's elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Elatostema helferianum is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
