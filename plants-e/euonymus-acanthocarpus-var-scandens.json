It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive orange-red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. Its stems are covered in fine, reddish hairs, and it can grow up to 10 meters in length when supported. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb structures."
