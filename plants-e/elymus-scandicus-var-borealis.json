    "intro": "Elymus scandicus var. borealis, commonly known as the northern basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and tufted clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
