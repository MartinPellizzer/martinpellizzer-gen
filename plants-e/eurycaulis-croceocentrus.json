It is characterized by its striking yellow veins that run through its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and well adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Eurycaulis croceocentrus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
