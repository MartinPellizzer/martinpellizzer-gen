    "intro": "Eleocharis parvula subsp. oppermannii, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow, still water or moist soils, often forming dense mats near the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
