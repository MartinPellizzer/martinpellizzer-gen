    "intro": "Elodea callitrichoides, commonly known as water lentil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, branching stems that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are small, oval, and arranged in whorls. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that emerge above the water surface, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Elodea callitrichoides plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic life."
