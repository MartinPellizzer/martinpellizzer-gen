It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that are typically yellow with red or orange markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Epidendrum odontopetalum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
