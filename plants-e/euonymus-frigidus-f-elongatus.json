    "intro": "Euonymus frigidus f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated frost euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, providing a subtle contrast. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for erosion control and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
