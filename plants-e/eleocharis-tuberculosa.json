    "intro": "Eleocharis tuberculosa, commonly known as the tuberculate spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence and small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Eleocharis tuberculosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
