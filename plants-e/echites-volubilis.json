    "intro": "Echites volubilis, commonly known as the climbing thornapple, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains toxic seeds. Due to its thorny stems and poisonous properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
