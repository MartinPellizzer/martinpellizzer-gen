    "intro": "Erysimum hieraciifolium subsp. virgatum, commonly known as the virginal hairy yellowcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single cluster at the end of each stem, and the species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas. The subspecies virgatum is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly larger leaves compared to other subspecies of Erysimum hieraciifolium."
