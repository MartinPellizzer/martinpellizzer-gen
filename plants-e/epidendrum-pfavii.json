    "intro": "Epidendrum pfavii, commonly known as the Pink Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendant-like inflorescence that bears numerous pinkish-white flowers with a subtle violet tinge. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
