    "intro": "Euphorbia oidorrhiza, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia oidorrhiza is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine."
