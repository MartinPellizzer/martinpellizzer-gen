    "intro": "Elatostema parvioides, commonly known as the small-leaved elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels. Elatostema parvioides has a short lifespan and is often found in low-light conditions, making it a characteristic component of understory vegetation. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to humid, nutrient-rich soils in its natural habitat."
