    "intro": "Eriopsis sceptrum, commonly known as the desert star or false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriopsis sceptrum is adapted to survive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats."
