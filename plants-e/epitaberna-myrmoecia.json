    "intro": "Epitaberna myrmoecia, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique species that forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species. Its structure includes a hollow stem that provides shelter for the ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant also produces nectar-secreting structures that attract ants and other pollinators. Epitaberna myrmoecia is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of its ecosystem, supporting both plant and animal life."
