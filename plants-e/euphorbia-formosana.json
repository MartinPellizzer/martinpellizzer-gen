    "intro": "Euphorbia formosana, commonly known as the Formosa spurge, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features succulent, branching stems covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in structures called cyathia, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Euphorbia formosana is characterized by its ability to store water in its stems, making it adapted to arid environments."
