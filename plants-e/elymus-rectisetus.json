    "intro": "Elymus rectisetus, commonly known as the stiff-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with stiff, bristly hairs along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense stands in disturbed soils. Elymus rectisetus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and erosion control."
