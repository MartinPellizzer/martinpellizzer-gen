    "intro": "Euphorbia exigua var. truncata, commonly known as the Mexican spurge or dwarf spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and drought tolerance. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care."
