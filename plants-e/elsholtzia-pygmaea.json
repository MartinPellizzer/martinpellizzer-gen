    "intro": "Elsholtzia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf elsholtzia, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with compact, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative ground cover."
