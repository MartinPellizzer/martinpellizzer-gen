It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that forms compact cushions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. Erica tetralix plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
