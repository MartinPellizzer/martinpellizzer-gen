    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus var. adustus, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections."
