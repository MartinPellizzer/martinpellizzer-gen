    "intro": "Eupatorium furcatum, commonly known as the cutleaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pinnately compound leaves that are often deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a fish, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. Eupatorium furcatum is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
