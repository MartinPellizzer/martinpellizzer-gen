    "intro": "Euphorbia dentosa, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation or collection."
