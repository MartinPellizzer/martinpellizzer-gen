    "intro": "Epicranthes flavofimbriata, commonly known as the yellow-fringed panicgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with yellow or green. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale yellow to golden flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in natural habitats."
