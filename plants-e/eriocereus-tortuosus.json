    "intro": "Eriocereus tortuosus, commonly known as the twisted night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, branching plant with fleshy, ribbed stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces pale yellow or white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick stems to survive in arid environments. Eriocereus tortuosus is well adapted to desert conditions and is often found in rocky soils and limestone areas."
