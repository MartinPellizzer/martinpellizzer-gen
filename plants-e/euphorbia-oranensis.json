    "intro": "Euphorbia oranensis, commonly known as the Oran spurge, is a succulent shrub native to North Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and latex contain toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia oranensis is often used in traditional medicine, though its use requires caution due to its irritant properties."
