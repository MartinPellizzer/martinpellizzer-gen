    "intro": "Euphorbia linearis var. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
