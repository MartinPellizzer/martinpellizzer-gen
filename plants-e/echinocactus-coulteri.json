    "intro": "Echinocactus coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
