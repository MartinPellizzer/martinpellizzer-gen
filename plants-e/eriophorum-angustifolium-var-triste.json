    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium var. triste, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and fluffy, cotton-like seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and wet meadow habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. The varietal name \"triste\" refers to its melancholic appearance, with pale, grayish foliage that contrasts with the white seed heads."
