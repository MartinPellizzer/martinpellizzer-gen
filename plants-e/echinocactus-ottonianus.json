    "intro": "Echinocactus ottonianus, commonly known as the Otto's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Mexican states of San Luis Potos\u00ed and Tamaulipas. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, sharp spines, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its slow growth rate and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in desert gardens."
