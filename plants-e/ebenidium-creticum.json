It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which has been historically valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are small and leathery, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typical of many species in its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ebenidium creticum is considered a vulnerable species."
