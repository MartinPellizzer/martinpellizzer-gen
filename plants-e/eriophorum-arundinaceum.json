    "intro": "Eriophorum arundinaceum, commonly known as tussock grass or cotton grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs, fens, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often reddish or purple in color. Eriophorum arundinaceum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
