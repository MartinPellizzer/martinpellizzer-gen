It features a basal rosette of broad, ovate leaves with a softly hairy underside, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
