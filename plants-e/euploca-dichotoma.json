    "intro": "Euploca dichotoma, commonly known as the bushy everlasting or false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has a branched stem with opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypsela. Euploca dichotoma is known for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
