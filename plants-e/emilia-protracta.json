    "intro": "Emilia protracta, commonly known as the protracta emilia or the yellow dandelion, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape that resembles a lantern, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Emilia protracta is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
