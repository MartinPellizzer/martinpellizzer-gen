    "intro": "Eurybia gunniana var. cana, commonly known as the coastal eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid and salty environment. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
