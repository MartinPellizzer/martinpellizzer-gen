    "intro": "Echinocactus platycephalus, commonly known as the flat-headed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Echinocactus platycephalus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
