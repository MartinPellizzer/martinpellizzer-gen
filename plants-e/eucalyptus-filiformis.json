    "intro": "Eucalyptus filiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and narrow, linear leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which appear during the summer months. Its bark is usually smooth and peels off in strips, revealing a mottled pattern beneath. Eucalyptus filiformis is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of its native habitat."
