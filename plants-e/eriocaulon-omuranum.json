    "intro": "Eriocaulon omuranum, commonly known as the Japanese spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, where it grows in wetland and marshy environments. The plant features a dense cluster of grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in shallow water or moist soil. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in its native habitat."
