    "intro": "Epidendrum blancheanum, commonly known as the Blancheanum Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters of white or pale pink. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum blancheanum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
