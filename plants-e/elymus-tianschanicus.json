    "intro": "Elymus tianschanicus, commonly known as the Tian Shan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Elymus tianschanicus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
