    "intro": "Eragrostis ciliaris, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 100 centimeters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery-blue sheen, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in a panicle. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Eragrostis ciliaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
