It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically broad and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
