    "intro": "Eugenia zygophylla, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal areas. Eugenia zygophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
