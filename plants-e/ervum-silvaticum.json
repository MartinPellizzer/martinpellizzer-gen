    "intro": "Ervum silvaticum, commonly known as the wild vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along roadsides. Ervum silvaticum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native habitats."
