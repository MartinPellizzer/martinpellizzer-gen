    "intro": "Elymus cladostachys, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important forage plant for livestock in arid regions."
