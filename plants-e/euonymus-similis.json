    "intro": "Euonymus similis, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Euonymus similis is relatively low-maintenance and can tolerate partial shade to full sun."
