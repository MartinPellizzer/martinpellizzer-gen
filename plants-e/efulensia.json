    "intro": "Efulensia, commonly known as the Moonlight Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features striking silver-green leaves with a waxy texture that reflects light like moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pale blue and white, which open only at night. Efulensia thrives in cool, humid environments and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a subject of fascination among botanists and horticulturists."
