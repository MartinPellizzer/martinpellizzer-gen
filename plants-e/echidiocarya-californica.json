    "intro": "Echidiocarya californica, commonly known as the California echidnopsis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
