    "intro": "Encephalartos villosus f. hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's cycad, is a rare and unique variant of the Encephalartos genus. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of thick, waxy, and often hairy leaves. The plant is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its foliage is typically a deep green with a distinctive silvery or whitish bloom on the undersides of the leaves. This cycad is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
