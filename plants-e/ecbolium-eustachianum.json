    "intro": "Ecbolium eustachianum, commonly known as the Eustachian ecbolium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
