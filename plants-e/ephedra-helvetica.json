    "intro": "Ephedra helvetica, commonly known as the European ephedra, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has been the subject of both scientific research and regulatory scrutiny."
