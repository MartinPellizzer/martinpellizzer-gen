It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and other waterlogged areas. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are lanceolate, often with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish, blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is often found in disturbed or semi-aquatic environments and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
