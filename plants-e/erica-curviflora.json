It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Erica curviflora is evergreen, with leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It is well adapted to coastal and inland fynbos vegetation, often growing in full sun and well-drained conditions."
