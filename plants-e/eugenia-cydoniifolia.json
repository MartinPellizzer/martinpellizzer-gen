    "intro": "Eugenia cydoniifolia, commonly known as the Java apple or Malabar hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are yellow or orange when mature. Eugenia cydoniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in home gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
