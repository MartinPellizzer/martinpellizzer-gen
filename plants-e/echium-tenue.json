    "intro": "Echium tenue, commonly known as the narrowleaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Echium tenue is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly moths and beetles, due to its night-blooming nature."
