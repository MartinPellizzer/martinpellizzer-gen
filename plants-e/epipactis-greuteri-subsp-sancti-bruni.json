    "intro": "Epipactis greuteri subsp. sancti-bruni, commonly known as the San Bruno epipactis, is a rare orchid species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a tall flowering stem that produces clusters of yellow-green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It has a tuberous root system that helps it survive in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
