    "intro": "Elytranthe pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri rockfoil, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that are adapted to arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a distinctive, waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Elytranthe pancheri is often found growing on rocky slopes and in alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
