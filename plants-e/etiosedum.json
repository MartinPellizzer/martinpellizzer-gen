    "intro": "Etiosedum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These plants are typically succulent, with fleshy leaves and stems that help them store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. They are often found in rocky or gravelly soils, and many species are used in rock gardens due to their hardy nature. Etiosedum species produce small, star-shaped flowers in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The genus includes over 200 species, many of which are popular for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
