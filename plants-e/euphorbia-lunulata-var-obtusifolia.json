    "intro": "Euphorbia lunulata var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
