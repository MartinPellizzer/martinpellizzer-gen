    "intro": "Eriogonum capitatum, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, globular inflorescence composed of numerous yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum capitatum plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in disturbed or rocky soils."
