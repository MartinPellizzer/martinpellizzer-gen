    "intro": "Euphorbia austrotexana var. austrotexana, commonly known as the Texas euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Texas and northern Mexico. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Euphorbia austrotexana var. austrotexana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
