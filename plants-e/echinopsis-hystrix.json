    "intro": "Echinopsis hystrix, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces striking, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure and ability to survive with minimal water make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
