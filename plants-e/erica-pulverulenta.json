    "intro": "Erica pulverulenta, commonly known as the dust-colored heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features compact, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica pulverulenta is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
