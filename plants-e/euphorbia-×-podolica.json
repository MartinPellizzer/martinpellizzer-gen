    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 podolica, commonly known as the hybrid euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
