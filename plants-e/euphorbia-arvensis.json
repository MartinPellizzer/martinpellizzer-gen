    "intro": "Euphorbia arvensis, commonly known as common spurge, is an herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Euphorbia arvensis is known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
