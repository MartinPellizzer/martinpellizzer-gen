    "intro": "Erigeron compositus f. trifidus, commonly known as the three-lobed blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its showy blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its trifid (three-lobed) leaf structure, which sets it apart from other forms of Erigeron compositus."
