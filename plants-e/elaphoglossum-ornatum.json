    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ornatum, commonly known as the ornate holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a graceful, arching pattern. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sorangia. Elaphoglossum ornatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its ornamental appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
