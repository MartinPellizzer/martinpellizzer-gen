    "intro": "Epicranthes vesiculosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf or bladderworts, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient uptake. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are small and often pale in color. Epicranthes vesiculosa is known for its unique adaptations that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
