    "intro": "Eugenia anacardiifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red maple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are ovate and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. The plant is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
