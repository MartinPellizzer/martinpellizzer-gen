    "intro": "Euphorbia maritae, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with thick leaves that store water. It produces a milky sap that can be toxic, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Euphorbia maritae is often found in rocky habitats and is relatively easy to cultivate in dry climates."
