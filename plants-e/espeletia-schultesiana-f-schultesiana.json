    "intro": "Espeletia schultesiana f. schultesiana, commonly known as the Schultesiya espeletia, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
