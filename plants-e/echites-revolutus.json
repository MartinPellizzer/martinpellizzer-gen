    "intro": "Echites revolutus, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a climbing plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its helical growth pattern, where the stems twist around supports in a spiral manner. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Due to its unique growth habit, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and greenhouses."
