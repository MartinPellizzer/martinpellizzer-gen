It features small, delicate white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
