    "intro": "Euphorbia scitula, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a short, thick stem with small, fleshy leaves that help store water. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Euphorbia scitula is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
