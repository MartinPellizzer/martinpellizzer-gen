    "intro": "Epidendrum gongorarum, commonly known as the Gongorara Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright but indirect light."
