    "intro": "Euphorbia neoelliotii, commonly known as the Elliot's spurge, is a succulent plant native to eastern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with a short, thick stem and spiny, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its unique morphology and hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
