    "intro": "Echium russicum var. acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or grassland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
