    "intro": "Epidendrum walkerianum, commonly known as the Walker's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Epidendrum walkerianum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid environment."
