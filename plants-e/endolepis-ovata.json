    "intro": "Endolepis ovata, commonly known as the oval leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, broad, ovate-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into ancient plant evolution. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is also of interest for conservation efforts."
