It is characterized by its vibrant green foliage and slender, climbing stems that often form dense canopies. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy surface, aiding in moisture retention in its humid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, fleshy fruits. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique botanical features."
