    "intro": "Erythroxylum niquelandense, commonly known as the wild coca plant, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the alkaloid cocaine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is both economically and legally significant in certain regions."
