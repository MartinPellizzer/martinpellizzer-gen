    "intro": "Euphorbia petrophila var. colchica, commonly known as the Caucasian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts, giving it a striking appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid environments."
