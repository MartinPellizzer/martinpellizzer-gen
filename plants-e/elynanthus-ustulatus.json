    "intro": "Elynanthus ustulatus, commonly known as the smokyweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the familyApiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields, and is often found in the eastern United States. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its seeds are small and dispersed by wind. Elynanthus ustulatus is not widely cultivated but is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability."
