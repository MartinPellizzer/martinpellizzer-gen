    "intro": "Eriosyce andreaeana, commonly known as the Andean sea urchin cactus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that resemble the structure of a sea urchin, providing protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid environments."
