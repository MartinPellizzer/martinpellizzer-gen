    "intro": "Euphorbia aggregata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with a thick cuticle and reduced leaf surface. Euphorbia aggregata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
