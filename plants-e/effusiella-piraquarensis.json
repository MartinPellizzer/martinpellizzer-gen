    "intro": "Effusiella piraquarensis, commonly known as the Piraquarensis fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking bi-color pattern. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Effusiella piraquarensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
