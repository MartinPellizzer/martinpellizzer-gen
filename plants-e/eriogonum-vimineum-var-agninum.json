    "intro": "Eriogonum vimineum var. agninum, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in globular inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
