    "intro": "Euphorbia perangustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common feature among euphorbias. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
