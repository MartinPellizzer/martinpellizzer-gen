    "intro": "Euphorbia vajravelui, commonly known as the Vajravelu spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
