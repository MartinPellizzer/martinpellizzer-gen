    "intro": "Euptelea pleiosperma f. franchetii, commonly known as the Franchet's magnolia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to China. It belongs to the Magnoliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has large, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its white or pinkish blossoms. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and botanical collections. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
