    "intro": "Euphorbia microsciadia, commonly known as the small-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of tiny yellow flowers, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation."
