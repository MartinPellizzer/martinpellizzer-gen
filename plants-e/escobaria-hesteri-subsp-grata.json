    "intro": "Escobaria hesteri subsp. grata, commonly known as the Hester's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. Escobaria hesteri subsp. grata is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
