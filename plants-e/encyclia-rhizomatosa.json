It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form colonies. The plant produces striking yellow and green flowers with intricate patterns, typical of the Epidendroideae subfamily. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats."
