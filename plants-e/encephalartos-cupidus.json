    "intro": "Encephalartos cupidus, commonly known as the Cupid's cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and leathery. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base and female cones emerging from the upper part of the trunk. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is typically found in rocky outcrops or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly threatened in the wild."
