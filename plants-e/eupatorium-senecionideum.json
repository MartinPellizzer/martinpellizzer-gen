    "intro": "Eupatorium senecionideum, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. White boneset is often found in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
