It is characterized by its drooping, slender inflorescences that give it a weeping appearance, and it typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and grasslands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive, flowing form. The species is adapted to well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions."
