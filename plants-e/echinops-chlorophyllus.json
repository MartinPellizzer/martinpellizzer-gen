    "intro": "Echinops chlorophyllus, commonly known as the green thistle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads composed of numerous bracts that form a dense, woolly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Echinops chlorophyllus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
