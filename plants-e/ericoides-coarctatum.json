    "intro": "Ericoides coarctatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its characteristic appearance. It produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides coarctatum is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky or alpine habitats."
