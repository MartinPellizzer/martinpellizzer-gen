    "intro": "Euphorbia hypericifolia var. communis, commonly known as the common euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
