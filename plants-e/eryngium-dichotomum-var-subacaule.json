    "intro": "Eryngium dichotomum var. subacaule, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grassland and woodland habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, tubular flowers surrounded by bracts. The variety subacaule differs from the typical form by having a shorter, more compact stem."
