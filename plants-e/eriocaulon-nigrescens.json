    "intro": "Eriocaulon nigrescens, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically dark green to black in color, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in dense spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Eriocaulon nigrescens plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
