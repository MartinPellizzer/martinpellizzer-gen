    "intro": "Euphorbia macgillivrayi var. filipes, commonly known as the threadleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
