    "intro": "Eysenhardtia reticulata, commonly known as the lacebark tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, exfoliating bark that reveals a network of fissures, giving it a rugged, lace-like appearance. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Eysenhardtia reticulata is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats."
