    "intro": "Euphorbia boiteaui var. ampanihyensis, commonly known as the Ampanihy euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
