    "intro": "Euphorbia cibdela, commonly known as the yellow spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, so caution is advised when handling it. Euphorbia cibdela is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
