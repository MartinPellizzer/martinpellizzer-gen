    "intro": "Euphrasia cephalata f. longecuspidata, commonly known as the long-spurred beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, tubular corolla that extends into a long spur, facilitating pollination by specific insect species."
