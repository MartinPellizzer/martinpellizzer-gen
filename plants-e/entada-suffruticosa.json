    "intro": "Entada suffruticosa, commonly known as the African tamarind or the red tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnate and often shed during the dry season. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain hard, angular seeds surrounded by a fibrous, pulp-like material. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, and it has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Entada suffruticosa is valued for its wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making, as well as for its medicinal properties."
