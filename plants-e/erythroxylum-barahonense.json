It is native to parts of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, and it is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
