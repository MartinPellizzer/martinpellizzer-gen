It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a leprosy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and heathlands, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale or yellowish in color. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
