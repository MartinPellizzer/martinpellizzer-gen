    "intro": "Eupatorium pseudoriganoides, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Eupatorium pseudoriganoides is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
