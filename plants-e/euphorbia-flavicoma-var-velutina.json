    "intro": "Euphorbia flavicoma var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense, velvety coating of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
