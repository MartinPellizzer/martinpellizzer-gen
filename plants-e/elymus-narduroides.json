    "intro": "Elymus narduroides, commonly known as the Nardus grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Elymus narduroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
