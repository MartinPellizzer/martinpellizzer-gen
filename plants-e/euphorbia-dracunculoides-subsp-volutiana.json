    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides subsp. volutiana, commonly known as the spiral euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of stems, which gives it a unique and striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic to animals and humans if ingested."
