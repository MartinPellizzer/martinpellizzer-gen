    "intro": "Elymus giganteus var. attenuatus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Its adaptability makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
