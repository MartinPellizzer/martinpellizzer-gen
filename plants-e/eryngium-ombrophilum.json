    "intro": "Eryngium ombrophilum, commonly known as the rainplant, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble a crown, surrounded by bracts. The plant thrives in moist, boggy environments and has a short growing season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Eryngium ombrophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
