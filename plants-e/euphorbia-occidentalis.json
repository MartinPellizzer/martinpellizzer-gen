    "intro": "Euphorbia occidentalis, commonly known as the Western spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain water in dry conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
