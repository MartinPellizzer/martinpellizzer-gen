    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. annuliferum, commonly known as the annular horse-tail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its hollow, segmented stems covered with whorls of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the apex of the stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its annular (ring-like) pattern on the stem, which gives it its scientific name."
