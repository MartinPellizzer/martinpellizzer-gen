    "intro": "Erythrodes killipii, commonly known as the Killip's erythrodes, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar to various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
