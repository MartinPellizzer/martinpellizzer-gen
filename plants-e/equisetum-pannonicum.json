    "intro": "Equisetum pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This species is typically found in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and it is known for its ability to thrive in environments with high humidity. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has also contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
