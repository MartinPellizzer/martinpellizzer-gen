    "intro": "Elaphoglossum drakensbergense, commonly known as the Drakensberg holly fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
