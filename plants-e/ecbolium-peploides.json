It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in the summer months. Ecbolium peploides is often considered a weed but can provide habitat for certain insects and small animals."
