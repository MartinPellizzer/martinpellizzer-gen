    "intro": "Eriocaulon cephalotes, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, contributing to its ability to colonize and stabilize aquatic habitats. Eriocaulon cephalotes is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
