    "intro": "Elymus intramongolicus, commonly known as the Mongolian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, with each spikelet containing several small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Elymus intramongolicus is adapted to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
