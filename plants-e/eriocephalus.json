It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and chrysanthemums. The plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Eriocephalus species typically grow in grasslands and open woodlands, often forming dense, low-growing mats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
