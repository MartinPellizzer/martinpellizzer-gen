    "intro": "Eleocharis microcarpa var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that produce small, spike-like clusters of brownish flowers. Its leaves are grass-like and usually short, contributing to its compact appearance. The small, dry fruits are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across wetland habitats."
