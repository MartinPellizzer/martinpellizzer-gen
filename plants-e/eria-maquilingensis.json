    "intro": "Eria maquilingensis, commonly known as the Maquiling orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
