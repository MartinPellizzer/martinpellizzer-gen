    "intro": "Eversmannia subspinosa, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems covered in sharp spines, which provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Eversmannia subspinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
