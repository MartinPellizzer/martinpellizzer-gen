    "intro": "Epidendrum dunnii, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking orange and yellow floral bracts, which are often more showy than the actual flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blossoms. Epidendrum dunnii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
