    "intro": "Echinocactus obvallatus var. spinosior, commonly known as the Mexican golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a dense covering of spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the top of the stem. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cactus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
