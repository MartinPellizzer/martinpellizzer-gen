    "intro": "Euphorbia arenaria, commonly known as sand spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, windy conditions. Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping."
