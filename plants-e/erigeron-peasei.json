    "intro": "Erigeron peasei, commonly known as the Pease's blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the western regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in areas with well-drained soils. It produces small, blue to purple ray flowers surrounding a central disk, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Erigeron peasei is generally herbaceous, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that help it conserve moisture in its native environment."
