    "intro": "Elaphoglossum caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted water holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a compact, clustered growth habit with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to form dense mats. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in woodland gardens."
