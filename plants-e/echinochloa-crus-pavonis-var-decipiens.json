    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-pavonis var. decipiens, commonly known as the false brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural areas."
