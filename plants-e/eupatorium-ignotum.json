    "intro": "Eupatorium ignotum, commonly known as roughhead eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale purple, appearing in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium ignotum is valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various insects and birds."
