    "intro": "Euriples, commonly known as the European yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwest Africa. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries known as arils, which contain the seeds. Euriples has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its wood is prized for its durability and has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
