    "intro": "Ericameria nauseosa var. arta, commonly known as the Articulate ericameria, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow to orange-yellow composite flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often covered in fine hairs, and have a distinctive aromatic scent. Ericameria nauseosa var. arta is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
