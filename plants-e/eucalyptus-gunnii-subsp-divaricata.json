    "intro": "Eucalyptus gunnii subsp. divaricata, commonly known as the Tasmanian gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or grey. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and aromatic foliage."
