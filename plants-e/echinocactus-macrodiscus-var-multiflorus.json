    "intro": "Echinocactus macrodiscus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and rockeries."
