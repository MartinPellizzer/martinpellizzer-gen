    "intro": "Ellisia chrysanthemifolia, commonly known as the golden chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers range in color from yellow to orange, resembling chrysanthemums. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native habitat."
