    "intro": "Erinocarpus nimmoanus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed erinocarp, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The plant's unique fruit, which resembles a small, spiky capsule, is a distinctive feature and contains a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
