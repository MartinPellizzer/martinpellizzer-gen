    "intro": "Epidendrum villenae, commonly known as the Mexican Flame Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in less-than-ideal conditions. Epidendrum villenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care."
