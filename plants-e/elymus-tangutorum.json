    "intro": "Elymus tangutorum, commonly known as the Tibetan wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Elymus tangutorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats. Its seeds are also a valuable food source for various grazing animals."
