    "intro": "Euonymus europaeus f. maackii, commonly known as the European spindle tree or Maack's euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Europe. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. This form is a popular choice for hedges and garden borders because of its dense growth habit and year-round visual interest."
