    "intro": "Elymus mollis var. brevispicus, commonly known as the short-bracted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with short, bract-like structures that distinguish it from other varieties of Elymus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
