    "intro": "Epipremnum multicephalum, commonly known as the Marble Queen Philodendron, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are variegated with white and green patterns. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its stems can grow up to several meters long, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. Epipremnum multicephalum is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
