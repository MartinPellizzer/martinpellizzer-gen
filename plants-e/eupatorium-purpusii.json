    "intro": "Eupatorium purpusii, commonly known as the purple false dragonhead, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, lavender to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium purpusii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
