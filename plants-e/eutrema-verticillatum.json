    "intro": "Eutrema verticillatum, commonly known as the sea blush or seaside daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with small, white to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shorelines. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions makes it an important part of coastal ecosystems."
