    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. schubertiorum, commonly known as the Schubert's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and a single, showy, yellow-green flower with a distinctive, hooded lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its germination and nutrient uptake. This subspecies is notable for its morphological variation and is often confused with other members of the Epipactis genus."
