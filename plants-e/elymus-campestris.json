    "intro": "Elymus campestris, commonly known as the field barleygrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, often forming dense mats. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus campestris is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
