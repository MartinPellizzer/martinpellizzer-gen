    "intro": "Eremogone pulvinata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Eremogone pulvinata is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
