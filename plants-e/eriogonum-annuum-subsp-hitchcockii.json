    "intro": "Eriogonum annuum subsp. hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid regions."
