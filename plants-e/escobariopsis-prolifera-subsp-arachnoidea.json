    "intro": "Escobariopsis prolifera subsp. arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-like cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and a distinctive, web-like thallus with a yellowish to pale green color. The species is typically found on bark and rock surfaces in temperate and subtropical regions. It has a complex chemical composition, producing various secondary metabolites such as atranorin and chloroatranorin. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant lichen species."
