It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
