    "intro": "Epidendrum purpureocaulis, commonly known as the purple-stemmed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
