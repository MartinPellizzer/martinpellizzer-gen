    "intro": "Euporteria senilis, commonly known as the senile euporteria, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring deeply lobed and often serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences. Its fruits are generally small, round, and covered in a rough, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euporteria senilis is considered an endangered species in its native range."
