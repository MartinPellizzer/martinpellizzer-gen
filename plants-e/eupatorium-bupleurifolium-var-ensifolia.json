It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
