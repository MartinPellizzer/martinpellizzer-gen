    "intro": "Eugenia williamsii, commonly known as the Williams\u2019s guava, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but are less commonly consumed. Eugenia williamsii is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
