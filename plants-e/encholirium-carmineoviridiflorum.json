    "intro": "Encholirium carmineoviridiflorum, commonly known as the Carmine-green flowered lily, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that display a unique blend of carmine and green hues. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically borne on upright stems and bloom in the spring, adding a dramatic visual element to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
