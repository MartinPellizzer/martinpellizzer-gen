    "intro": "Eucalyptus gillenii, commonly known as the coastal eucalyptus, is a medium-sized tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. This species is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
