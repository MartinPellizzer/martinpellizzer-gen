It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a dense, white, woolly coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
