    "intro": "Epipactis muelleri var. saltuaria, commonly known as the salt marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears clusters of greenish-yellow to brownish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or muddy soils, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to saline environments through specialized root structures. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles, which are attracted to its strong, musty odor."
