It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat."
