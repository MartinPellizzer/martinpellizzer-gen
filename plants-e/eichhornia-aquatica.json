    "intro": "Eichhornia aquatica, commonly known as water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has vibrant purple flowers and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can grow rapidly, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are submerged, and it reproduces both sexually through seeds and vegetatively through runners. Water hyacinth is known for its ability to absorb heavy metals and nutrients from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
