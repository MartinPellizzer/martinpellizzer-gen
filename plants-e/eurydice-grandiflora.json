    "intro": "Eurydice grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered eurydice, is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its showy white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eurydice grandiflora is often found in shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
