    "intro": "Epidendrum vesicinanum, commonly known as the Red-tipped Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, arching stems that bear clusters of striking, red-tipped flowers. The plant typically produces showy, violet to purple blooms with a distinctive red or orange stripe along the lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum vesicinanum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
