    "intro": "Epidendrum splendens, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum splendens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
