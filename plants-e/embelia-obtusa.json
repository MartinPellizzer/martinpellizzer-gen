    "intro": "[WRONG START] Embilia obtusa, commonly known as the roughleaf embelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red as it matures. Embelia obtusa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported antimicrobial and antifungal properties."
