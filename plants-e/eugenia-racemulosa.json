    "intro": "Eugenia racemulosa, commonly known as the clustered eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 1-3 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit, a small, fleshy berry, is edible and often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Eugenia racemulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
