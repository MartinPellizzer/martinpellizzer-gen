    "intro": "Elizabetha oxyphylla, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Elizabetha oxyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
