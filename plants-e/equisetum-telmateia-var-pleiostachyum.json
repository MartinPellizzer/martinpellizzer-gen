It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in wetlands. Botanically, it is notable for its ancient lineage, belonging to one of the oldest groups of vascular plants."
