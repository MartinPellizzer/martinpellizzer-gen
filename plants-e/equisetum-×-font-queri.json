    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 font-queri, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum palustre. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures, typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are often visible in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
