    "intro": "Eriocaulon majusculum var. compositum, commonly known as the composite flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish colonies in suitable environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
