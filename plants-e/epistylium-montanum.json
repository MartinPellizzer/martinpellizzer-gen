    "intro": "Epistylium montanum, commonly known as the mountain epistylium, is a species of colonial freshwater algae belonging to the order Rhodophyceae. It forms dense, gelatinous colonies that float on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant's structure consists of a central axis with numerous branching filaments, each covered in tiny, photosynthetic cells. It thrives in nutrient-rich environments and is often found in mountain streams and lakes. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and ecological balance."
