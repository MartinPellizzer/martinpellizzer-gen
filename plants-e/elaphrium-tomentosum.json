    "intro": "Elaphrium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly elaphrium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Elaphrium tomentosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
