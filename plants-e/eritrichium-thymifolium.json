It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, early spring blooms. The plant features trifoliate leaves that resemble those of thyme, hence its common name. It produces small, yellow or white flowers that are often clustered in a single umbel. Eritrichium thymifolium thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
