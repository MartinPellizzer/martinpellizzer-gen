    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 schaffneri, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures, typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are often surrounded by a modified leaf called a sporophyll. Equisetum \u00d7 schaffneri is commonly found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions and is often considered an indicator of poor soil conditions. Due to its rapid growth and lack of seeds, it plays a role in ecological succession and soil stabilization."
