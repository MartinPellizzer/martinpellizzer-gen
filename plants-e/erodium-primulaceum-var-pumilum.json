    "intro": "Erodium primulaceum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf sticky weed, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or reddish flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become a weed in cultivated environments."
