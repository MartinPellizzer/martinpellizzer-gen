    "intro": "Epilobium hirsutum, commonly known as woolly willow or hairy willow, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, often boggy habitats, such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are small, five-petaled, and usually pink or reddish in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Epilobium hirsutum is known for its ability to thrive in wet environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
