    "intro": "Enkleia zippeliana, commonly known as the Zippel's enkleia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Enkleia zippeliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
