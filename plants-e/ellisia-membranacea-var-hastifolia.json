    "intro": "Ellisia membranacea var. hastifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ellisia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
