    "intro": "Euphrasia phragmostoma, commonly known as the marsh toadflax, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots often form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health."
