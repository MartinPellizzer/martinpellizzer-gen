    "intro": "Endonema, commonly known as the \"false nightshade,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their alternate, simple leaves and showy, often yellow or white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The fruits are usually berries or capsules, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals. Endonema species are generally not cultivated for food but are of interest in botanical studies due to their morphological diversity and ecological roles."
