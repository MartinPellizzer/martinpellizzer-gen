    "intro": "Eriocoma wallowaensis, commonly known as the Wallowa Mountains eriocoma, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevation regions of the Wallowa Mountains in Oregon, USA. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
