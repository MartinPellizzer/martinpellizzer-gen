    "intro": "Eulalia lagopus, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Eulalia lagopus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife."
