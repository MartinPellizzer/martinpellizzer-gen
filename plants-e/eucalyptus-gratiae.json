    "intro": "Eucalyptus gratiae, commonly known as the Graceful Gum, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to southeastern Australia, where it typically grows in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. The tree is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or grey. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses by Indigenous Australian communities."
