    "intro": "Exhalimolobos polyspermus, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the thin air at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
