    "intro": "Euphorbia anisopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. Euphorbia anisopetala is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
