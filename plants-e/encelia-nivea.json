    "intro": "Encelia nivea, commonly known as the white iceplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Encelia nivea is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and desert regions."
