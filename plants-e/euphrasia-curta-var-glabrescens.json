    "intro": "Euphrasia curta var. glabrescens, commonly known as the short euphrasia or the glabrous euphrasia, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has slender stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens tends to have fewer hairs as it matures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
