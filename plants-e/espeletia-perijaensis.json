It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. Espeletia perijaensis thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Its structure and flowering patterns make it an important component of the local biodiversity and a subject of botanical study."
