    "intro": "Euphorbia korovinii, commonly known as the Korovin's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Euphorbia korovinii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and resilience."
