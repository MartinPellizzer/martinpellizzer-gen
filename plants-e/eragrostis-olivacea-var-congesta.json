    "intro": "Eragrostis olivacea var. congesta, commonly known as the dense false brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
