    "intro": "Eriophorum chamissonis var. subalbidum, commonly known as the white-tipped tussock grass, is a variant of the tussock grass found in alpine and subalpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and dense, whitish to pale yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows and tundra environments. Its inflorescence consists of a central spike surrounded by bracts, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
