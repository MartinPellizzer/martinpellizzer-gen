    "intro": "Euphorbia scolopendrea, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia scolopendrea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
