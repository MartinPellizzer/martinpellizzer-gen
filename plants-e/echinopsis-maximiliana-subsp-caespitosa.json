    "intro": "Echinopsis maximiliana subsp. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered moon cactus, is a succulent cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit, with multiple stems forming a compact rosette. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers during the warm season, typically in spring or early summer. Its fleshy, spiny stems store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
