It features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. These flowers are followed by small, hairy fruits that mature in autumn. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
