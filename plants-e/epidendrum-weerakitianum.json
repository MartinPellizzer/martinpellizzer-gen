    "intro": "Epidendrum weerakitianum, commonly known as the Weerakiti orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces striking, showy inflorescences with multiple flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
