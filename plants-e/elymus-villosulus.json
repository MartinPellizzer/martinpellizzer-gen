    "intro": "Elymus villosulus, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of spikelets, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Elymus villosulus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
