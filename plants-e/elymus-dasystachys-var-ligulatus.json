    "intro": "Elymus dasystachys var. ligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
