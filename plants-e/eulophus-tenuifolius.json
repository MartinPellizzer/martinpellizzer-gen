    "intro": "Eulophus tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leafed eulophus, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Eulophus tenuifolius is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local pollinator populations."
