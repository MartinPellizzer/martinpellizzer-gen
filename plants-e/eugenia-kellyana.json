It is native to Australia and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Eugenia kellyana is typically found in coastal regions and is adapted to sandy soils and salty sea air."
