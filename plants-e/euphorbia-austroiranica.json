    "intro": "Euphorbia austroiranica, commonly known as the Iranian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
