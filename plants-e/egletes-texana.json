    "intro": "Egletes texana, commonly known as the Texas horned lark, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Egletes texana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
