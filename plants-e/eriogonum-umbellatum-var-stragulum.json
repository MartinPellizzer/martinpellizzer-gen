    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. stragulum, commonly known as the longstem buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments."
