    "intro": "Eritrichium capituliflorum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a compact, head-like inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Eritrichium capituliflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
