    "intro": "Euonymus japonicus var. reticulatus, commonly known as Japanese spurge or reticulate euonymus, is a perennial shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with a distinctive reticulated pattern on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are ornamental. It is often cultivated as a ground cover or hedge due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
