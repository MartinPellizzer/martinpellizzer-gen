    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. taikankoense, commonly known as the Japanese horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait common to its ancient lineage. Its structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary history as a relic from the Paleozoic era."
