    "intro": "Eupatorium perfoliatum f. truncatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed boneset, is a variant of the boneset plant native to North America. It is characterized by its shorter stature and truncate (cut-off) leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form of Eupatorium perfoliatum. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Asteraceae family."
