    "intro": "Erigeron viscosus, commonly known as sticky blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically blue to purple, with ray florets that give it a daisy-like appearance. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and roadsides."
