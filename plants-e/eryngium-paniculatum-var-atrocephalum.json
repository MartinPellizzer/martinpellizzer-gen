    "intro": "Eryngium paniculatum var. atrocephalum, commonly known as black-headed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and showy purple to violet flower heads. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in wetland and moist woodland habitats. The plant features a robust root system and produces a tall, branching stem with dense, bract-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flower heads consist of numerous small florets, with the central disk being dark purple or black, giving it its common name. The plant is adapted to moist environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks."
