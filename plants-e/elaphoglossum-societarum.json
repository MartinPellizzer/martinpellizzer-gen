    "intro": "Elaphoglossum societarum, commonly known as the society fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending in growth habit. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. Elaphoglossum societarum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological studies and horticultural interest."
