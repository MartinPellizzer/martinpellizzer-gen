    "intro": "Eucalyptus tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and smooth, often aromatic bark. The plant produces small white or pink flowers, typically in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus tenella is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Its resilience to drought and ability to regenerate after fire make it a valuable component of its native ecosystem."
