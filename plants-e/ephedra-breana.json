    "intro": "Ephedra breana, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Ephedra breana is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. It is considered an important species in the study of desert flora due to its unique adaptations to extreme conditions."
