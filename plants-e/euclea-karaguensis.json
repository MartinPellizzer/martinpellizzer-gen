    "intro": "Euclea karaguensis, commonly known as the Karagwe euclea, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
