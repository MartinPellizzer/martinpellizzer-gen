It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light. Epidendrum kirkbridei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable growing environment."
