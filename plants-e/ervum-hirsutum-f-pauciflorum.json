    "intro": "Ervum hirsutum f. pauciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered hairy vetch, is a variant of the hairy vetch species native to Europe. It is characterized by its reduced flower count compared to the typical form, with fewer, smaller blossoms that often appear in clusters. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in sustainable gardening practices."
