    "intro": "Epilobium angustifolium f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a variant of the narrow-leaved willow herb. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America, characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its flowers are pink to reddish-purple, with five petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The pubescent (hairy) foliage distinguishes this form from the typical variety, contributing to its ecological and horticultural significance."
