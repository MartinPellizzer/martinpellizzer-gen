    "intro": "Eugenia rugosa var. saxitana, commonly known as the saxitana variant of the rough eugenia, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
