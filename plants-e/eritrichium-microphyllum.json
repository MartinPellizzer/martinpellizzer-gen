    "intro": "Eritrichium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a dense mat of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are small and spoon-shaped, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a characteristic species of high-elevation ecosystems."
