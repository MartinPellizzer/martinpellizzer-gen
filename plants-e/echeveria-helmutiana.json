It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray or silver in color, with a powdery coating known as bloom. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
