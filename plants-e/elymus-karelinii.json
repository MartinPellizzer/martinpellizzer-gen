    "intro": "Elymus karelinii, commonly known as the Karelin's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces panicles of spikelets that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Elymus karelinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in semi-arid environments."
