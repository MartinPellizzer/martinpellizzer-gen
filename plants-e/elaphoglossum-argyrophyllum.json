    "intro": "Elaphoglossum argyrophyllum, commonly known as the silver-veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a silvery or pale green hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and the spores are released during the wet season. Elaphoglossum argyrophyllum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
