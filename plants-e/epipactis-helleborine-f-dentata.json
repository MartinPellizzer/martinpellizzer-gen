    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine f. dentata, commonly known as the toothed helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and a distinctive, showy inflorescence with yellow-green flowers that have a prominent, spurred lip. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It reproduces through seeds and also spreads vegetatively via rhizomes. The toothed helleborine is an epipetalous orchid, meaning its flowers are attached to the leaves rather than the stem."
