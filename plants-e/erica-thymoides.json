    "intro": "Erica thymoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica thymoides is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
