    "intro": "Euphorbia papillosa var. erythrorrhiza, commonly known as the red-rooted milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem with a reddish hue, and its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
