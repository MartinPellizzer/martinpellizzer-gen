    "intro": "Encelia nudicaulis, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its structure includes a woody stem with numerous branches, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Encelia nudicaulis is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small animals."
