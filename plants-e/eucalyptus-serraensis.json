    "intro": "Eucalyptus serraensis, commonly known as the serrated eucalyptus, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale green, attracting various pollinators. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, a common feature among eucalyptus species. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in forested highlands."
