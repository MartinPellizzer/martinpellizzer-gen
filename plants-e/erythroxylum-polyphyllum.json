    "intro": "Erythroxylum polyphyllum, commonly known as the Andean coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into several lobes, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces small, round berries that contain elliptical seeds. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in the production of coca leaves, it holds cultural and economic significance in the Andes."
