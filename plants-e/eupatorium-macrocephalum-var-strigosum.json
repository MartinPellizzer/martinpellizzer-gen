It features tall, sturdy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish-brown color. The plant produces large, showy, pale blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
