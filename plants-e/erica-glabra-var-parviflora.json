    "intro": "Erica glabra var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral displays. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or coastal environments."
