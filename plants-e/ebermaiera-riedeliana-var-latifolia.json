    "intro": "Ebermaiera riedeliana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed ebermaiera, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its broad, lanceolate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
