    "intro": "Eucalyptus fulgens, commonly known as the crimson gum, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that reveals a striking pinkish or reddish hue. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish-green color with a white underside. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
