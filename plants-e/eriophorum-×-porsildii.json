    "intro": "Eriophorum \u00d7 porsildii, commonly known as the hybrid tussock sedge, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wetland habitats. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in fragile ecosystems. Eriophorum \u00d7 porsildii is a composite species resulting from the cross between Eriophorum angustifolium and Eriophorum vaginatum."
