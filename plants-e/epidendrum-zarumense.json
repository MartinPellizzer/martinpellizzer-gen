    "intro": "Epidendrum zarumense, commonly known as the Zarumense Orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a sympodial orchid with a short, creeping rhizome and produces multiple pseudobulbs that are covered in a dense layer of white to pale green roots. The plant typically blooms with clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a compact rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Epidendrum zarumense is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability to various light conditions and its ability to thrive in well-draining potting media."
