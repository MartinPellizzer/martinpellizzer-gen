    "intro": "Elatostema pauperatum, commonly known as the poor man's elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle and related species, and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Elatostema pauperatum produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often accompanied by stinging hairs similar to those found in nettles."
