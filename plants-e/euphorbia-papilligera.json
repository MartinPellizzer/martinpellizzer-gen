    "intro": "Euphorbia papilligera, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia papilligera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
