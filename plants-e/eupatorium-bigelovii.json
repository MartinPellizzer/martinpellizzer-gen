    "intro": "Eupatorium bigelovii, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while its stems are erect and sometimes branched. Eupatorium bigelovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
