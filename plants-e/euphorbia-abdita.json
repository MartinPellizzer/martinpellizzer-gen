    "intro": "Euphorbia abdita, commonly known as the Abyssinian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia abdita is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
