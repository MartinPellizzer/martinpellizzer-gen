    "intro": "Eriocaulon lhotskyi, commonly known as the Lhotsky's spike-moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and slender, leafy stems that often form compact cushions. The leaves are typically narrow, linear, and arranged in a spiral, with a smooth or slightly rough surface. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on moss morphology and ecological adaptation."
