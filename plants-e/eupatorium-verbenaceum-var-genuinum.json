    "intro": "Eupatorium verbenaceum var. genuinum, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and moist soils in the eastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct veining pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom in late summer. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in swampy areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a potential source of medicinal compounds."
