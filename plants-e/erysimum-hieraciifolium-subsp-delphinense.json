    "intro": "Erysimum hieraciifolium subsp. delphinense, commonly known as the Delphinium-leaved Wallflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of delphinium species. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
