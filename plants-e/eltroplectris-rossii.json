It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a compact rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Eltroplectris rossii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
