    "intro": "Epidendrum belizense, commonly known as the Belize orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright indirect light. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and conservation efforts."
