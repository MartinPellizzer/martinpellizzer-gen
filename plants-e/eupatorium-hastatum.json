    "intro": "Eupatorium hastatum, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that often grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to wetland environments. Eupatorium hastatum plays an important ecological role in supporting native wildlife and stabilizing moist soil."
