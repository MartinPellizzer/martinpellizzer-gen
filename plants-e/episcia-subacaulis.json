    "intro": "Episcia subacaulis, commonly known as the miniature wax plant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the humid forests of Central and South America. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. Its flowers are typically showy, with vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow, and are borne on short, erect stems. Episcia subacaulis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish."
