    "intro": "Elatine alsinastrum f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating waterwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, with small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in some areas."
