    "intro": "Enarthrocarpus strangulatus var. vaccarii, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
