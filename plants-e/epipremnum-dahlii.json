    "intro": "Epipremnum dahlii, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that often exhibit a striking yellow or variegated pattern. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, warm environments. Its aerial roots allow it to anchor itself to surfaces as it climbs, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Epipremnum dahlii is known for its adaptability and low maintenance requirements, making it an ideal plant for both novice and experienced growers."
