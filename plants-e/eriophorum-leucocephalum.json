    "intro": "Eriophorum leucocephalum, commonly known as cotton grass, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Cotton grass is often used as an indicator species for wetland habitats due to its specific ecological requirements."
