    "intro": "Euphorbia platyphyllos var. succulenta, commonly known as the flat-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
