    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides var. chaixiana, commonly known as the Chaix's spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features a rosette of gray-green, succulent leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by a crown of red bracts, which are often the only visible part of the inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
