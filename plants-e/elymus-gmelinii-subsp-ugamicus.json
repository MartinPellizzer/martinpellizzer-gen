    "intro": "Elymus gmelinii subsp. ugamicus, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the steppes and semi-desert regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spikelet clusters that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural purposes."
