    "intro": "Eustrephus latifolius subsp. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lanceolate, typically narrower than those of the broader-leaved subspecies. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
