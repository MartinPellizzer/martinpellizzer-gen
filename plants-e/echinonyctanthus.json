    "intro": "Echinonyctanthus, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of a single species, Echinonyctanthus aculeatus, which is native to the Andean regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its woody shrub form, with elliptical leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom at night. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful to animals and humans. Despite its toxicity, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
