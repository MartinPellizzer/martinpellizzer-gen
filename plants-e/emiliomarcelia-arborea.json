    "intro": "Emiliomarcelia arborea, commonly known as the goldenleaf tree, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that display a striking golden hue under sunlight. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by specific species of bees. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss, Emiliomarcelia arborea is currently listed as endangered."
