    "intro": "Erigeron blochmaniae, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
