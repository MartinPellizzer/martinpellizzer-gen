    "intro": "Eranthis lobulata var. elatior, commonly known as the Greater Crown Vetch, is a deciduous perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features erect, branched stems that bear opposite, trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes. The plant produces bright yellow, spurred flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a useful plant for soil stabilization and reclamation projects."
