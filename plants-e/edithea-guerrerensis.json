    "intro": "Edithea guerrerensis, commonly known as the Guerrerense orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, terrestrial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are often pale green or white with subtle markings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
