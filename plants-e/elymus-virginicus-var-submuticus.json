    "intro": "Elymus virginicus var. submuticus, commonly known as the smooth fieldgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
