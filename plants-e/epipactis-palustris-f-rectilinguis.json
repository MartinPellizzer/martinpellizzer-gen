    "intro": "Epipactis palustris f. rectilinguis, commonly known as the straight-leaf marsh helleborine, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique lip structure that aids in pollination. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
