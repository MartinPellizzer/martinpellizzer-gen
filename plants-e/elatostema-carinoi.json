It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Elatostema carinoi is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
