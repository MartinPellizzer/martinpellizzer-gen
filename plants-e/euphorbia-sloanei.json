    "intro": "Euphorbia sloanei, commonly known as the Sloane's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with spiny, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution. Euphorbia sloanei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
