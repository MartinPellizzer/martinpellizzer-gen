    "intro": "Erica pusilla var. micranthera, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
