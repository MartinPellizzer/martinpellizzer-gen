    "intro": "Euonymus repens, commonly known as creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces tiny, four-petaled yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ground cover due to its dense growth habit. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate shade."
