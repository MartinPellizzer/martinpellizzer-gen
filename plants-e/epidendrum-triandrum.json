    "intro": "Epidendrum triandrum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Gods, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and leathery, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Epidendrum triandrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
