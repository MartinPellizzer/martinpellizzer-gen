    "intro": "Euphorbia porteriana var. keyensis, commonly known as Key Island spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Florida Keys. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
