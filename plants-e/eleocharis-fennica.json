    "intro": "Eleocharis fennica, commonly known as the Fennoscandian spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or muddy habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched and bear small, spike-like clusters of greenish flowers. Its leaves are grass-like and often reduced to narrow, sheathing structures at the base of the stem. Eleocharis fennica plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
