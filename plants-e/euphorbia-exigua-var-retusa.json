It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes hairy, while its stems are erect and branching. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
