It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and distinctive yellowish-white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of tropical flora and biodiversity. The plant is also valued for its potential medicinal properties and ecological significance in its native habitat."
