    "intro": "Eucalyptus nitens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallet tree, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white bloom. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, peeling in thin, flaky layers as the tree matures. Eucalyptus nitens is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in forest and woodland habitats."
