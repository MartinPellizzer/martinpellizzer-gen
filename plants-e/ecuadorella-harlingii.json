    "intro": "Ecuadorella harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, high-altitude environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ecuadorella harlingii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
