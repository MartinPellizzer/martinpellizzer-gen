    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 stephensonii, commonly known as the Stephenson's helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological niche. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations that make it challenging to classify taxonomically."
