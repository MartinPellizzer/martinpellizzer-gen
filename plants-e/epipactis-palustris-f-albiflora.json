    "intro": "Epipactis palustris f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial with lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's inflorescence typically consists of a single, elongated spike bearing several flowers, which are often adorned with a greenish or brownish lip. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and a unique morphology adapted to its moist, often shaded environment. This form is distinguished by its pale floral coloration, which sets it apart from the more typical greenish or brownish flowers of the main species."
