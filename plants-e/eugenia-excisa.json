    "intro": "Eugenia excisa, commonly known as the velvetleaf guava, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often velvety to the touch, and its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round, dark purple to black fruits that are edible and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Eugenia excisa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine."
