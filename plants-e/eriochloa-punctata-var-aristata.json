It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value is limited, but it plays a role in stabilizing soil in native habitats."
