    "intro": "Epidendrum corymborkiphyllum, commonly known as the orchid with the crown-like inflorescence, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces dense clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media."
