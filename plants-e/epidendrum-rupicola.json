    "intro": "Epidendrum rupicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
