    "intro": "Euphorbia cameronii, commonly known as Cameron's spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico. It features a thick, fleshy stem and produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. The plant has adapted to survive in dry environments with its ability to store water in its stems and leaves. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia cameronii is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
