    "intro": "Euphorbia frankii, commonly known as the Frank's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia frankii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. It is also noted for its ability to store water in its stems, aiding in its survival in harsh conditions."
