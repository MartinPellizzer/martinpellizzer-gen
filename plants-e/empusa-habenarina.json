    "intro": "Empusa habenarina, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically a mix of white, purple, and pink hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid rainforest canopy. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, which is unusual for many orchid species. The plant's botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and its role in the unique ecosystems of Madagascar."
