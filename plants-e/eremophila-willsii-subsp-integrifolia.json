    "intro": "Eremophila willsii subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its grey-green, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to red, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in low-water environments. This species is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
