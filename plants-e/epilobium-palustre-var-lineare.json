    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. lineare, commonly known as the linear willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clustered racemes, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet environments. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
