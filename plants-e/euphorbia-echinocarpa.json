    "intro": "Euphorbia echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiny milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in small, spiny projections. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It stores water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments. The sap of Euphorbia echinocarpa is milky and can be toxic if ingested."
