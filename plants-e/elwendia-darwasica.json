    "intro": "Elwendia darwasica, commonly known as the Darwasic flamebloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Darwas Mountains. It is characterized by its striking red-orange petals that resemble flames, which bloom during the short summer season. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with woody stems that become more pronounced with age. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess sunlight. Elwendia darwasica is adapted to harsh, cold climates and requires specific soil conditions to thrive."
