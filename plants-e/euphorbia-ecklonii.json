    "intro": "Euphorbia ecklonii, commonly known as the Cape spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick, woody stem with numerous branches that are covered in small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia ecklonii is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
