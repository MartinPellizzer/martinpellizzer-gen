    "intro": "Eupatorium asperrimum var. gardneri, commonly known as rough eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, appearing in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
