    "intro": "Eucalyptus effusa subsp. effusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing small, brown seeds. This subspecies is known for its hardy nature and is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
