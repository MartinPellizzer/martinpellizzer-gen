    "intro": "Ebenus barbigera var. hirsutifolia, commonly known as the hairy euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in xerophytic gardens."
