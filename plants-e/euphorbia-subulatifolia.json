    "intro": "Euphorbia subulatifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, low-growing form with dense clusters of narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
