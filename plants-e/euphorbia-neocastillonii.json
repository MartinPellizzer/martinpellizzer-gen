    "intro": "Euphorbia neocastillonii, commonly known as the Castillon's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia neocastillonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
