    "intro": "Elaeis guineensis var. microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf oil palm, is a variant of the oil palm native to West Africa. It is characterized by its smaller fruit size and reduced seed mass compared to the standard Elaeis guineensis. The plant produces an oil-rich fruit, which is used for both culinary and industrial purposes. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. Due to its compact size, it is often cultivated in smaller spaces and is valued for its productivity in limited areas."
