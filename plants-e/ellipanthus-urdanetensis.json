    "intro": "Ellipanthus urdanetensis, commonly known as the Urda net grass, is a rare flowering plant native to Venezuela. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
