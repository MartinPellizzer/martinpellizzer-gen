    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ovalilimbatum, commonly known as the oval-lobed holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and are protected by a small, kidney-shaped indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
