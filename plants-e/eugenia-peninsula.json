    "intro": "Eugenia peninsula, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible for some bird species but not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along waterways. The Florida holly is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
