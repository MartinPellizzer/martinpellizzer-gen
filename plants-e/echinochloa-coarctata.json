    "intro": "Echinochloa coarctata, commonly known as rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. Echinochloa coarctata is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
