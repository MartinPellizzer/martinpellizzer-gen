    "intro": "Elaphoglossum skottsbergii, commonly known as the Skottsberg's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in linear rows on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum skottsbergii is native to regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador."
