    "intro": "Eugenia floccosa, commonly known as the woolly wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties. Eugenia floccosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and humid forest environments."
