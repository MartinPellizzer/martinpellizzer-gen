It is characterized by its dense, floating foliage composed of narrow, dark green leaves that form a thick mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate floral display to its aquatic habitat. It thrives in warm, still waters with moderate to high light exposure. This variety is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
