It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that can grow up to several inches in length. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique foliage and floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
