It features small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open meadows and along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its role in local ecosystems."
