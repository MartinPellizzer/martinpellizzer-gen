    "intro": "Eugenia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas. Eugenia mollis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some culinary uses in local traditions."
