    "intro": "Euphorbia leucotricha, commonly known as the white-hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
