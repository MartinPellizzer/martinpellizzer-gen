    "intro": "Erica oligantha, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Erica oligantha is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
