It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
