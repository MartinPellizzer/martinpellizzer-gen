It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and seasonal blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical gardens."
