    "intro": "Euphorbia complanata, commonly known as the flatleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and smooth, often gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap is milky and can be toxic, containing irritants that may cause skin irritation. Euphorbia complanata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
