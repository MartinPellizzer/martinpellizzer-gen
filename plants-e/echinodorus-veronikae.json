It is characterized by its broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. This plant thrives in freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to oxygenate the water. Echinodorus veronikae prefers moderate to high light conditions and can tolerate a range of water temperatures. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense underwater foliage."
