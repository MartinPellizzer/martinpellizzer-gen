    "intro": "Elytrigia repens var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered with short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
