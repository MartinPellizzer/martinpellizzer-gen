    "intro": "Edraianthus kitaibelii var. subalpinus, commonly known as the Alpine edraianthus, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to cold, harsh climates. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller stature and more compact growth compared to other varieties of Edraianthus."
