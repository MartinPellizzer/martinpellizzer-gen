It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and as a houseplant."
