    "intro": "Eriosyce curvispina var. tuberisulcata, commonly known as the tuberous sulcate eriosyce, is a species of cactus native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a succulent structure that helps it store water in arid environments. This variety is noted for its distinctive tubercles and sulcate (grooved) surface on its stem."
