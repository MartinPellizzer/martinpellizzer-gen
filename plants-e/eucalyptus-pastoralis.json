    "intro": "Eucalyptus pastoralis, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that ranges from grey to brown in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
