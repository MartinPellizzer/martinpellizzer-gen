    "intro": "Epidendrum punense, commonly known as the Punta del Este orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Brazil and Argentina. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with contrasting patterns. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, helping it store water in its natural habitat. Epidendrum punense thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
