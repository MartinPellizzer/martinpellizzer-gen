    "intro": "Euphorbia depauperata var. tsetserrensis, commonly known as the Desert Rose or Tsetserren's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the rainy season, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are often reduced to small, spiny structures, and it is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. This species is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
