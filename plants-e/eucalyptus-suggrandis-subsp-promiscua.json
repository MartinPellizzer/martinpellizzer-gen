    "intro": "Eucalyptus suggrandis subsp. promiscua, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing some degree of frost tolerance. This subspecies is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
