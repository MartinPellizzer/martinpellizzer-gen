It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, often exuding a fragrant resin. Elaeocarpus ovalifolius is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
