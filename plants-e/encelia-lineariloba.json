    "intro": "Encelia lineariloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf encelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its linear, narrow leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Encelia lineariloba is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
