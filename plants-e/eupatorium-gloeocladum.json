    "intro": "Eupatorium gloeocladum, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Eupatorium gloeocladum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
