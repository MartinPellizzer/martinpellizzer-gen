    "intro": "Eugenia littorea, commonly known as the coastal eucalyptus, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale pink or white, followed by edible, fleshy berries. Eugenia littorea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tidal zones and mangrove forests. Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
