    "intro": "Eriophorum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while the flowering stems rise above the foliage. Eriophorum japonicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
