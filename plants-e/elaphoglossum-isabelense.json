    "intro": "Elaphoglossum isabelense, commonly known as the Isabel's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often densely packed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive harts-tongue shape at the base, giving it its common name. Elaphoglossum isabelense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
