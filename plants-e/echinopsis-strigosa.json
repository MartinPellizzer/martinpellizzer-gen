    "intro": "Echinopsis strigosa, commonly known as the \"Crested Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Echinopsis strigosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh conditions."
