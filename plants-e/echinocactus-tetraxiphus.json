    "intro": "Echinocactus tetraxiphus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival in arid conditions. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry environments."
