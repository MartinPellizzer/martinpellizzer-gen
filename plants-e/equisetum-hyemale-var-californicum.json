    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. californicum, commonly known as the California horse tail, is a perennial fern-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, spore-bearing cones and a central, unbranched stem. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and stream banks. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its structure resembles that of ancient plants from the Carboniferous period. The species is notable for its lack of true leaves and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
