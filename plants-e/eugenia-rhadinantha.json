    "intro": "Eugenia rhadinantha, commonly known as the pink-flowered eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Eugenia rhadinantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
