    "intro": "Equisetum limosum var. nudum, commonly known as the naked horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that lacks the typical fertile stems found in other varieties. It is a perennial plant native to wetlands and moist soils in temperate regions. The plant features jointed, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. Its leaves are reduced to whorls of small, needle-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
