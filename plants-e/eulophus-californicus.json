    "intro": "Eulophus californicus, commonly known as the California lacewing, is a small parasitic wasp that plays a significant role in biological control. It is native to the western United States and is often found in agricultural and natural habitats. The adult wasp has delicate, transparent wings and a slender body, typical of the family Chalcididae. Its larvae parasitize various insect pests, contributing to natural pest management. Botanically, it is associated with a range of host plants where its host insects feed, making it an important component of ecosystem dynamics."
