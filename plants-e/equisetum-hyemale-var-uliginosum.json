    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. uliginosum, commonly known as the swamp horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that thrives in wet, boggy environments. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found near the soil surface. It has a distinctive appearance with a lack of true leaves, relying instead on whorls of small, needle-like structures. This variety is often found in moist, acidic soils and is an indicator species for wetland habitats."
