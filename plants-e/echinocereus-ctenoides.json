    "intro": "Echinocereus ctenoides, commonly known as the teddy bear cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white flowers during the spring. The plant has a dense, branching structure that forms a shrub-like appearance, and its stems are typically green with a powdery coating. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and producing showy blooms to attract pollinators. The teddy bear cholla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
