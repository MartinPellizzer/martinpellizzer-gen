    "intro": "Epidendrum henrici, commonly known as the Henry's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and often produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically features broad, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum henrici is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
