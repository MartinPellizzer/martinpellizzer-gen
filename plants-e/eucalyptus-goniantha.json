    "intro": "Eucalyptus goniantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in strips, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. Eucalyptus goniantha is adapted to arid conditions and plays an important role in its native ecosystem."
