    "intro": "Eupatorium lavandulifolium, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that resemble mist. The plant has aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often fragrant when crushed, giving it a lavender-like scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Eupatorium lavandulifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
