    "intro": "Echinocereus perbellus, commonly known as the bright red cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in bright red spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and bats. It is a drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Echinocereus perbellus is also known for its ability to store water in its succulent stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments."
