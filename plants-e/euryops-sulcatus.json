    "intro": "Euryops sulcatus, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bract-like structures that surround the flower heads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Euryops sulcatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to attract pollinators."
