    "intro": "Espeletia ulotricha, commonly known as the \"Puya ulotricha,\" is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette, often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean cloud forests. Espeletia ulotricha plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar to various pollinators, including hummingbirds and bees."
