    "intro": "Elephantorrhiza woodii, commonly known as the Natal grass or elephant's grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and dense, fibrous growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense stands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
