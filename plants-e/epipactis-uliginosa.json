    "intro": "Epipactis uliginosa, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often found in bogs and marshes. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. Epipactis uliginosa is a protected species in many regions due to its ecological significance and declining habitat."
