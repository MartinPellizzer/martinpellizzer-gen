    "intro": "Echinocereus barthelowianus, commonly known as the Bartholomew's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, spineless plant that typically grows to a height of about 10 inches, featuring a globular or cylindrical stem covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and is considered a popular ornamental plant."
