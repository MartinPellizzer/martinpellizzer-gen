    "intro": "Epidendrum aurigineum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum aurigineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
