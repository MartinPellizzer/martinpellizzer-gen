    "intro": "Erodium chium var. typicum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is an annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive, three-lobed shape, often dispersed by wind. Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and can become a weed in agricultural settings."
