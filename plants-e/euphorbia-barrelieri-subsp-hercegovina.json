    "intro": "Euphorbia barrelieri subsp. hercegovina, commonly known as the Hercegova\u0144a spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rocky soils. Its thick, water-storing stems help it survive in dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
