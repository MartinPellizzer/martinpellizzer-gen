    "intro": "Erycina glossomystax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
