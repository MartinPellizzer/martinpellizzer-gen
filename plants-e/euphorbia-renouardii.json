    "intro": "Euphorbia renouardii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, which is a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested or contacted with skin. Euphorbia renouardii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
