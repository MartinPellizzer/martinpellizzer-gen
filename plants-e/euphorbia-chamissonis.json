    "intro": "Euphorbia chamissonis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, spiny stems and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with its thick leaves and water-storing tissues. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. Euphorbia chamissonis is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional uses."
