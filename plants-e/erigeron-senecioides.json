    "intro": "Erigeron senecioides, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
