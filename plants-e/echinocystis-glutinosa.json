    "intro": "Echinocystis glutinosa, commonly known as sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and produces showy yellow flowers with prominent white markings. The plant is notable for its sticky, resinous secretions that cover its stems and leaves, which can adhere to animals and clothing. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that contains several small, toxic seeds. Echinocystis glutinosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
