    "intro": "Eragrostis cognata, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
