    "intro": "Euphorbia paniculata subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces a milky latex when damaged. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
