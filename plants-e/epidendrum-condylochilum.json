    "intro": "Epidendrum condylochilum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and using them for support rather than nutrients. Its leaves are usually broad and glossy, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
