    "intro": "Eucalyptus dealbata var. chloroclada, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a variant of the ghost gum species native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to greyish bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-green hue, which distinguishes it from other eucalyptus varieties. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
