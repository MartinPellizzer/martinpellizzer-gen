    "intro": "Euphorbia platyphyllos var. subciliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
