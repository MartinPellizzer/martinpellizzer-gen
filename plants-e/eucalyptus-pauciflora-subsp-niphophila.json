    "intro": "Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. niphophila, commonly known as the snow gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and silver-blue foliage that helps it withstand cold and snowy conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its bark is fibrous and peels away in thin layers, revealing a smooth, pale inner bark. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
