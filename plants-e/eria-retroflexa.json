    "intro": "Eria retroflexa, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-tipped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree trunks without being parasitic. Eria retroflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
