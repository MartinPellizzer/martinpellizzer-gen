It is characterized by its distinctive yellow leaves, which contrast with its dark green stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red, inflated seed capsules that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage makes it a valuable addition to landscape designs, especially in shaded areas."
