    "intro": "Epithema madulidii, commonly known as the Madulid's epiphyte, is a unique bromeliad native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and provide protection against intense sunlight. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Epithema madulidii plays a vital ecological role in its habitat by providing microhabitats for various invertebrates and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
