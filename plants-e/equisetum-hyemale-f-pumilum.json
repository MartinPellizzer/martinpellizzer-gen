    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale f. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf scouring rush, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are distinctive in appearance. This variety is smaller than the typical Equisetum hyemale, with shorter and more compact growth."
