    "intro": "Eucalyptus nubilis, commonly known as the misty gum, is a tall, slender tree native to the wetter coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous underlayer, and its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are typically pale green and covered in a fine, white bloom. The tree produces small, globular clusters of white or cream flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its essential oils, rich in eucalyptol, are widely used in medicinal and aromatic applications. The species is adapted to humid climates and is often found in rainforest or coastal scrub habitats."
