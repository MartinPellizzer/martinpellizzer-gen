    "intro": "Epidendrum cnemidophorum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom sequentially along the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements."
