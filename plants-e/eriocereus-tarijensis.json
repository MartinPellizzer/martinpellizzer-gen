    "intro": "Eriocereus tarijensis, commonly known as the Tarijensis night-blooming cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly in Bolivia and Peru. It is a flowering cactus characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. Its nocturnal blooming habit is an adaptation to avoid daytime heat and attract specific pollinators. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
