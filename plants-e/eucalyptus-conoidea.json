    "intro": "Eucalyptus conoidea, commonly known as the conical eucalyptus, is a species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and conical shape, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale green. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, fibrous texture. Eucalyptus conoidea is adapted to arid environments and is often found in open woodlands or on rocky outcrops."
