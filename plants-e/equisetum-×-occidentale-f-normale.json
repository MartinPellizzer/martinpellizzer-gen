    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 occidentale f. normale, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a hybrid fern-like plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum \u00d7 occidentale and Equisetum normale. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands and along streambanks. The plant features whorled, needle-like leaves that are jointed and contain silica, giving them a rough, abrasive texture. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique, ancient-looking foliage."
