    "intro": "Eritrichium delicatulum, commonly known as the slender alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Asia and North America. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Eritrichium delicatulum is often found in rocky meadows and alpine tundra, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these harsh ecosystems."
