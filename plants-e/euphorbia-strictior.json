    "intro": "Euphorbia strictior, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
