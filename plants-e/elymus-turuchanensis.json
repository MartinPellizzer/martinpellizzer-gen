    "intro": "Elymus turuchanensis, commonly known as the Turuchan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, tufted growth habit, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with narrow, blade-like leaves that are adapted to cold climates. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh environments. Elymus turuchanensis is well-suited to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
