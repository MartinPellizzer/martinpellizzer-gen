    "intro": "Ephemerantha poilanei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that bloom briefly and often in the shade of the forest canopy. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction and its secretive nature, Ephemerantha poilanei is considered a critically endangered species."
