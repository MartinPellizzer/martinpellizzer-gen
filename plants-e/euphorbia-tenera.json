    "intro": "Euphorbia tenera, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
