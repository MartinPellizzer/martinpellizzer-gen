    "intro": "Eriocaulon arenarium, commonly known as sand spikerush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or muddy substrates near the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant has slender, erect stems with whorled leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriocaulon arenarium is adapted to brackish or saline conditions, making it a characteristic species of estuarine and tidal wetlands."
