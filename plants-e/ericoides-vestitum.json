    "intro": "Ericoides vestitum, commonly known as the velvet heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the wet, acidic soils of the Pacific Northwest. It features small, leathery leaves that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Ericoides vestitum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
