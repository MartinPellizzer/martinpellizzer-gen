It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are schizocarps, releasing small, kidney-shaped seeds when mature. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields."
