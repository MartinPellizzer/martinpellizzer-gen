    "intro": "Evolvulus glomeratus subsp. euglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are heart-shaped with a serrated margin. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, a trait typical of many morning glory species. The subspecies euglomeratus is distinguished by its more densely clustered inflorescences compared to other subspecies of Evolvulus glomeratus."
