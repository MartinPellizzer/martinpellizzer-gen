    "intro": "Eriocaulon capillus-naiadis, commonly known as water stargrass, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its roots help stabilize the sediment, contributing to water clarity and habitat for aquatic life. Eriocaulon capillus-naiadis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
