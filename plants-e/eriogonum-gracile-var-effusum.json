It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control in arid environments."
