    "intro": "Eulophia abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Ethiopia. It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It is often found in rocky or semi-desert environments, adapting to poor soil conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
