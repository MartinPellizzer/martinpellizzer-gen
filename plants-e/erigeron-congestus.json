It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous small white to pale blue flowers.
