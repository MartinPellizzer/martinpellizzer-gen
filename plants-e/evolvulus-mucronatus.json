It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a trailing vine that produces small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for garden use, though it can be invasive in some regions."
