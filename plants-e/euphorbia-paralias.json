It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant features erect, branched stems covered in small, spiny structures called glands. Its flowers are clustered in yellowish-green cyathia, which are modified inflorescences. Euphorbia paralias is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species found in harsh maritime environments."
