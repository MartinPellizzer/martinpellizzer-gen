    "intro": "Elaphoglossum albescens, commonly known as the white-veined holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, dark green fronds with pale, whitish veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum albescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
