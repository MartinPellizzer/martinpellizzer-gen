    "intro": "Euphorbia carinthiaca, commonly known as the Carpathian spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters called cyathia, surrounded by colorful bracts that give it a striking appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Euphorbia carinthiaca is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
