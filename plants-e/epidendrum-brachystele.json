    "intro": "Epidendrum brachystele, commonly known as the short-stemmed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments."
