    "intro": "Eucalyptus globoidea, commonly known as the globular eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive globular shape and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. Eucalyptus globoidea is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
