    "intro": "Endiandra leptodendron, commonly known as the slender-leaved endiandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
