    "intro": "Epidendrum ellemanniae, commonly known as the Ellemann's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant, colorful flowers that can range from red to orange and yellow. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it capture moisture from the air. Epidendrum ellemanniae is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
