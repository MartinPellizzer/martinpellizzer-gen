    "intro": "Eritrichium sachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin flea bean, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of pink or white. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
