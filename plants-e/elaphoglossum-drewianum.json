    "intro": "Elaphoglossum drewianum, commonly known as the Drew's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive in partial shade. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum drewianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
