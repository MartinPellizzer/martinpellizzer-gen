It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are densely packed and covered with short, smooth awns. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
