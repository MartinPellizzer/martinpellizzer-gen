    "intro": "Echites brachystachyus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed echites, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echites brachystachyus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
