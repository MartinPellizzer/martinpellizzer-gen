    "intro": "Eriocaulon nanellum, commonly known as the small spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in wetland environments. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in temperate to tropical climates. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny white or pale green flowers, which are often difficult to see. Eriocaulon nanellum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
