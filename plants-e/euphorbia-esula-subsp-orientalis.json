    "intro": "Euphorbia esula subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental leaf spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the summer. The plant has smooth, often ribbed stems and alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
