    "intro": "Euphronia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are often followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Euphronia is native to Central and South America and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
