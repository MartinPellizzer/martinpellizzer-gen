    "intro": "Elymus vaginatus, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically blue to purple in color, contributing to its ornamental value. Elymus vaginatus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and along roadsides. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
