    "intro": "Eulophia laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian eulophia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in variable environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure."
