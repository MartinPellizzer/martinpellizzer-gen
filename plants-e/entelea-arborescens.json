    "intro": "Entelea arborescens, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that helps it withstand saltwater and tidal forces. The plant has aerial roots that grow from its branches, allowing it to anchor itself in shallow water and facilitate gas exchange. Its small, dark red flowers are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Entelea arborescens plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
