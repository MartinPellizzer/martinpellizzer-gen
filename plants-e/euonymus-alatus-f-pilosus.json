    "intro": "Euonymus alatus f. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy winged euonymus, is a variant of the winged euonymus, characterized by its distinctive, wing-like structures on its stems. This plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, inflated seed capsules that persist into the winter. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
