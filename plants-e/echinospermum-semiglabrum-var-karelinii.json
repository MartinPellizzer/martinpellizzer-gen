    "intro": "Echinospermum semiglabrum var. karelinii, commonly known as the Karakul lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are linear and grass-like, with a fibrous root system adapted to dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in summer. Its scientific name reflects its spiny, hairy seeds, a characteristic feature of the genus Echinospermum. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
