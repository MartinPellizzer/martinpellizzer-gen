    "intro": "Euphorbia nelii, commonly known as the Mediterranean spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features succulent, ribbed stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires care. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Euphorbia nelii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
