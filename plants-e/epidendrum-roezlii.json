    "intro": "Epidendrum roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6sel's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.

The plant typically has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
