    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cartilagineum, commonly known as the cartilaginous harts-tongue fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, and the fronds are usually clustered at the base. Elaphoglossum cartilagineum is notable for its unique, cartilaginous texture and its role in understory vegetation in its native habitats."
