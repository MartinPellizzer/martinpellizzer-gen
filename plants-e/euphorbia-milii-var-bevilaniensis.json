    "intro": "Euphorbia milii var. bevilaniensis, commonly known as the flame tree or bevilaniensis euphorbia, is a striking ornamental plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The plant features thick, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its unique cyathia, which are specialized flower clusters. This variety is relatively low maintenance, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
