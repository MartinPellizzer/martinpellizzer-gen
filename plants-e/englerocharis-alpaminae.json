    "intro": "Englerocharis alpaminae, commonly known as the Andean star moss, is a rare and unique species of liverwort found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-like thallus structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on rocky substrates at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its small, delicate leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
