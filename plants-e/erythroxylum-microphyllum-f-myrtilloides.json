    "intro": "Erythroxylum microphyllum f. myrtilloides, commonly known as the purpleleaf mallow, is a variant of the erythroxylum genus native to South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that often display a striking purple or reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its botanical features include a woody stem with a rough, hairy texture and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf coloration and delicate floral display."
