    "intro": "Eriocaulon kummerianum, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to submerged conditions. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Eriocaulon kummerianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and support biodiversity."
