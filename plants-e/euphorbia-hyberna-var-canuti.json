    "intro": "Euphorbia hyberna var. canuti, commonly known as the Irish spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
