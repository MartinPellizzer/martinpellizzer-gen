It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening at night and closing by dawn. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
