    "intro": "Eutrema deltoideum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
