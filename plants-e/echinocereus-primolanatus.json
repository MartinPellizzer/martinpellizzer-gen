    "intro": "Echinocereus primolanatus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in spines and have a distinctive red or pink coloration. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and bats. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established. Its structure and growth habits make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections."
