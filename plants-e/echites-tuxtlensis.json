    "intro": "Echites tuxtlensis, commonly known as the Tuxtlans ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the humid lowland forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, pale purple flowers that bloom at night. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is rarely seen in the wild. Its botanical study is of great interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance."
