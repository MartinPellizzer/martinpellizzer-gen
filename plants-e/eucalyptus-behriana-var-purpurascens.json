    "intro": "Eucalyptus behriana var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leafed ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that displays a range of colors, including grey, white, and pink. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish or purplish hue, which gives the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
