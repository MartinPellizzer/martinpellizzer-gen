    "intro": "Euterpe petiolata, commonly known as the pink palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its slender, clustered stems and elongated, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant pinkish-red color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, edible fruits resembling small, sweet cherries. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
