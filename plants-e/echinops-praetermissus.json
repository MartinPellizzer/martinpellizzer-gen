    "intro": "Echinops praetermissus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, giving it its genus name \"Echinops,\" which means \"spiny head.\" The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive seed pods. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Echinops praetermissus is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
