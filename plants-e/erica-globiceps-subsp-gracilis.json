    "intro": "Erica globiceps subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and vibrant floral display."
