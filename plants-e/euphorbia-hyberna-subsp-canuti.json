    "intro": "Euphorbia hyberna subsp. canuti, commonly known as the Irish spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western Europe. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
