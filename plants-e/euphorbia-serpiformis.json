    "intro": "Euphorbia serpiformis, commonly known as the snake plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that resemble a snake, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it store water. Euphorbia serpiformis is well adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant."
