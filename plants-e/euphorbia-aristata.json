    "intro": "Euphorbia aristata, commonly known as the \"arrowleaf euphorbia,\" is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
