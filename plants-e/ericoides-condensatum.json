    "intro": "Ericoides condensatum, commonly known as the dense heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in spring. Ericoides condensatum is well adapted to sandy soils and salty sea air, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife."
