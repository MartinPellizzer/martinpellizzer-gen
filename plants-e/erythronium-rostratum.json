    "intro": "Erythronium rostratum, commonly known as the rostrate dog's mercury, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive reddish-brown midrib. The plant produces a single, showy, nodding flower with a golden-yellow corolla and a prominent red-brown throat. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully expanded. Erythronium rostratum is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
