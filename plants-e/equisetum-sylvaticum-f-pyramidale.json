    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum f. pyramidale, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horse tail, is a fern-like plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are jointed and covered in small, scale-like structures, which are remnants of its primitive evolutionary form. This fern-like plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and historical significance in botanical studies."
