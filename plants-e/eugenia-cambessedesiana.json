    "intro": "Eugenia cambessedesiana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a peppery taste. It is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
