    "intro": "Eupatorium brittonianum, commonly known as Britton's boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium brittonianum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
