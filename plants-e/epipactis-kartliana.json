    "intro": "Epipactis kartliana, commonly known as the Kartli orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Caucasus region. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, upright stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow lip and a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
