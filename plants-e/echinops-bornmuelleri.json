    "intro": "Echinops bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Desert Thistle, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a sea urchin, which give it its scientific name. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops bornmuelleri is well adapted to harsh, semi-desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
