    "intro": "Elymus edelbergii, commonly known as the Edelberg's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often blue-green colored leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Elymus edelbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
