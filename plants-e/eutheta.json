    "intro": "Eutheta, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified stems called cyathia. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. Eutheta species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous true flowers within the cyathia. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking, unusual appearance."
