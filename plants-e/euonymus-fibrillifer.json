    "intro": "Euonymus fibrillifer, commonly known as the fibrous woodbine, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Euonymus fibrillifer thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticulture."
