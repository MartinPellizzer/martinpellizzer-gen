It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its botanical structure is typical of many orchids, with a complex root system and specialized flowers adapted for pollination by insects."
