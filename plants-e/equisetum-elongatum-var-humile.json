    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. humile, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. This variety is smaller than the typical Equisetum elongatum, with a more compact growth form."
