    "intro": "Eusteralis crassicaulis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf broadleaf gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features basal leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
