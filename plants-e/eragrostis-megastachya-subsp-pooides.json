    "intro": "Eragrostis megastachya subsp. pooides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and panicle-shaped inflorescence that produces small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form dense, low-growing clumps. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
