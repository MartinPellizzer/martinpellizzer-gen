    "intro": "Eichhornia tricolor, commonly known as the tri-color water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features showy, three-colored flowers that range from white to pink and purple, and its leaves are broad and floating. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate makes it both an ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions. Eichhornia tricolor plays a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and heavy metals from the water."
