    "intro": "Echeveria obtusifolia var. scopulorum, commonly known as the Rock Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
