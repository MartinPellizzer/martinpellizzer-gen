    "intro": "Ecastaphyllum glaucum, commonly known as the blue-green lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like growth on rock surfaces. It is characterized by its pale blue-green thallus, which is rich in photosynthetic pigments. The lichen thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on limestone or sandstone. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a cyanobacterium and a fungus. This species is relatively uncommon and is of interest to lichenologists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
