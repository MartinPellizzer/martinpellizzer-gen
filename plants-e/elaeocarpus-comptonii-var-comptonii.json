It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
