    "intro": "Eleocharis simplex, commonly known as spike grass, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often densely packed with small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis simplex plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
