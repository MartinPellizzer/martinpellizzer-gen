    "intro": "Epidendrum psilosepalum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a fine, velvety coating. Epidendrum psilosepalum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its specific care requirements."
