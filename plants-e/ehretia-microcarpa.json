    "intro": "Ehretia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited ehretia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by smooth, spherical fruits that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
