It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils near the shoreline. Ekebergia fruticosa is valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in traditional medicine and construction."
