    "intro": "Erigeron breweri var. klamathensis, commonly known as Klamath blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Klamath Mountains in California and Oregon. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native range. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
