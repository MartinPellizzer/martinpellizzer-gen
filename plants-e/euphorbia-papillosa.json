    "intro": "Euphorbia papillosa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Euphorbia papillosa is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering once established."
