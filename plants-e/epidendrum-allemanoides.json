    "intro": "Epidendrum allemanoides, commonly known as the Orchid of the Andes, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Epidendrum allemanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
