    "intro": "Eriopus acaulis, commonly known as the barrenstem eriopus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its lack of a true stem, with leaves forming a dense rosette near the ground. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
