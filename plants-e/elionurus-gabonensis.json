    "intro": "Elionurus gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon star grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as savannas and forest edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
