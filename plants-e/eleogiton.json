    "intro": "Eleogiton, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Eleogiton is considered an endangered species."
