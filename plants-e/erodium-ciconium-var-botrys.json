    "intro": "Erodium ciconium var. botrys, commonly known as the clustered bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it is sometimes considered a weed."
