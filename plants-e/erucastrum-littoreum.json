    "intro": "Erucastrum littoreum, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Erucastrum littoreum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
