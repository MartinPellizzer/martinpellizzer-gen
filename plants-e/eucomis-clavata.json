It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence adorned with small, white or pale purple flowers. Its unique appearance, resembling a pineapple, gives it its common name. Eucomis clavata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
