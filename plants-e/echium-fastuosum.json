It is characterized by its striking purple or pink flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators such as moths and bats. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oily seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Echium fastuosum is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting nocturnal pollinators."
