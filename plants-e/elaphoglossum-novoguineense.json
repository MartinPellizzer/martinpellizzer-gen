    "intro": "Elaphoglossum novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of New Guinea and Indonesia. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or cascading in growth habit. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are often covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum novoguineense is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth."
