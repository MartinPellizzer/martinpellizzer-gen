    "intro": "Elaeocarpus kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi elaeocarpus, is a deciduous tree native to southern China. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that are encased in a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
