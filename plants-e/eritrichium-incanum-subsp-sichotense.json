    "intro": "Eritrichium incanum subsp. sichotense, commonly known as the Tibetan hoary vetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, particularly Tibet and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It has a low-growing habit with branched stems and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
