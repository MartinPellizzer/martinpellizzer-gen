    "intro": "Eysenhardtia schizocalyx, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert and semi-desert regions. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native range."
