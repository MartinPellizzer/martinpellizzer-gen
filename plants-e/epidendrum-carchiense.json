    "intro": "Epidendrum carchiense, commonly known as the Carchiense Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the highlands of Ecuador. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and produces multiple fleshy, elliptical pseudobulbs. The plant typically bears racemose inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Epidendrum carchiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
