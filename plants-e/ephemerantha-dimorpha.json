    "intro": "Ephemerantha dimorpha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. Its unique growth habit and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas."
