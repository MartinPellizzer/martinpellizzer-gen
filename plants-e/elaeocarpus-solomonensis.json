    "intro": "Elaeocarpus solomonensis, commonly known as the Solomon Islands ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are typically red or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountainous rainforests. Due to its slow growth and high wood value, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
