    "intro": "Eriocaulon nantoense var. micropetalum, commonly known as the small-petalled marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its fine, delicate foliage. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are adapted for dispersal in aquatic environments. The variety micropetalum is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate petals compared to other varieties of Eriocaulon."
