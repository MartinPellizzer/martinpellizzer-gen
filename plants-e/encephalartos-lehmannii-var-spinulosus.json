    "intro": "Encephalartos lehmannii var. spinulosus, commonly known as the spinulose cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in small, spiny projections. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and yellowish, while the female cones are more compact and green. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
