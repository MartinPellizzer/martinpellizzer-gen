    "intro": "Euphorbia copiapina, commonly known as the Copiap\u00f3 spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapted to extreme drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, fleshy stems and leaves help it store water, enabling survival in harsh climates. Euphorbia copiapina is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
