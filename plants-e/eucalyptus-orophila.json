    "intro": "Eucalyptus orophila, commonly known as the alpine eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pink flowers, which are visited by various pollinators. Its growth is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, with a slow growth rate and a tendency to form dense, compact foliage. Eucalyptus orophila is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native range."
