    "intro": "Eriosema cajanoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
