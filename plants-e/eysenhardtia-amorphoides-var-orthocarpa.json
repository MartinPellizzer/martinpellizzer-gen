    "intro": "Eysenhardtia amorphoides var. orthocarpa, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California. It has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range."
