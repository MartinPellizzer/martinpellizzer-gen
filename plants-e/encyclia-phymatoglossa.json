    "intro": "Encyclia phymatoglossa, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette, which helps in reducing water loss. Encyclia phymatoglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
