    "intro": "Ehrenbergia ciliata, commonly known as the desert star or desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Ehrenbergia ciliata is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
