    "intro": "Elaphoglossum piloselloides, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of short, hairy scales, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are usually covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum piloselloides is a relatively rare species, often found in specific geographic regions with particular microclimatic conditions."
