    "intro": "Eupatorium squamosum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom from late summer into early autumn. Its foliage is characterized by grayish-white undersides and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Eupatorium squamosum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
