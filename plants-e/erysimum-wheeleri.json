    "intro": "Erysimum wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
