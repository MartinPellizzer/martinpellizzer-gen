    "intro": "Epidendrum ibaguense, commonly known as the Ibaguense orchid, is a species native to Colombia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
