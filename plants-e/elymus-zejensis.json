    "intro": "Elymus zejensis, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fine, needle-like leaves, which are adapted to cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Elymus zejensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme climatic conditions."
