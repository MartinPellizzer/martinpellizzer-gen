    "intro": "Eucalyptus cajuputea, commonly known as lemon myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their potent essential oils. Eucalyptus cajuputea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range."
