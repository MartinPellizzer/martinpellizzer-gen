It features small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, upright stems and linear, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.
