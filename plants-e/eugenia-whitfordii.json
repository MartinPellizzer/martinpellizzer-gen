    "intro": "Eugenia whitfordii, commonly known as the Whitsunday satinash, is a species of flowering plant native to the Whitsunday Islands in Queensland, Australia. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round, red berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Eugenia whitfordii is adapted to coastal and tropical environments, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for native fauna."
