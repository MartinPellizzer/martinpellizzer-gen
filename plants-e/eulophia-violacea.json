    "intro": "Eulophia violacea, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which are often fragrant. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. Eulophia violacea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
