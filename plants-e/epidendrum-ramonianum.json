    "intro": "Epidendrum ramonianum, commonly known as the Ramon's Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforest environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in loose, terminal inflorescences. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum ramonianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
