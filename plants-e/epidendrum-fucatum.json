    "intro": "Epidendrum fucatum, commonly known as the black orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, often almost black, foliage and its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in the soil. Its flowers are borne on branched inflorescences and are often pollinated by flies and bees. Epidendrum fucatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
