    "intro": "Echinocereus enneacanthus subsp. carnosus, commonly known as the fat-horned cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and dense clusters of spines, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and hardiness."
