    "intro": "Echinops manshuricus, commonly known as the Manchurian thistle, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a spiky globe, which are a defining feature of the genus Echinops. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echinops manshuricus produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by the distinctive seed heads that persist through the winter."
