It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is part of the legume family and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
