    "intro": "Erica rusticula, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. Erica rusticula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive ground covers in suitable climates."
