    "intro": "Encephalartos horridus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf Natal fern, is a compact, evergreen cycadoid plant native to South Africa. It features a short, stout trunk with a dense crown of dark green, leathery leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard species. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires partial shade to full sun. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and collections of rare cycads."
