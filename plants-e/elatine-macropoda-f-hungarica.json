    "intro": "Elatine macropoda f. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian waterwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged or floating. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters. This fern-like plant is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to water quality changes."
