    "intro": "Eremocarpus setiger, commonly known as the sand mat or sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, a characteristic typical of many arid-adapted species. Eremocarpus setiger is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments."
