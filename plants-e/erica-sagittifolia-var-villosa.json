    "intro": "Erica sagittifolia var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that is covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
