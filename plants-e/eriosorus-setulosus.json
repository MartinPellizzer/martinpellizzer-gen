    "intro": "Eriosorus setulosus, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Eriosorus setulosus is often found in temperate regions and is a common species in forested areas."
