    "intro": "Euphorbia rubescens, commonly known as the red spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
