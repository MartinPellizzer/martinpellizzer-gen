    "intro": "Euphorbia palustris, commonly known as swamp spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a succulent, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter tall, often with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia palustris thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
