    "intro": "Epidendrum aquilalatum, commonly known as the Cloudy Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
