    "intro": "Epidendrum hircinum, commonly known as the goat orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with flowers that are typically pink or red, often with a contrasting lip. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum hircinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
