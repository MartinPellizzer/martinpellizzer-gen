    "intro": "Equisetum robustum var. minus, commonly known as the slender scouring rush, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a distinct, unbranched stem that is covered with small, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are borne at the top of the plant. This variety is notable for its reduced size compared to the typical Equisetum robustum, making it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its habitat."
