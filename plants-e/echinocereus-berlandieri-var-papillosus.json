    "intro": "Echinocereus berlandieri var. papillosus, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that often branch at the base, forming dense, shrub-like clusters. The plant produces striking red or yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it well adapted to desert conditions."
