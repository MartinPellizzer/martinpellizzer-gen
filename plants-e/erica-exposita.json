    "intro": "Erica exposita, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. The plant features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the summer months. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Erica exposita plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
