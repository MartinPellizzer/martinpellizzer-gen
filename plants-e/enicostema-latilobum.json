    "intro": "Enicostema latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with distinctive broad lobes at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
