    "intro": "Epilobium boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Epilobium boissieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
