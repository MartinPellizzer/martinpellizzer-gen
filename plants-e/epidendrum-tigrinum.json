    "intro": "Epidendrum tigrinum, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that display vibrant orange and yellow flowers with contrasting dark markings. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, well-lit environments. Epidendrum tigrinum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
