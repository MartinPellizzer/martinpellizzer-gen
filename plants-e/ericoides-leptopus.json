    "intro": "Ericoides leptopus, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by insects, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife. Ericoides leptopus is an important component of the coastal flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystem."
