It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, pink or white flowers and delicate, opposite leaves. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. It produces small, round fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Erodium carolinianum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
