    "intro": "Episcia congesta, commonly known as the clustered waxy begonia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright, waxy leaves that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as a trailing or compact shrub, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a decorative foliage plant. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, which helps it survive in drier conditions. Episcia congesta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular watering to maintain its lush appearance."
