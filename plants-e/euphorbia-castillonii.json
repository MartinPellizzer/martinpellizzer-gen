    "intro": "Euphorbia castillonii, commonly known as the Castillon's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, branched stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia castillonii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and unique aesthetic."
