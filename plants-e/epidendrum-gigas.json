    "intro": "Epidendrum gigas, commonly known as the giant epidendrum, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. Epidendrum gigas thrives in warm, moist conditions with high humidity and indirect light."
