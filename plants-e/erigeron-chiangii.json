    "intro": "Erigeron chiangii, commonly known as the Chiang Mai fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest clearings. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
