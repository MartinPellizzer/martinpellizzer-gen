    "intro": "Eugenia cristata, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns or hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible when ripe but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used for coastal stabilization due to its salt tolerance. Eugenia cristata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in various island communities."
