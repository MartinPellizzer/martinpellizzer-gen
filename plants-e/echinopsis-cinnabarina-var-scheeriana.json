    "intro": "Echinopsis cinnabarina var. scheeriana, commonly known as the Red Echinopsis, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its striking red to orange spines and a globular, ribbed stem. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom in the evening. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
