    "intro": "Eschweilera rodriguesiana, commonly known as the Rodrigues wax palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the island of Rodrigues, part of the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits containing a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
