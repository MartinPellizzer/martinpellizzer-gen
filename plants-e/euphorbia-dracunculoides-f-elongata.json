    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to gardens. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
