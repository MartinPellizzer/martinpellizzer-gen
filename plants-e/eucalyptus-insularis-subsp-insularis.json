    "intro": "Eucalyptus insularis subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Lord Howe Island eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree endemic to Lord Howe Island. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are usually pale or cream-colored, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators. The plant is adapted to the unique island environment, with features that help it survive in the humid, tropical climate. It plays an important ecological role in the local ecosystem, supporting a range of native fauna."
