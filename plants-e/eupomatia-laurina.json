    "intro": "Eupomatia laurina, commonly known as the laurina eupomatia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in coastal and lowland forests. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly the New Zealand silvereye, and it produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Eupomatia laurina is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
