    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. munzii, commonly known as the Munz's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
