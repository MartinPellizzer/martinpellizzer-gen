    "intro": "Eichhornia cordifolia, commonly known as water hyacinth, is an aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces showy purple flowers that bloom sequentially along the stems. Water hyacinth can grow rapidly, often forming dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water bodies. Its roots are fibrous and can extend several centimeters below the water surface, aiding in nutrient absorption."
