    "intro": "Eragrostis tenella var. plumosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades that are often covered with silky, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It forms dense, low-growing sod and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil. However, it is not commonly used in turfgrass due to its limited cold hardiness and slow growth rate."
