    "intro": "Epidendrum breviyacuriense, commonly known as the short-stemmed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively short, sturdy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This epiphytic orchid is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
