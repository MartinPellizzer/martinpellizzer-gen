    "intro": "Eugenia crispula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Eugenia crispula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for its purported healing properties."
