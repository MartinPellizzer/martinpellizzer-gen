    "intro": "Euphorbia hyssopifolia var. pruinosa, commonly known as the Prune-flowered Spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in a distinctive waxy, powdery coating that gives it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by brightly colored bracts, typically red or orange. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often with a rough texture. This species is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
