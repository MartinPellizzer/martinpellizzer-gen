    "intro": "Elymus giganteus, commonly known as giant wheatgrass, is a tall perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green foliage and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Its rapid growth and hardiness make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
