It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a low shrub or small tree, often forming dense thickets in heathland and woodland habitats. It is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with a Mediterranean climate. The species plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various native fauna."
