    "intro": "Eleocharis verrucosa, commonly known as the\u75a3\u679c\u838e\u8349, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in tiny, fleshy, spiky structures called achenes, which are adapted for dispersal by water or animals. Eleocharis verrucosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
