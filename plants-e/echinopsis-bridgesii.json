    "intro": "Echinopsis bridgesii, commonly known as the Bridges' moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and a crown of large, white to pale blue flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the surface soil. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Echinopsis bridgesii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
