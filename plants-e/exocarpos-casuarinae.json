    "intro": "Exocarpos casuarinae, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, red, fleshy fruits that resemble berries, which are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often mistaken for the leaves of the casuarina genus, leading to some taxonomic confusion. It thrives in coastal and wetland environments, preferring well-drained sandy soils. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and providing food resources."
