    "intro": "Euphorbia subtrifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of fleshy, triangular leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
