    "intro": "Eschscholzia yainacensis var. modocensis, commonly known as Modoc poppy, is a rare and endemic species native to the Modoc Plateau in California. It is a herbaceous annual plant with striking bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces slender, hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
