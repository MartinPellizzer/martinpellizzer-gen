    "intro": "Eugenia pteroclada, commonly known as the winged guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit, a small, round drupe, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Eugenia pteroclada is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
