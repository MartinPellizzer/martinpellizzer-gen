    "intro": "Erythroxylum gracilipes var. exareolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved copal tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. This variant is notable for its potential use in traditional medicine and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
