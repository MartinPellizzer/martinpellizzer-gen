    "intro": "Endymion hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish endymion, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
