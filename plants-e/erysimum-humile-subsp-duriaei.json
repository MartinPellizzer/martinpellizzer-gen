    "intro": "Erysimum humile subsp. duriaei, commonly known as the dwarf wallflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base, helping it to retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing on rocky slopes and coastal areas. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
