    "intro": "Erodium gasparrinii, commonly known as Gasparrini's bird's-beak, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
