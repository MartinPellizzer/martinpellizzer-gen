It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a compact rosette. Eucephalus frigidus plays an important role in Arctic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
