    "intro": "Echinodorus berteroi var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterweed, is a flowering aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often bright green and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water surface. It thrives in slow to moderately flowing freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to oxygenate water. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, which can help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life."
