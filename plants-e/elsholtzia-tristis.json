    "intro": "Elsholtzia tristis, commonly known as the gray germander, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has slender, hairy stems that are often branched. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue to purple in color, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of whitish to grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Elsholtzia tristis is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky soils or along dry streambeds."
