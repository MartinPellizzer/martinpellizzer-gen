    "intro": "Eriogonum cernuum subsp. viscosum, commonly known as sticky leaf buckwheat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, sticky leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often glandular and emit a mild, aromatic scent. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as meadows and sagebrush steppe."
