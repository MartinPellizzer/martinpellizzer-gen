    "intro": "Elymus dorudicus, commonly known as the Dorudic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Elymus dorudicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
