It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Epidendrum grahamii is known for its ability to bloom multiple times a year under optimal conditions."
