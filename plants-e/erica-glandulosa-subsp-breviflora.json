    "intro": "Erica glandulosa subsp. breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered heath, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and covered in fine glands, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
