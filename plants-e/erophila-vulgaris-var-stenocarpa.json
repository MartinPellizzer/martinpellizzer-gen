    "intro": "Erophila vulgaris var. stenocarpa, commonly known as narrow-fruit watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its small, oval-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces tiny white flowers that bloom from June to August. The fruit is a narrow, elongated capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by water."
