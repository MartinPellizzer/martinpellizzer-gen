    "intro": "Enterosora spongiosa, commonly known as the spongey bladdergrass, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its fibrous, spongy roots that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Enterosora spongiosa is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid habitats."
