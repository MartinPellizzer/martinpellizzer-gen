    "intro": "Epidendrum papilio, commonly known as the Orchid Butterfly, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-like flowers that are typically bright yellow with red or orange markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
