    "intro": "Euphorbia matritensis, commonly known as the Madrid spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
