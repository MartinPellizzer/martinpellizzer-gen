It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are a distinctive feature of the genus Echinops. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Echinops prionolepis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, architectural form and drought tolerance."
