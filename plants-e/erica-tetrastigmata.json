    "intro": "Erica tetrastigmata, commonly known as the four-stigma heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the southern regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and its clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Erica tetrastigmata produces four stamens, which is reflected in its scientific name, and is often found growing in well-drained, acidic soils. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
