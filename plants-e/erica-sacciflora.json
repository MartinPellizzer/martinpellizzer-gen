    "intro": "Erica sacciflora, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves covered in a fine, woolly layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica sacciflora produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments."
