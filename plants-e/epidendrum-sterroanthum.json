    "intro": "Epidendrum sterroanthum, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences that bear striking, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive ghost-like appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
