    "intro": "Eschweilera serrulata, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape with serrated edges. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, fleshy fruits. Due to its ornamental value and timber use, it is also cultivated in some regions for horticultural purposes."
