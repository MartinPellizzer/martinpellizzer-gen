    "intro": "Erica pubescens var. minor, commonly known as the lesser heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features compact, needle-like leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal areas."
