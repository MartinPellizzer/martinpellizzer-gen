    "intro": "Erythrina inermis, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm season. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in soft, velvety hairs. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Erythrina inermis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant floral display."
