    "intro": "Euphoria exstipulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent stems and leaves allow it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Euphoria exstipulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
