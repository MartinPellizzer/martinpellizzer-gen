    "intro": "Eucalyptus ornata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or tree form, with smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue, and they are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The flowers are small and white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat."
