    "intro": "Epidendrum superbum, commonly known as the noble orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching stems that can grow up to several meters in length, supporting numerous showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces vibrant, often fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic growth. Epidendrum superbum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
