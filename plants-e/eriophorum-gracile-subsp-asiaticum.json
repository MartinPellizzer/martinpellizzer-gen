    "intro": "Eriophorum gracile subsp. asiaticum, commonly known as the Asian cotton grass, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton balls, which are composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
