    "intro": "Eriocaulon pseudopygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as marshes and ponds. Its flowering structures consist of tiny white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense spikes. Eriocaulon pseudopygmaeum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
