    "intro": "Epidendrum pendens, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Epidendrum pendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
