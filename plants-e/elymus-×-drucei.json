    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 drucei, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a hybrid between Elymus repens (poverty grass) and Elymus lanceolatus (threadleaf wheatgrass), resulting in a plant with unique genetic traits. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces spikelets that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Elymus \u00d7 drucei is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and for its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
