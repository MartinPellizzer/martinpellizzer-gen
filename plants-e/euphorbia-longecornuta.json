    "intro": "Euphorbia longecornuta, commonly known as the long-horned spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is known for its ability to store water in its tissues, making it drought-tolerant. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
