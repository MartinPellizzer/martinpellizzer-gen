    "intro": "Elymus foliosus, commonly known as bluegrass or wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blade-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and along stream banks. Elymus foliosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
