    "intro": "Epipactis monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its single, broad, lance-shaped leaf that is often hairy on the underside. The plant produces a tall, erect stem bearing a single spike of greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive, spurred lips. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Epipactis monophylla is noted for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found in association with other orchid species."
