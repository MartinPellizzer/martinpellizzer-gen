    "intro": "Elytrigia strigosa, commonly known as rough-stemmed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually clustered in panicles. It produces small, two-lobed flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Elytrigia strigosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
