    "intro": "Eugenia, commonly known as the clove tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It comprises over 1,000 species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The most well-known species, *Eugenia aromatica*, is cultivated for its fragrant flower buds, which are used as a spice. These plants typically have aromatic leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits. They thrive in warm, humid climates and are often grown for their ornamental value as well as their economic importance in the spice trade."
