    "intro": "Eriochloa ramosa var. involucrata, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense tufts, with leaves that are narrow and slightly hairy. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with bracts that are often involucral, giving it its botanical name.
