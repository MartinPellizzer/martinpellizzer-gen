    "intro": "Elymus lenensis, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned lemmas, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Elymus lenensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its resilience to harsh environmental conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
