    "intro": "Evelyna haematoxantha, commonly known as the bloodflower, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals that resemble drops of blood, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and produces small, yellow disc flowers at the center of its blooms. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect sunlight in its harsh environment. Evelyna haematoxantha is known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous communities for its anti-inflammatory and healing qualities."
