It has thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by pale green to yellowish fruits. It is well adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important species in its native habitat."
