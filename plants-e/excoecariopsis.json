    "intro": "Excoecariopsis, commonly known as the \"tropical fruit tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen shrubs or small trees, often with smooth, dark bark and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible and contain a single seed, making them valuable in tropical agriculture. Excoecariopsis species are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, and they play a role in both ecological and economic systems."
