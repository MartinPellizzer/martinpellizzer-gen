    "intro": "Elaphoglossum murinum, commonly known as the mouse-tailed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the tail of a mouse, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Elaphoglossum murinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
