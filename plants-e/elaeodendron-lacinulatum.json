    "intro": "Elaeodendron lacinulatum, commonly known as the laceleaf elaeodendron, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in panicles, and are usually white or pale yellow in color. Elaeodendron lacinulatum is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
