    "intro": "Ebermaiera coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved evergreen, is a tropical plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface, providing it with a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
