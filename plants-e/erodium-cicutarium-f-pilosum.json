    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a similar hairy texture. This variant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats."
