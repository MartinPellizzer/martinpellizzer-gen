It is a perennial plant that typically grows as a small shrub, featuring spiny stems and fleshy, segmented leaves. The plant is notable for its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant's unique blooming pattern and adaptability to harsh conditions make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
