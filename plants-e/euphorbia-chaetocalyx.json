    "intro": "Euphorbia chaetocalyx, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. Euphorbia chaetocalyx is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
