    "intro": "Euphorbia sulcata var. maroccana, commonly known as the African milk tree or desert rose, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow quite tall, often reaching several feet in height. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Its leaves are usually narrow and spiny, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is prized for its resilience and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening."
