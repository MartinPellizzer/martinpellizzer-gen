It is characterized by its compact, spherical inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
