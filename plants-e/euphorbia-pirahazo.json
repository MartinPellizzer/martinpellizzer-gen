    "intro": "Euphorbia pirahazo, commonly known as the Pirahazo spurge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
