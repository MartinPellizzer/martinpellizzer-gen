It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
