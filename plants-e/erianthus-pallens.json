    "intro": "Erianthus pallens, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Erianthus pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
