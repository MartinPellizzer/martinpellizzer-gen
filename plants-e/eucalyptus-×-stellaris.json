    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 stellaris, commonly known as the star eucalyptus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus tereticornis. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped buds, which are a defining feature of the species. The plant typically grows as a medium-sized tree with smooth, often grey or white bark that peels in strips. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silver-green hue with a rough texture. The flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are borne in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds."
