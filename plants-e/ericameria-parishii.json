    "intro": "Ericameria parishii, commonly known as the Parish's ericoid, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ericameria parishii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
