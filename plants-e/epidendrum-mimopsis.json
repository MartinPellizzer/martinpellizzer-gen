    "intro": "Epidendrum mimopsis, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a spike with a pleasant, sweet fragrance. Epidendrum mimopsis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
