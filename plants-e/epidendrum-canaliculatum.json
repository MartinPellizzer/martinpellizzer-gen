    "intro": "Epidendrum canaliculatum, commonly known as the channelled epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy stems and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces numerous small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum canaliculatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
