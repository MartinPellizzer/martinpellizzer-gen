    "intro": "Epilobium affine var. fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and wet meadows. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
