    "intro": "Epidendrum claviculatum, commonly known as the Clavicle Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a pseudobulb with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish with a distinctive red or purple lip, and they bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Epidendrum claviculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment."
