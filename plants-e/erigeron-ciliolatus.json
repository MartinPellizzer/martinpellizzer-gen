It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The showy white to pale yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
