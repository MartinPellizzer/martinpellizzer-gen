    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. taurica, commonly known as the taurica spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, berry-like structures called cyathia, which contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red perianth. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
