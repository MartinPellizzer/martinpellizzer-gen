    "intro": "Elaphoglossum manantlanense, commonly known as the Manantlan holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a light green coloration. Native to the humid forests of Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. Elaphoglossum manantlanense is often found in montane cloud forests, where it plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
