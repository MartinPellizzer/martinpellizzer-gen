    "intro": "Erica petraea, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, maritime climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica petraea plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
