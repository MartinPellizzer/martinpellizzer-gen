It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy underside. Its most distinctive feature is its yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
