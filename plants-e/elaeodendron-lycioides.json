It features simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its bark and leaves contain milky sap, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Elaeodendron lycioides is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
