    "intro": "Elymus parodii, commonly known as the Parodi's grass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Elymus parodii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
