    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy, and smooth-stemmed structure, which helps it retain water in arid conditions. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
