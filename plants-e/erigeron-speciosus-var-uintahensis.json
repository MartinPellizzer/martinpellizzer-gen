    "intro": "Erigeron speciosus var. uintahensis, commonly known as Uinta's blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its blue to purple ray florets and gray-green foliage, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes, preferring full sun exposure. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, producing showy composite flowers that attract pollinators. The variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Erigeron speciosus."
