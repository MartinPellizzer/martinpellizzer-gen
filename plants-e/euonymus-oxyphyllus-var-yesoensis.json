It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to reveal seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
