    "intro": "Eriogonum shockleyi subsp. candidum, commonly known as the white-flowered buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its subspecific name, *candidum*, refers to the pale, almost white coloration of its flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
