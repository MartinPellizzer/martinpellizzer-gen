    "intro": "Espeletia neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leaved espeletia, is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Espeletia neriifolia is often found in rocky or open habitats, showcasing its adaptability to high-altitude conditions."
