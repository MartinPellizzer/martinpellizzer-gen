    "intro": "Elaphoglossum, commonly known as the fernlet, is a genus of small, delicate ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their compact stature and finely divided, often pinnate leaves that give them a lacy appearance. Elaphoglossum species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They are widely distributed across the Americas, with many species found in tropical and subtropical regions. The genus is noted for its diverse morphology and ecological adaptability, making it an important component of many understory plant communities."
