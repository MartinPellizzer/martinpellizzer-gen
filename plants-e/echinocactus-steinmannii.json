    "intro": "Echinocactus steinmannii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense, spiny areoles that bear yellow or white glochids. The plant features a ribbed stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with a thick, water-storing trunk. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles during the spring and summer months. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
