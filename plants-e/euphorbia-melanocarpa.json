    "intro": "Euphorbia melanocarpa, commonly known as the black euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
