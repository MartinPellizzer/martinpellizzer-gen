    "intro": "Exallage radicans, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense colonies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and usually pink or purple in color. Exallage radicans plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
