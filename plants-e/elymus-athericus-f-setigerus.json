    "intro": "Elymus athericus f. setigerus, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
