    "intro": "Elymus sibiricus var. glaucus, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its glaucous, bluish-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
