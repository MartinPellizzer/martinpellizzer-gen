    "intro": "Eritrichium canum var. fruticulosum, commonly known as the hairy eritrichium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
