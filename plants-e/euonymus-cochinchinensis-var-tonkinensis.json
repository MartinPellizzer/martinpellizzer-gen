    "intro": "Euonymus cochinchinensis var. tonkinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese spurge or Tonkin euonymus, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
