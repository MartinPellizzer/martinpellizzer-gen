    "intro": "Eleocharis capitata var. borealis, commonly known as the northern spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to cold climates in the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in bogs, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its slender, cylindrical stems are usually unbranched, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is adapted to harsh, temperate environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
