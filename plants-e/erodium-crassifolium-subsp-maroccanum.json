    "intro": "Erodium crassifolium subsp. maroccanum, commonly known as the Moroccan bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in rocky and sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as steppes and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in semi-arid environments."
