    "intro": "Erica australis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered heath, is a variant of the common heath plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or heathland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
