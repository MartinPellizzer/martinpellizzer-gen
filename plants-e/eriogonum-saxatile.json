    "intro": "Eriogonum saxatile, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum saxatile is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
