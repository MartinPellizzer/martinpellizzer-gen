    "intro": "Erica tetralix var. mackayana, commonly known as the Mackay's heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense thickets in suitable conditions."
