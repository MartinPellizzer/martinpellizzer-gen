It features narrow, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a fragrant, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense growth habit and aromatic foliage make it both visually appealing and ecologically beneficial."
