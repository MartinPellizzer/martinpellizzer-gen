It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens."
