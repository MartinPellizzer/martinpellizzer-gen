    "intro": "Euphorbia verrucosa f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
