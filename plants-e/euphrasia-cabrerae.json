    "intro": "Euphrasia cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euphrasia cabrerae is considered a rare and endangered species."
