    "intro": "Euchile karwinskii, commonly known as the Karwinski's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euchile karwinskii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
