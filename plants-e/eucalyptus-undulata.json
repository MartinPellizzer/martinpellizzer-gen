    "intro": "Eucalyptus undulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically grey-green in color and have a rough, felt-like texture. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which appear in winter and spring. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments and is often found in heathlands and woodland areas."
