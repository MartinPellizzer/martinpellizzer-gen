    "intro": "Euphorbia sieboldiana var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Spurge, is a succulent shrub native to parts of East Asia. It features dense, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, clustered yellowish flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. However, its milky sap can be irritating to the skin, so handling requires caution."
