    "intro": "Eremophila linsmithii, commonly known as the Linsmith's bushfire wattle, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and red, which bloom during the autumn season. It has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Eremophila linsmithii is well-suited to drought-tolerant gardens and is often used in xeriscaping."
