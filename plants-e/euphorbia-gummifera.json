    "intro": "Euphorbia gummifera, commonly known as the gum arabic euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which is the source of gum arabic, a substance used in food and pharmaceutical industries. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
