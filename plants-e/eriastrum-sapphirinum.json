    "intro": "Eriastrum sapphirinum, commonly known as the blue eriastrum, is a flowering plant native to California. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriastrum sapphirinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
