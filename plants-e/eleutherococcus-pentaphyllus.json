    "intro": "Eleutherococcus pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-leaf eleuthero, is a deciduous shrub native to the Far East, particularly China and Korea. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its roots and stems are used in traditional medicine for their purported adaptogenic properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
