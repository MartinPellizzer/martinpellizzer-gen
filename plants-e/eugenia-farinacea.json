    "intro": "Eugenia farinacea, commonly known as the wax apple or Surinam cherry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating, giving it its common name. The fruit is edible, with a tart flavor, and is often used in jams, jellies, and beverages. Eugenia farinacea thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit yield."
