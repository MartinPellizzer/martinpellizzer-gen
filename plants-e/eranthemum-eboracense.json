    "intro": "Eranthemum eboracense, commonly known as the York waterplantain, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern England and parts of Scandinavia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
