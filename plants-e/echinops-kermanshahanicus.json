    "intro": "Echinops kermanshahanicus, commonly known as the Kermanshah thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western Iran. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a crown of thorns. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, hot climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echinops kermanshahanicus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
