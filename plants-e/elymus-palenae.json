    "intro": "Elymus palenae, commonly known as the pale wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Elymus palenae thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
