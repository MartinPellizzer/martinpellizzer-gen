It is native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil, particularly in the states of Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silky hair that gives it its common name.
