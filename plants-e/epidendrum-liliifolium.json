    "intro": "Epidendrum liliifolium, commonly known as the Lily-leaf Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, lily-like appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum liliifolium is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
