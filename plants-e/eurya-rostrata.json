It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. Eurya rostrata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in shaded garden settings. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
