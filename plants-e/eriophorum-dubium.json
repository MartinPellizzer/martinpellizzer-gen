    "intro": "Eriophorum dubium, commonly known as the slender cotton-grass, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescence that resembles cotton, which is composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often forms dense mats or tussocks. Eriophorum dubium is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
