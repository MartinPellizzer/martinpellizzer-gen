    "intro": "Eriastrum diffusum subsp. utahense, commonly known as Utah sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It typically features hairy, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
