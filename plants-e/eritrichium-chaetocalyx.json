It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
