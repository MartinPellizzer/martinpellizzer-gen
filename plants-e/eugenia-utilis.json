    "intro": "Eugenia utilis, commonly known as the wax apple or Java apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits with a tough, waxy skin. The fruit contains a single seed and is often used in culinary applications due to its sweet, tart flavor. Eugenia utilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
