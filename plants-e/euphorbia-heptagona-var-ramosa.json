    "intro": "Euphorbia heptagona var. ramosa, commonly known as the branched spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, a swollen stem base, which serves as a water storage organ, typical of many succulents. The plant has a branching habit, with multiple stems arising from the base, giving it a bushy appearance. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and arranged in a whorl, while the flowers are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
