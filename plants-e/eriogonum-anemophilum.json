    "intro": "Eriogonum anemophilum, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, a feature reflected in its common name. Eriogonum anemophilum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in desert ecosystems."
