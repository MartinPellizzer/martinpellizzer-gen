    "intro": "Epipactis tallosii subsp. zaupolensis, commonly known as the Zaupolensian helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and relatively small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. This subspecies thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often growing on the forest floor. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a long flowering period that extends into early summer. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
