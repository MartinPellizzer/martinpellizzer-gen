    "intro": "Eucalyptus bella, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a silvery underside. It produces small, fluffy white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the winter months. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
