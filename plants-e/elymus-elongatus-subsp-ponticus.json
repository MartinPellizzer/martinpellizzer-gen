It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
