    "intro": "Encelia foetida, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and Baja California. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and coastal dunes. The plant features small, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Encelia foetida is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more noticeable when the plant is damaged or in bloom."
