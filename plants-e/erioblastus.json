It includes species native to the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and parts of Central and South America. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their aromatic, waxy leaves and showy white or pink flowers. They produce small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. Erioblastus species are also valued for their ornamental qualities and have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
