    "intro": "Epilobium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spikes, and bloom in early spring. Epilobium pusillum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators."
