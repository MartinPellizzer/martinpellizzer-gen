    "intro": "Euodia rubra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its use in furniture and musical instruments. Euodia rubra typically grows in tropical rainforests and is often found in lowland to hill forest areas. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
