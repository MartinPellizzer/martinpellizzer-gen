    "intro": "Euphorbia umbellulata var. major, commonly known as the giant candlestick euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered in dense, woolly white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a distinctive, candle-like appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
