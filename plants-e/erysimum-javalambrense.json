    "intro": "Erysimum javalambrense, commonly known as the Javalambre wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and roadsides. Its yellow or orange flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
