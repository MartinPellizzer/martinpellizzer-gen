It typically grows in sandy soils and is found in the Geraldton area. The plant has smooth, grey to white bark that peels in strips, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal creamy-white flowers, followed by capsule fruits containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance and is often used in local horticulture and conservation efforts."
