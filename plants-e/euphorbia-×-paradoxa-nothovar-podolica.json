    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 paradoxa nothovar. podolica, commonly known as the Podolica spurge, is a hybrid plant characterized by its distinctive, often branched stems and modified leaves. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are its most striking feature. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
