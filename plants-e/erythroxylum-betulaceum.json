    "intro": "Erythroxylum betulaceum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
