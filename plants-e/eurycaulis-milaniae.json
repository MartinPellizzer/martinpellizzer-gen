    "intro": "Eurycaulis milaniae, commonly known as the Milanian's Eurycaulis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its growth is slow, and it is often found in rocky crevices or on mountain slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
