    "intro": "Eriogonum nutans, commonly known as the nodding buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Eriogonum nutans plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
