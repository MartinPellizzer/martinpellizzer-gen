    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. ararica, commonly known as Canadian spotted spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green stems and leaves that are often dotted with small, white to yellowish glands. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
