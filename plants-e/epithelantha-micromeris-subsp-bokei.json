    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris subsp. bokei, commonly known as the Mexican firecrown cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the state of Sinaloa in Mexico. It features a compact, globular stem with a greenish-gray color and produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. However, it is important to note that it is protected in its native habitat, making it a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
