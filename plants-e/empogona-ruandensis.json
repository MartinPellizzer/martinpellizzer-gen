    "intro": "Empogona ruandensis, commonly known as the Ruanda fig, is a tropical shrub native to Central Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife and humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
