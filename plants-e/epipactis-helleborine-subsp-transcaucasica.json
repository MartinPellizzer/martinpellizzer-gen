    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. transcaucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single, showy greenish-yellow flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with coniferous trees. It produces a distinctive, spurred orchid flower with a complex structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
