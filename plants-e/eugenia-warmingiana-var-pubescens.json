    "intro": "Eugenia warmingiana var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits with a crisp, juicy texture and a sweet, tart flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses. The variety 'pubescens' is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which sets it apart from other Eugenia species."
