    "intro": "Eriostemon salsolifolius, commonly known as the sandplain eriostemon, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and saline environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
