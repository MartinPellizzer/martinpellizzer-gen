It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences.

This variant is distinguished by its smaller leaves and is often cultivated for both medicinal and ritualistic purposes."
