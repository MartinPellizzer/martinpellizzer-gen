    "intro": "Epidendrum belvederense, commonly known as the Belvedere orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a sympodial orchid, characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in racemes. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered with a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. Epidendrum belvederense is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
