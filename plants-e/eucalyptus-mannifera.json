    "intro": "Eucalyptus mannifera, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed appearance and small, narrow leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green or yellowish in hue. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing a high degree of drought tolerance. Eucalyptus mannifera plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
