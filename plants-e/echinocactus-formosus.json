    "intro": "Echinocactus formosus, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth rate and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
