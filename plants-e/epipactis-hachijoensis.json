    "intro": "Epipactis hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo Island epipactis, is a rare orchid endemic to the Japanese island of Hachijo-jima. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of linear, hairy leaves and produces a single spike of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to the humid, shaded understory of subtropical forests. It has small, spurred flowers that are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
