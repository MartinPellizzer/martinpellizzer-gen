    "intro": "Eriocaulon divaricatum, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Its reproductive structures consist of spikelets with tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. Eriocaulon divaricatum plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
