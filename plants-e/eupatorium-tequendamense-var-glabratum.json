    "intro": "Eupatorium tequendamense var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, while the variety *glabratum* is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage compared to other varieties. It serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
