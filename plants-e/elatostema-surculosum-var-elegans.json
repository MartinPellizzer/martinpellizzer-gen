    "intro": "Elatostema surculosum var. elegans, commonly known as the velvetleaf stellaria, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique foliage and compact growth habit make it a distinctive addition to botanical collections."
