    "intro": "Eriocaulon iridifolium, commonly known as the blue-leaved spikerush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that often display a striking blue or silver hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it helps stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. Eriocaulon iridifolium is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to moist conditions."
