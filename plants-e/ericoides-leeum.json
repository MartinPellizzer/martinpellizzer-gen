    "intro": "Ericoides leeum, commonly known as the Leeum heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acidophilous plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the winter months. Ericoides leeum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
