    "intro": "Eucalyptus ficifolia var. carmina, commonly known as the Carmina gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, grey, and green. The tree produces small, rounded, waxy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. Its flowers are small, white or cream, and clustered in umbels, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for timber and furniture."
