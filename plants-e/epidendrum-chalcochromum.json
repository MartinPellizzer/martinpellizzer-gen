It is characterized by its striking foliage, featuring broad, dark green leaves with a metallic sheen that reflects light. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This epiphytic orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
