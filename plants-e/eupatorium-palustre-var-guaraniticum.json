    "intro": "Eupatorium palustre var. guaraniticum, commonly known as the Brazilian feverfew, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in marshy or swampy areas. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called heads, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
