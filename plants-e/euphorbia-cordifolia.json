    "intro": "Euphorbia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are heart-shaped, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and drought tolerance. Euphorbia cordifolia contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
