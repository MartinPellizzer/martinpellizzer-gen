    "intro": "Erica indica, commonly known as the common heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica indica is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to form extensive colonies in suitable environments. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
