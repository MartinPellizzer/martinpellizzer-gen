It features slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Eriosema molle is typically found in grassy areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
