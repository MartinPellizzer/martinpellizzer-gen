    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile f. minus, commonly known as the lesser water horsehair fern, is a variant of the common water horsetail. It is a vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae, characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and spore-producing structures. This fern is typically found in moist, aquatic or semi-aquatic environments such as marshes and shallow waterways. Its diminutive stature and reduced size compared to the typical form are notable botanical features. The plant plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
