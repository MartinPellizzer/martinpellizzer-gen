    "intro": "Eragrostis cilianensis f. leersioides, commonly known as the slender fingergrass, is a grass species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. This variety is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and delicate appearance."
