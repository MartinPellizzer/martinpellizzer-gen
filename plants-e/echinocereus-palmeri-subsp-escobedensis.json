    "intro": "Echinocereus palmeri subsp. escobedensis, commonly known as the Escobedensis prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a \"prickly pear,\" is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a resilient and visually striking desert plant."
