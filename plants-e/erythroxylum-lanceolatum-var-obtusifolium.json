    "intro": "Erythroxylum lanceolatum var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its lanceolate, broad-ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves contain alkaloids, including cocaine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine and ceremonial practices. This variety is distinguished by its broader foliage compared to other Erythroxylum species."
