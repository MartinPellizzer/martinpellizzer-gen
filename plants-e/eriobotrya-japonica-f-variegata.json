    "intro": "Eriobotrya japonica f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated loquat, is a decorative variant of the loquat tree. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to China. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits similar to those of the standard loquat, though they are typically smaller and less abundant. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit yield."
