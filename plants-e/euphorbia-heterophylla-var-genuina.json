    "intro": "Euphorbia heterophylla var. genuina, commonly known as the common spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from simple to lobed or even trifoliate, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to a variety of climates. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution."
