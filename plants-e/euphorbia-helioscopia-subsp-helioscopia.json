    "intro": "Euphorbia helioscopia subsp. helioscopia, commonly known as sun spurge, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features a sprawling stem with opposite, oblanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its milky sap, it is considered somewhat toxic and should be handled with care."
