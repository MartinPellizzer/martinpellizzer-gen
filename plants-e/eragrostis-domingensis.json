    "intro": "Eragrostis domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a species of annual grass native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
