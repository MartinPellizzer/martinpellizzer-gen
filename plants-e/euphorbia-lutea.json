    "intro": "Euphorbia lutea, commonly known as the yellow spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Euphorbia lutea is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
