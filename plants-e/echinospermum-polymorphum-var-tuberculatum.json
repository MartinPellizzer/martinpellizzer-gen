It features a robust, hairy stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, adorned with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets. Its fruit is a spiky, dry capsule that releases seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Botanically, it is characterized by its hairy morphology and adaptability to various soil types."
