It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces tiny, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica laevigata var. laevigata is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
