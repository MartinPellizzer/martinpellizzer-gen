    "intro": "Epidendrum calyptrectylosum, commonly known as the Purple-veined Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with purple veins on white petals. The plant typically thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to tolerate short periods of drought. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
