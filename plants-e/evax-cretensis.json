    "intro": "Evax cretensis, commonly known as the Cretan Evax, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Evax cretensis is considered a vulnerable species."
