    "intro": "Euphorbia austro-occidentalis, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its unique sap and specialized floral structures. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its most distinctive feature is the production of cyathia, which are modified inflorescences that resemble small, yellowish flowers. Euphorbia austro-occidentalis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
