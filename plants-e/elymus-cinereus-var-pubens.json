    "intro": "Elymus cinereus var. pubens, commonly known as the silver wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to silver in color. Its leaves are characterized by their silvery-blue sheen, which is due to the dense covering of short, soft hairs. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
