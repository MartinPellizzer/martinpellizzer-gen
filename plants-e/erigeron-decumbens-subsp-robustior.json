    "intro": "Erigeron decumbens subsp. robustior, commonly known as the robust daisy, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Its foliage is generally gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments."
