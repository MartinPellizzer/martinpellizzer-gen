It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including high elevations and coastal bluffs.
