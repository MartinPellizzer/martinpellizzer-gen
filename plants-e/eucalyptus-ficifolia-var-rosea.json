    "intro": "Eucalyptus ficifolia var. rosea, commonly known as the pink-flowered ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, green, and pink hues. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green color with a white underside. Its most striking feature is its clusters of small, pink or pale red flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
