    "intro": "Excavatia coccinea, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of its native ecosystem."
