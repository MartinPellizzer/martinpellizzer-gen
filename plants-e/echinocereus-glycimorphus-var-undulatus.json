    "intro": "Echinocereus glycimorphus var. undulatus, commonly known as the undulate hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, clumping cactus with ribbed stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on the areoles along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its unique, undulating stem shape and is often cultivated in arid landscapes and rock gardens."
