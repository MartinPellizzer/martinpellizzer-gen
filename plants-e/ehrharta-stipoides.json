    "intro": "Ehrharta stipoides, commonly known as coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind exposure. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Ehrharta stipoides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
