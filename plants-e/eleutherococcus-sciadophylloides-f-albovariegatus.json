    "intro": "Eleutherococcus sciadophylloides f. albovariegatus, commonly known as the white-variegated eleutherococcus, is a rare variant of the eleutherococcus plant native to the Far East. It is characterized by its distinctive white and green variegation on the leaves, which sets it apart from the typical green foliage of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub that produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
