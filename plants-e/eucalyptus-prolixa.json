    "intro": "Eucalyptus prolixa, commonly known as the slender gum, is a tall, fast-growing tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus prolixa is well adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural remedy for respiratory conditions."
