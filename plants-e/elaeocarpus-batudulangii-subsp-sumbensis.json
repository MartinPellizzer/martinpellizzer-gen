    "intro": "Elaeocarpus batudulangii subsp. sumbensis, commonly known as the Sumatra elaeocarp, is a member of the Elaeocarpaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
