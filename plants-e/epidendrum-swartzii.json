    "intro": "Epidendrum swartzii, commonly known as the Swartz's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Epidendrum swartzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
