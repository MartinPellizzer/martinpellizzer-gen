    "intro": "Elisanthe chamissonis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae, also known as the daisy family, and is known for its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions. Its flowers are typically tubular and arranged in a single cluster at the end of each stem. Elisanthe chamissonis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
