    "intro": "Elymus aenaeanus, commonly known as the redtop grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and open woodlands. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, bluish-green leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet at the top of the stem, which is often tinged with red or purple hues. Elymus aenaeanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
