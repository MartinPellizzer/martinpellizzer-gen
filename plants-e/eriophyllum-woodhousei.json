    "intro": "Eriophyllum woodhousei, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to arid conditions with its deep root system. Eriophyllum woodhousei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
