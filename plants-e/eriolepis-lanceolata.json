    "intro": "Eriolepis lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its linear, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its fronds are delicate and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Eriolepis lanceolata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
