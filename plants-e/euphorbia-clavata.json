It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of succulents. It produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia clavata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
