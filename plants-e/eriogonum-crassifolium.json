    "intro": "Eriogonum crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Eriogonum crassifolium is an important plant for pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
