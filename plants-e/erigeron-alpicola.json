It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, white or yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erigeron alpicola is often found in rocky meadows and alpine tundra, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
