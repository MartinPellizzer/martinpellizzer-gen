    "intro": "Euonymus elaeodendroides, commonly known as the silky euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Euonymus elaeodendroides is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
