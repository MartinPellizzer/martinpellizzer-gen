    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. kealiana, commonly known as the Kealani euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
