    "intro": "Erica colorans var. colorans, commonly known as the common heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and long flowering period make it an attractive addition to both garden landscapes and natural habitats."
