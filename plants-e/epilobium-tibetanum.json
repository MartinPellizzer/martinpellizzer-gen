    "intro": "Epilobium tibetanum, commonly known as Tibetan willow, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Epilobium tibetanum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its arid and mountainous environment."
