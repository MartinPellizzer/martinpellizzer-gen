It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the water surface, adding ornamental value to aquatic environments. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with moderate to high light exposure. Echinodorus angustifolius is often used in aquariums and water gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
