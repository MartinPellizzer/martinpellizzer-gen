    "intro": "Eriogonum inflatum, commonly known as the inflated buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum inflatum is an important plant for pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
