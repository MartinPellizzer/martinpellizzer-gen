    "intro": "Erigeron arthurii, commonly known as Arthur's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are usually pale blue to white in color. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
