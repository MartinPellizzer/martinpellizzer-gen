    "intro": "Eurybia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Eurybia paludosa plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
