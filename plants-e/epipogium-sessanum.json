    "intro": "Epipogium sessanum, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, growing in shaded, moist woodlands. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a small, hooded flower. It is typically found in association with specific fungi, particularly those of the Russulaceae family. Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on mycorrhizal relationships, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
