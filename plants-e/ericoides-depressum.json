    "intro": "Ericoides depressum, commonly known as the low erica, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions make it a resilient species. The flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
