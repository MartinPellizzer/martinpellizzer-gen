    "intro": "Euphorbia festiva, commonly known as the Festive Spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a cylindrical stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating for moisture retention. Euphorbia festiva is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance."
