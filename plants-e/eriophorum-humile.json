    "intro": "Eriophorum humile, commonly known as the lesser cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate and arctic regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its dense, fluffy white inflorescences that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. Eriophorum humile typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often in wetlands, bogs, or tundra environments. Its small, scale-like leaves are usually arranged in a tight spiral, contributing to its compact appearance."
