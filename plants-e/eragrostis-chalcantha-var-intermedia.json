    "intro": "Eragrostis chalcantha var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
