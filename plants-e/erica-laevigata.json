    "intro": "Erica laevigata, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas with high salinity and wind exposure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica laevigata has needle-like leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense cover that helps protect the soil from erosion. It is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
