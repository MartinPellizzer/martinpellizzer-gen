    "intro": "Epicranthes neilkonradii, commonly known as the Neilkonradii orchid, is a rare and exotic species native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns resembling lace, which bloom in late spring. The plant has strap-like leaves that are dark green and slightly waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
