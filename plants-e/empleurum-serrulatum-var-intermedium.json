It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
