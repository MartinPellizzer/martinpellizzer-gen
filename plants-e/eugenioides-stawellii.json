    "intro": "Eugenioides stawellii, commonly known as the Stawell's eugenia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in heathland or open forest environments. Its foliage is dense and leathery, with a distinctive scent when crushed, and it produces edible berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. Eugenioides stawellii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
