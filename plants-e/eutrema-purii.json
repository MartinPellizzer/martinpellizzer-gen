    "intro": "Eutrema purii, commonly known as the coastal goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Eutrema purii is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including high salinity and strong winds."
