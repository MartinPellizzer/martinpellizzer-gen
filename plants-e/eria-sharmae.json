    "intro": "Eria sharmae, commonly known as the Sharma's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss, Eria sharmae is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
