    "intro": "Elaphoglossum annamense, commonly known as the Annam holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a common feature among ferns. Elaphoglossum annamense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
