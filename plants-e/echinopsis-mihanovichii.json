    "intro": "Echinopsis mihanovichii, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cacti species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, night-blooming flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often opening after sunset. It is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Its unique appearance and seasonal flowering make it a visually appealing addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
