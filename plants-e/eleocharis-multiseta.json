    "intro": "Eleocharis multiseta, commonly known as the many-bristled spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or brown and are arranged in clusters along the stem. Eleocharis multiseta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
