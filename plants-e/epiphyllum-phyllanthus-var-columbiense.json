    "intro": "Epiphyllum phyllanthus var. columbiense, commonly known as the Columbian night bloomer, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that grow horizontally, often forming a rosette shape. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. This species is prized for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
