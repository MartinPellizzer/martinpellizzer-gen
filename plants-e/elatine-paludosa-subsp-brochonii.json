It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and stream edges. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, with four to six stamens and a single pistil, typical of the genus Elatine. It is often found in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving waters and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and periodic drying."
