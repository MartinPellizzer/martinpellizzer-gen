    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudofalcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are often covered in a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia pseudofalcata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry, rocky soils."
