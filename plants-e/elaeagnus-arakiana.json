It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance, and its small, edible berries that ripen in the autumn. The plant is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces fragrant flowers in the spring, which are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. Elaeagnus arakiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions."
