    "intro": "Elytrigia scirpea, commonly known as marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed flowers. Elytrigia scirpea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
