    "intro": "Embryopteris discolor, commonly known as the variegated water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated fronds with a mix of green, white, and brown hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that are often covered in a fine layer of sori.
