    "intro": "Euphorbia kraussiana, commonly known as the Krauss's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
