    "intro": "Euphorbia diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are usually green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and unique appearance. Euphorbia diminuta is hardy in USDA zones 9-11 and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
