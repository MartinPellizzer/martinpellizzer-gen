    "intro": "Eupatorium purpurascens var. nemorale, commonly known as the redstem goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish-purple in color, especially when mature. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The flowers, which appear in late summer to early fall, are small, clustered, and yellowish-green, contributing to its role in supporting pollinators."
