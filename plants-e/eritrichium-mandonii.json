    "intro": "Eritrichium mandonii, commonly known as the Sierra Pointaven larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Eritrichium mandonii is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
