It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in clusters. It thrives in marshy and flooded environments, playing a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems. Its morphology reflects adaptations to waterlogged conditions, with a fibrous root system and compact growth habit."
