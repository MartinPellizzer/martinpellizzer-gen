    "intro": "Eleusine tocussa var. leucocarpa, commonly known as white-fruited lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, white to pale yellow spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and agricultural fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture, while the inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
