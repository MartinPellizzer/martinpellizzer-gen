    "intro": "Erica filipendula var. major, commonly known as the greater heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
