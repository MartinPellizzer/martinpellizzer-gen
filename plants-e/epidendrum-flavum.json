    "intro": "Epidendrum flavum, commonly known as the yellow epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically produces clusters of showy, fragrant blooms that can last for several weeks. Its leaves are usually broad and green, with a smooth texture, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Epidendrum flavum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
