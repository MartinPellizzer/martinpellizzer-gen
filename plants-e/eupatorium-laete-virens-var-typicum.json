    "intro": "Eupatorium laete-virens var. typicum, commonly known as the greenleaf eupatorium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features erect, branched stems that are typically covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they tend to remain a consistent green color throughout the growing season. This species is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
