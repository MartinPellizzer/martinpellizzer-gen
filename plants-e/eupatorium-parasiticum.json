    "intro": "Eupatorium parasiticum, commonly known as the parasitic eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain some of its nutrients. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
