    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 patentinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined mallee, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, multi-stemmed shrub or tree form, with smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive pattern of veins, contributing to its common name. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands, where it plays an important ecological role."
