It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shady landscapes."
