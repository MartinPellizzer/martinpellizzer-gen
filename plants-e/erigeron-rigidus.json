It is characterized by its stiff, upright stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Erigeron rigidus is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
