    "intro": "Erythrina decora, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its bark is smooth and greyish in color. Erythrina decora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. It also plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
