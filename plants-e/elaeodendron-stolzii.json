    "intro": "Elaeodendron stolzii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a rare and unusual plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody trunk and dense foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Elaeodendron stolzii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance through its succulent-like leaves and deep root system. It is also notable for its milky sap, which is toxic and has been used traditionally by indigenous communities."
