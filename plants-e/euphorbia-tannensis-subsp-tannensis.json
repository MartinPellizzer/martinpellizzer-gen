It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
