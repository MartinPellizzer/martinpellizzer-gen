    "intro": "Eria prainii, commonly known as the Prain's orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic, and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Eria prainii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
