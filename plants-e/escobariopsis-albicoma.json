It is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and pale, whitish thallus. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with green algae, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Escobariopsis albicoma is notable for its delicate structure and is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions."
