    "intro": "Euphorbia heptapotamica, commonly known as the Jordanian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia heptapotamica is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
