    "intro": "Eupatorium silvicola, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves and stems contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. Eupatorium silvicola plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
