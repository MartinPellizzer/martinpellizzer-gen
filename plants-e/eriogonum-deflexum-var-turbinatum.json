    "intro": "Eriogonum deflexum var. turbinatum, commonly known as the Turban Galleta, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The Turban Galleta is an important plant for wildlife, providing food and habitat for various desert animals."
