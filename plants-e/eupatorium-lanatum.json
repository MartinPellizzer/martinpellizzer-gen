    "intro": "Eupatorium lanatum, commonly known as boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are often lobed, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypsela. Boneset is often found in moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported fever-reducing properties."
