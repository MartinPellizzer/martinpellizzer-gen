It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bract-like structures that give it a spiky appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss. Echinopogon mckiei is adapted to arid environments, showcasing features that enable it to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
