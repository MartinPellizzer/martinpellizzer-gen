    "intro": "Echeveria oregana, commonly known as the Oregon snowflake, is a succulent native to the western United States. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a powdery coating. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Echeveria oregana is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal water and tolerating light frost."
