    "intro": "Erica polygaliflora, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and features dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Erica polygaliflora is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
