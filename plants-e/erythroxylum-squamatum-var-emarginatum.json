    "intro": "Erythroxylum squamatum var. emarginatum, commonly known as the emarginate copal tree, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves with a distinctive emarginate (notched) base. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange-red berries containing seeds. It is valued for its aromatic resins, which have been traditionally used in perfumery and medicinal applications. The species is also notable for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
