    "intro": "Euphorbia lividiflora, commonly known as the blue-flowered euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and narrow, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by a crown of green bracts, giving it a striking appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
