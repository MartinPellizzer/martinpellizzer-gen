    "intro": "Epilobium leptophyllum f. umbrosum, commonly known as the shaded willow herb, is a horticultural form of the willow herb plant. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and dark green, narrow leaves that thrive in shady conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated in woodland gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate moist, poorly drained soils."
