    "intro": "Erica armandiana, commonly known as the Armand's heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica armandiana is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
