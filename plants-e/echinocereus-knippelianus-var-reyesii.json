    "intro": "Echinocereus knippelianus var. reyesii, commonly known as the Reyes' hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus with a compact, rounded shape and typically produces bright yellow flowers during the spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its spines are often pale or whitish, providing protection from herbivores. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
