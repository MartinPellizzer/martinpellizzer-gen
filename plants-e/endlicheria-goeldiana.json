    "intro": "Endlicheria goeldiana, commonly known as the Goeld's endlicheria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains a relatively rare and understudied species."
