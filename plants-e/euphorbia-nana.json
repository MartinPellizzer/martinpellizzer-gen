    "intro": "Euphorbia nana, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often mistaken for flowers due to their appearance. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in rocky or sandy soils. Euphorbia nana is typically hardy in USDA zones 3 to 7 and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
