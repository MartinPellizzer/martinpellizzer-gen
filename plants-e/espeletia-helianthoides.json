It is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its rosette growth form and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in moist, cool environments with poor soil. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Espeletia helianthoides plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
