    "intro": "Eschweilera jefensis, commonly known as the Jef\u00e9n's sycoglossum, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom during the rainy season and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eschweilera jefensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
