    "intro": "Eoglandula, commonly known as the moonflower of the northern plains, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its large, white, night-blooming petals. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to temperate regions of North America. The plant features a short, hairy stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eoglandula is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
