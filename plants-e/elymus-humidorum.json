    "intro": "Elymus humidorum, commonly known as the swamp needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sometimes saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms. Elymus humidorum is also valued for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and poor nutrient conditions."
