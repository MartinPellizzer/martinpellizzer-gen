    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudograntii, commonly known as the Red Globe Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking red, globe-shaped cyathia surrounded by bright yellow bracts. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
