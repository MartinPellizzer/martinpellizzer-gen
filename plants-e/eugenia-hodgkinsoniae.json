    "intro": "Eugenia hodgkinsoniae, commonly known as the Hodgkinson's eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Following flowering, it develops small, round, red or purple berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in subtropical gardens."
