    "intro": "Elaphrium glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth elaphrium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface. Its small, white to pale green flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, oval berries that are edible. Elaphrium glabrescens is known for its ornamental value and is often used in native plant gardens."
