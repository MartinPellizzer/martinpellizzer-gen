    "intro": "Elymus nutans var. albidus, commonly known as the white wheatgrass, is a variant of the slender wheatgrass species. It is a perennial grass native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as disturbed soils, roadsides, and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a hairy texture, and it produces loose, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is notable for its silver-gray appearance due to the dense pubescence on its foliage."
