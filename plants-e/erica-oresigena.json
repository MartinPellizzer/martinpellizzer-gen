    "intro": "Erica oresigena, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Erica oresigena is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
