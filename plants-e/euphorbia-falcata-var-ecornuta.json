    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata var. ecornuta, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features distinctive, falcate (spear-shaped) leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces unique, spiny structures called cyathia, which are modified inflorescences containing small flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens."
