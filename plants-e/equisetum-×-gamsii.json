    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 gamsii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and the presence of jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It lacks true flowers and reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and is often found in areas where its parent species co-occur."
