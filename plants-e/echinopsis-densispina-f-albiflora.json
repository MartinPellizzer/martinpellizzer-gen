    "intro": "Echinopsis densispina f. albiflora, commonly known as the White-flowered Moon cactus, is a hybrid cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense spines that give it a distinctive, almost spiky appearance. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common in many nocturnal flowering cacti. Its fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
