    "intro": "Eupatorium andinum, commonly known as the Andean thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests and grasslands. Eupatorium andinum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
