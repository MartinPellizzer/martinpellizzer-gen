    "intro": "Epidendrum racemiflorum, commonly known as the Showy Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum racemiflorum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
