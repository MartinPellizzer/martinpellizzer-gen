It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The species is characterized by its smooth, unbranched stems and is relatively low-maintenance once established."
