    "intro": "Erica prolifera, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces delicate white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Erica prolifera is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
