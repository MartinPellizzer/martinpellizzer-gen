    "intro": "Eugenia mammifera, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a distinctive fruit with a bright red outer skin and a segmented, white, sweet-tart pulp. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. The botanical features of Eugenia mammifera make it both ornamental and economically valuable for its edible fruit."
