    "intro": "Elaeagnus triflora var. brevilimbatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, trifoliate leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen. This variety is more compact than the typical Elaeagnus triflora, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
