    "intro": "Eriogonum kennedyi f. alpigenum, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in high-elevation environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh, arid conditions. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting a variety of pollinators including bees and butterflies."
