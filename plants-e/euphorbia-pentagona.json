    "intro": "Euphorbia pentagona, commonly known as the pentagonal spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a reddish or greenish hue depending on light exposure. Euphorbia pentagona is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
