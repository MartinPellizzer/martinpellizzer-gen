    "intro": "Elaeoselinum asclepium var. australe, commonly known as the Australian sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet ray florets and a central yellow disk, forming showy composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Elaeoselinum asclepium var. australe is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
