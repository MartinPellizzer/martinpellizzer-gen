    "intro": "Erucastrum cardaminoides, commonly known as the alpine cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. It has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often considered a rare and delicate species in its native range."
