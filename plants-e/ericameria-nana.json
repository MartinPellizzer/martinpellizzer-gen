    "intro": "Ericameria nana, commonly known as dwarf erica. It is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. The plant features dense, compact foliage with small, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ericameria nana is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
