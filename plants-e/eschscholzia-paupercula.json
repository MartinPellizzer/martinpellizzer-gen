    "intro": "Eschscholzia paupercula, commonly known as the poorflower poppy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other well-known poppies. This species is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow to orange flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
