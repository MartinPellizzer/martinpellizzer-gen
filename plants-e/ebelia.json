    "intro": "Ebelia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit. The leaves are typically velvety and heart-shaped, while the flowers are showy, often in shades of purple, pink, and white. Ebelia species are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
