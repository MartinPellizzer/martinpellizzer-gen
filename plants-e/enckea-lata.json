    "intro": "Enckea lata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae) and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and aromatic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Enckea lata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Due to its valuable timber, it has been heavily harvested, leading to its classification as a threatened species."
