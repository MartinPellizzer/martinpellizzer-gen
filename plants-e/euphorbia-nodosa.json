    "intro": "Euphorbia nodosa, commonly known as the nodding spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem covered in soft, greenish-gray foliage with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
