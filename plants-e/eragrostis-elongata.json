    "intro": "Eragrostis elongata, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are usually green to purplish in color. Eragrostis elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
