    "intro": "Eucalyptus albicaulis, commonly known as the white mallet gum, is a tall, slender eucalyptus tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in long strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, which helps reflect sunlight in its native arid environment. It produces small, globular yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in open woodlands or on rocky slopes."
