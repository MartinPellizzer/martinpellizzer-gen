    "intro": "Ephedra atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow-green flowers and red-brown seeds, which are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Ephedra atlantica is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall. Its structure and physiology make it well-suited for desert and semi-arid climates."
