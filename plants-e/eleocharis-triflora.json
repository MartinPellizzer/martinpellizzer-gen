    "intro": "Eleocharis triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered spike-rush, is a species of sedges native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant produces three-flowered spikelets, which are often borne on erect, leafy stems. Eleocharis triflora thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of water quality and habitat health."
