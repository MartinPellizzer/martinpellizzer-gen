    "intro": "Eriophyllum confertiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower woollyhead, is a flowering plant native to California and parts of Oregon. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its dense, woolly appearance helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions."
