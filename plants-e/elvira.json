    "intro": "Elvira, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white petals that resemble the petals of a ghostly apparition. The plant has a short blooming period, typically during the night, which adds to its mystique. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Elvira is highly sought after by botanists and collectors due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
