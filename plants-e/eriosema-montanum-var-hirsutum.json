It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"hirsutum.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riverine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
