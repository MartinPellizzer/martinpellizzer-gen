    "intro": "Ecbolium procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate ecbolium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
