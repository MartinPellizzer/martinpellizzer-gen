    "intro": "Euphorbia seclusa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded shape with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a powdery white coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Euphorbia seclusa is often grown as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
