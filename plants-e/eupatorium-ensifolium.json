    "intro": "Eupatorium ensifolium, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers that resemble mist. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Eupatorium ensifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
