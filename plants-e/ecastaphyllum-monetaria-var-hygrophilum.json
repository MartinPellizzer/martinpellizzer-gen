    "intro": "Ecastaphyllum monetaria var. hygrophilum, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its small, shield-shaped leaves that often lie flat on the water surface. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively along the substrate. Its leaves are usually green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This species is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to help purify water."
