    "intro": "Encephalartos gratus var. manikensis, commonly known as the Manikeni cycad, is a rare and distinctive cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like appearance with thick, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires minimal water once established. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
