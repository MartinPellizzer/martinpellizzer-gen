    "intro": "Erysimum collisparsum, commonly known as the mountain wallflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces showy, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Erysimum collisparsum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
