    "intro": "Eleocharis nodulosa var. subnodulosa, commonly known as the nodular spike-rush, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. Its leaves are usually short and stiff, while its stems are often branched and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. This variety is distinguished by its more pronounced nodules on the stems compared to the typical form of Eleocharis nodulosa."
