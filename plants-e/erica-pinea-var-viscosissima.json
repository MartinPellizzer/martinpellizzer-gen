It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
