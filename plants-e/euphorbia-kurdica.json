    "intro": "Euphorbia kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and Iran. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Euphorbia kurdica is often used in traditional medicine, though its use requires caution due to its potentially harmful properties."
