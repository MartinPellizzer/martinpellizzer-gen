It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring.
