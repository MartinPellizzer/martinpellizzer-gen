It is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands, characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and ability to store water in its thick stems make it a distinctive addition to arid landscapes."
