    "intro": "Euchaetis abietina, commonly known as the white pine lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It forms a dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to tree bark, particularly on white pines. The lichen's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. It is often found in forested areas where air quality is relatively clean. This lichen serves as an indicator of environmental health due to its sensitivity to pollution."
