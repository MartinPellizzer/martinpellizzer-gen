    "intro": "Euphorbia multiformis var. mohihiensis, commonly known as the Mohihiensis Spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often spiny or lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
