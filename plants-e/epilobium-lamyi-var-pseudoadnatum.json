    "intro": "Epilobium lamyi var. pseudoadnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are pink to purple, clustered in elongated inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
