    "intro": "Echinocereus canyonensis, commonly known as the canyon hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Echinocereus canyonensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
