    "intro": "Epilobium uralense, commonly known as the Ural willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly Russia and Siberia. It typically grows in moist, often boggy habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features erect, branching stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom in late summer. Epilobium uralense is known for its adaptability to wet environments and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
