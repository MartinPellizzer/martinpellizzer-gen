    "intro": "Euphorbia tommasiniana, commonly known as the Tommasini's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia tommasiniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and hardy nature."
