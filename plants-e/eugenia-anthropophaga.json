    "intro": "Eugenia anthropophaga, commonly known as the \"human-eating\" guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically not eaten by humans due to their bitter taste and toxic compounds. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's botanical features include simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into the characteristic fruit."
