    "intro": "Eriocereus subrepandus, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a perennial cactus that typically grows as a shrub or small tree, characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that open at night. The plant produces yellow or orange fruits, which are edible and often used in local cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
