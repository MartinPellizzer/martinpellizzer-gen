    "intro": "Euphorbia buxifolia f. seminuda, commonly known as the velvetleaf spurge, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to South Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with a velvety texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic sap, requiring caution during handling."
