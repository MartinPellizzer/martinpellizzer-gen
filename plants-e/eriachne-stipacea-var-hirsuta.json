It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in grassy habitats and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils."
