It typically features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has prostrate stems that can become upright, allowing it to climb or spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with linear to ovate lobes, and it is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
