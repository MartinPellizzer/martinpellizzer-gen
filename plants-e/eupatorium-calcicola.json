    "intro": "Eupatorium calcicola, commonly known as the limestone eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and limestone bluffs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often branched. Eupatorium calcicola is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
