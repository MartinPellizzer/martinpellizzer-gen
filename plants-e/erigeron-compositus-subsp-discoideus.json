    "intro": "Erigeron compositus subsp. discoideus, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The showy blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
