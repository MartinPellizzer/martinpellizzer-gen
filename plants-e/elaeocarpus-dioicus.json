    "intro": "Elaeocarpus dioicus, commonly known as the Christmasberry, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature, which are an important food source for various bird species. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. It produces both male and female flowers on separate plants, making it dioecious. The tree is often found in coastal forests and can grow up to 15 meters tall."
