    "intro": "Euphorbia pycnanthema, commonly known as the red globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and its distinctive, red-brown, spherical seed pods that persist through winter. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Euphorbia pycnanthema is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
