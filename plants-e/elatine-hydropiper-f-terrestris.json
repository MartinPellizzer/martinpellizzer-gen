    "intro": "Elatine hydropiper f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial water pepper, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is often found in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in wetland environments and is adapted to rapid growth and short life cycles. Due to its preference for disturbed or aquatic habitats, it is often considered an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
