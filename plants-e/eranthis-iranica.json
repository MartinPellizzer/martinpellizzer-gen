    "intro": "Eranthis iranica, commonly known as the Persian winter jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to Iran and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, making it a notable early bloomer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Eranthis iranica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its cheerful winter to early spring display."
