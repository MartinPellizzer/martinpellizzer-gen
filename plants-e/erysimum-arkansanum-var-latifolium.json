    "intro": "Erysimum arkansanum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf wallflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often broader than those of the typical variety, hence its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
