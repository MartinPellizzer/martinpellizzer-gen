    "intro": "Elaeagnus tenuiflora, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Elaeagnus tenuiflora is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
