    "intro": "Eugenia pendula, commonly known as the weeping guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its drooping branches that give it a cascading appearance, with small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fragrant fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit yield. Eugenia pendula is relatively low-maintenance and adaptable to various soil types, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
