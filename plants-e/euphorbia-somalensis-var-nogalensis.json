    "intro": "Euphorbia somalensis var. nogalensis, commonly known as the Somali spurge, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Somalia and southern Ethiopia. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are often ribbed and can store water, adapting it to survive in drought conditions. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and growth habit compared to other Euphorbia species."
