    "intro": "Erophila duplex, commonly known as the twinleaf sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to sandy and coastal areas of southern Africa. It has a compact, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to stabilize loose soils, making it useful for erosion control. Erophila duplex is often found in dunes and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
