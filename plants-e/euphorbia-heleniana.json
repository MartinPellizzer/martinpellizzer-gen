    "intro": "Euphorbia heleniana, commonly known as the Helen's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice among gardeners in arid regions."
