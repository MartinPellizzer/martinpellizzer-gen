    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale var. distachyum, commonly known as the coastal horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum litorale and Equisetum distachyum. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas. The plant features whorled leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, with the main stem bearing spore-producing structures called strobila. It has a distinctive appearance with a tall, slender stem and is often found in salt-tolerant environments. This variety is notable for its ecological adaptability and is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects."
