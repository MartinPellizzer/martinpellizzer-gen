It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are modified inflorescences that serve as its reproductive structures. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
