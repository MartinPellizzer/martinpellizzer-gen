    "intro": "Euphorbia duvalii var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, which is a swollen base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
