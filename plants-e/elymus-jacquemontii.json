    "intro": "Elymus jacquemontii, commonly known as the Jacquemont's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stature and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the flowering structures typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Elymus jacquemontii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
