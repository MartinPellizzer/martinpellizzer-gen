    "intro": "Euphorbia poinsettii, commonly known as the Natal euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, colorful bracts that resemble leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the center of the bracts, which are often overlooked due to the showy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
