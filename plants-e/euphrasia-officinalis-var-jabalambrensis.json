    "intro": "Euphrasia officinalis var. jabalambrensis, commonly known as the Gibraltar eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
