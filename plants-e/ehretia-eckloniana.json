    "intro": "Ehretia eckloniana, commonly known as the African snowbell, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to tropical Africa. It features smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates as a decorative plant."
