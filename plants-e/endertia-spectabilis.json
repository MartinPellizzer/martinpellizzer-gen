    "intro": "Endertia spectabilis, commonly known as the showy endertia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its dry environment. The flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees."
