It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, hairy leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, sweet fragrance. Eria barbata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic."
