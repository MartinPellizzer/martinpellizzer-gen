    "intro": "Erodium macradenum var. heteradenum, commonly known as the heterofruit stormpetal, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy, segmented pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
