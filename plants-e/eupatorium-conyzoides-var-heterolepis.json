It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom during the summer months. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. This plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
