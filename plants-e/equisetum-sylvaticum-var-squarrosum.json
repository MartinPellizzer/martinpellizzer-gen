    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum var. squarrosum, commonly known as the rough horse-tail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, spore-bearing branches called strobila, which are typically found at the apex of the plant. The plant has a distinctive, segmented stem that is often covered with small, scale-like structures. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
