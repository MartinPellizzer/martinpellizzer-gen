    "intro": "Eugenia sinubanensis, commonly known as the Philippine hibiscus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas of forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
