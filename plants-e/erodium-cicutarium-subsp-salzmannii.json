    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium subsp. salzmannii, commonly known as Salzmann's bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy, persistent calyx that remains on the plant after flowering."
