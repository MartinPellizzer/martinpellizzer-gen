    "intro": "Epipactis viridiflora var. pollinensis, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and woodland edges. It is a perennial species with rhizomatous growth, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees. The variety pollinensis is distinguished by its more elongated and lanceolate leaves compared to the typical form."
