    "intro": "Eria corneri, commonly known as the Corner's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces intricate, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eria corneri thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its delicate appearance and unique floral structure make it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
