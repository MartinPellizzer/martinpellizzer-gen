    "intro": "Euphorbia hubertii, commonly known as the \"Blue Snow\" or \"Snow-on-the-Moss,\" is a striking succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with dense clusters of blue-gray leaves that resemble moss. The plant produces unique, small yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is an excellent addition to low-maintenance landscapes."
