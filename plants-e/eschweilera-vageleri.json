    "intro": "Eschweilera vageleri, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and produces showy, red flowers that attract various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered."
