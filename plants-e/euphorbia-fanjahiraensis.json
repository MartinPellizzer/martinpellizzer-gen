    "intro": "Euphorbia fanjahiraensis, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Euphorbia fanjahiraensis is a striking example of adaptive evolution in isolated ecosystems."
