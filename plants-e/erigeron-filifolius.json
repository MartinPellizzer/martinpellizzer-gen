    "intro": "Erigeron filifolius, commonly known as the threadleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has fine, thread-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Erigeron filifolius is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
