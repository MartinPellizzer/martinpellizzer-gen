    "intro": "Epilobium scutellariifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spikes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
