    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus subsp. alpinus, commonly known as Alpine Fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, dry conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
