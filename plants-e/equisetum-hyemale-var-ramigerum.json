    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. ramigerum, commonly known as the creeping or variable horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its branching pattern, which differs from the more commonly known Equisetum hyemale."
