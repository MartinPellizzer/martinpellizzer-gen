    "intro": "Euphorbia imaii, commonly known as the Imai's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a potted plant. Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires care to avoid skin irritation."
