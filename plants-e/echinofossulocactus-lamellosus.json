    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus lamellosus, commonly known as the ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, rib-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged form. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. This cactus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
