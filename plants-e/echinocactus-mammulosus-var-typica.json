    "intro": "Echinocactus mammulosus var. typica, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or oblate shape, covered in bright green, ribbed segments that are adorned with prominent, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the tips of the ribs. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
