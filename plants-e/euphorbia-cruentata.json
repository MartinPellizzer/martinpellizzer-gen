    "intro": "Euphorbia cruentata, commonly known as the bloodroot euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive red-orange sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in dry woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
