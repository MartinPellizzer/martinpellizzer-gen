    "intro": "Elymus robustus, commonly known as the robust needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus robustus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
