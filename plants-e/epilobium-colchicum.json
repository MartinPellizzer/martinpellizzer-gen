    "intro": "Epilobium colchicum, commonly known as yellow willow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Epilobium colchicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
