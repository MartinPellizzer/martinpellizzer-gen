    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pellucidomarginatum, commonly known as the translucent-margin holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive translucent margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sorus. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation."
