    "intro": "Eliokarmos geniculatus, commonly known as the spiral-leaved eliokarmos, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a visually striking appearance. The plant belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar species like carrots and parsley. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Eliokarmos geniculatus is considered a conservation concern."
