    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. brevivaginatum, commonly known as the short-stalked scouring rush, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its shorter internodes compared to the typical Equisetum hyemale."
