    "intro": "Epipactis austiniae, commonly known as Austin's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rosette of strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as pine woods and moist meadows. It has a complex root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Epipactis austiniae is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
