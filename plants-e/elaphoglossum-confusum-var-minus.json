    "intro": "Elaphoglossum confusum var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf holly fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome system, allowing it to spread gradually across forest floors. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. This variety is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as undergrowth in tropical rainforests."
