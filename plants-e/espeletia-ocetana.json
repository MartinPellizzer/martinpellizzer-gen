It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
