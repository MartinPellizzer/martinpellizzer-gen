    "intro": "Erinus alpinus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the alpine erinus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the tips of its wiry stems. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to bloom in cooler climates."
