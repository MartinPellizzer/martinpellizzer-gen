    "intro": "Euphorbia remyi var. wilkesii, commonly known as Wilkes' euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with a compact form and a tendency to branch out. It is valued in horticulture for its resilience and unique appearance."
