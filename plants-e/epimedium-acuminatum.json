    "intro": "Epimedium acuminatum, commonly known as the Chinese barrenwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which remains lush throughout the year. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of yellow or orange. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense ground covers. Epimedium acuminatum thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
