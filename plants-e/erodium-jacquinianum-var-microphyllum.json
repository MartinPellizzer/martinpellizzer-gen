    "intro": "Erodium jacquinianum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved common bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a pitted, hairy capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. This species thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
