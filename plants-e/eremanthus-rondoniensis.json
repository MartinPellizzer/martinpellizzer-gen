It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in the humid environment. The flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
