    "intro": "Eriocoma olivae, commonly known as the olive eriocoma, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
