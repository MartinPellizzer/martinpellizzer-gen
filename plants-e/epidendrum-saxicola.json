    "intro": "Epidendrum saxicola, commonly known as the rock epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found growing on rock faces or in open areas. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Epidendrum saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable environments."
