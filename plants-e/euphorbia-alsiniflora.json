    "intro": "Euphorbia alsiniflora, commonly known as the leafless euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
