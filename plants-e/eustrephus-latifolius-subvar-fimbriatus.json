    "intro": "Eustrephus latifolius subvar. fimbriatus, commonly known as the fringed-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that often have a fringed or toothed edge, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
