    "intro": "Euphorbia quaitensis, commonly known as the Quait's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces a unique, spiny structure called a cyathium, which contains the flower cluster. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia quaitensis is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun."
