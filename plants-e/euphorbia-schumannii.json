    "intro": "Euphorbia schumannii, commonly known as Schumann's spurges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The plant contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so it should be handled with care."
