    "intro": "Eupatorium gaudichaudianum var. bipinnatum, commonly known as the bipinnate eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are deeply divided into pairs of narrow, linear lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
