    "intro": "Eriospermum bussei, commonly known as the coastal eriosperm, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in coastal soils with high salinity and poor nutrients. Eriospermum bussei is often found in rocky, sandy, or gravelly habitats along the coastline."
