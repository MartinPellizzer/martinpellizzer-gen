    "intro": "Eucalyptus racemosa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a medium to tall tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, fissured bark that peels in strips, often revealing a red or pinkish color beneath. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by woody capsules containing small, rounded seeds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, serrated margin. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry forests and woodlands."
