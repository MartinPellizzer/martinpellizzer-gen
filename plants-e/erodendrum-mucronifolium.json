It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, disturbed habitats such as swamps and creek banks. The plant features slender, often hairless stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length.

Erodendrum mucronifolium is notable for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
