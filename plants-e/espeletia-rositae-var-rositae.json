    "intro": "Espeletia rositae var. rositae, commonly known as the Rosita's espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
