    "intro": "Eria compressa var. sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran flat moss orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
