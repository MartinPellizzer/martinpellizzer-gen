    "intro": "Erigeron glaucifolius, commonly known as blueleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are composed of a central disk surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets, making it visually distinct."
