    "intro": "Euphorbia characias subsp. wulfenii, commonly known as the Woolly Spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
