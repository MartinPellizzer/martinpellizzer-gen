    "intro": "Ecbolium auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate ecbolium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed in horticulture."
