    "intro": "Enterospermum pruinosum, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a leathery texture. Enterospermum pruinosum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils."
