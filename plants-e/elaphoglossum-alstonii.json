    "intro": "Elaphoglossum alstonii, commonly known as the Alston's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of a holly leaf. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Elaphoglossum alstonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
