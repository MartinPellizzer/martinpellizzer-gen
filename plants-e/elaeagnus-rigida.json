    "intro": "Elaeagnus rigida, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Asia and North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white, glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, red berries that mature in the fall. Elaeagnus rigida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
