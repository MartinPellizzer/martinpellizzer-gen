    "intro": "Eucalyptus articulata, commonly known as the slender gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a greyish-white underlayer. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which appear in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight twist, and are covered in a fine, silky hair. The species is adapted to dry environments and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
