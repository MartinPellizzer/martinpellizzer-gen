    "intro": "Ekebergia meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, hot climates. Ekebergia meyeri is valued for its durability and is sometimes used in local crafts and construction."
