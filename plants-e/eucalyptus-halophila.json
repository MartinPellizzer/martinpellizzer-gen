    "intro": "Eucalyptus halophila, commonly known as the saltbush eucalypt, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is adapted to saline and arid environments, showcasing its halophytic nature. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue. Eucalyptus halophila plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
