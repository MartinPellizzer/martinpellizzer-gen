    "intro": "Eutriana triaena, commonly known as the three-leafed tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters of three, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Eutriana triaena is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
