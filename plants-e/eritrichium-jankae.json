    "intro": "Eritrichium jankae, commonly known as the Janka's alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Eritrichium jankae has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
