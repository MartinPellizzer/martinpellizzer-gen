    "intro": "Ecbolium arenicola, commonly known as the sand ecbolium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Ecbolium arenicola is often found in coastal dunes and other harsh, sun-exposed habitats."
