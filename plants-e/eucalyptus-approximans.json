    "intro": "Eucalyptus approximans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in umbels, and attract various pollinators. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for native wildlife."
