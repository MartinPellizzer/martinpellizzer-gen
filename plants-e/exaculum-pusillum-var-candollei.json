    "intro": "Exaculum pusillum var. candollei, commonly known as the dwarf sand sedge, is a small perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
