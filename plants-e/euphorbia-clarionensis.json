    "intro": "Euphorbia clarionensis, commonly known as the Clarion spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small, paddle-shaped, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia clarionensis is also noted for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions."
