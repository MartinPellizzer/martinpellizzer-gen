    "intro": "Euphorbia humifusa f. pilosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. The plant features thick, waxy leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in yellowish to greenish cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
