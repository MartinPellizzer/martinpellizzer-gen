It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small blue to purple flowers during the summer months. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, narrow leaves compared to other varieties of Erigeron scaposus."
