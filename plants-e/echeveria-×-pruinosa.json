It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that often develop a bluish hue when exposed to full sun. The plant produces clusters of violet or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and striking color make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
