    "intro": "Echinolobium spinosissimum, commonly known as the spiny globe cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a globular shape, providing protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in dry environments. Echinolobium spinosissimum is well adapted to harsh climates and requires minimal water once established."
