    "intro": "Elaeocarpus poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and carving, though it is also threatened by habitat loss. The species plays an important ecological role in its native forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
