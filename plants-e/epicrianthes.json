    "intro": "Epicrianthes, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Ericaceae family. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. They are native to regions with cool, moist climates, often found in mountainous areas of South America. Epicrianthes species are adapted to acidic soils and can thrive in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Their ornamental value makes them popular in horticulture, though they require careful cultivation to flourish."
