    "intro": "Elaphoglossum grayumii, commonly known as the Gray's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. This plant is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Elaphoglossum grayumii has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
