    "intro": "Elymus glaucus var. virescens, commonly known as the green-blue wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
