    "intro": "Escobariopsis lasiacantha subsp. wohlschlageri, commonly known as the Wohlschlager's escobariopsis, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and finely divided, pinnate leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
