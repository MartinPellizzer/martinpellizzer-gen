    "intro": "Echinocereus ortegae subsp. ortegae, commonly known as the Ortega's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a short-lived perennial cactus characterized by its dense, spiny stems and vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration. The subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in succulent gardens."
