    "intro": "Echinopsis pseudominuscula, commonly known as the small-spined moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a covering of fine, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
