    "intro": "Eritrichium calycinum, commonly known as the Sierra glacierweed, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a small, herbaceous annual that produces delicate, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to the cold, alpine environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open slopes. Eritrichium calycinum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
