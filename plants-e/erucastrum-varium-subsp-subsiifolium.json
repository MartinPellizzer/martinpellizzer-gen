    "intro": "Erucastrum varium subsp. subsiifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed erucaceous, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and compact growth habit. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
