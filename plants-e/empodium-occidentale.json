    "intro": "Empodium occidentale, commonly known as western clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Empodium occidentale plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
