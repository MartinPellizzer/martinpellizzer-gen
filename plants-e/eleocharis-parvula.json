    "intro": "Eleocharis parvula, commonly known as the small spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are usually white or pale green, and are borne on short, erect branches. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often emerging from the base of the plant. Eleocharis parvula plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
