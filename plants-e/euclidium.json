    "intro": "Euclidium, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has a distinctive, hollow stem that is often used in floral arrangements. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture that distinguishes it from similar species. Euclidium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
