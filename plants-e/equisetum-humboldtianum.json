It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Equisetum humboldtianum is a primitive plant that has remained largely unchanged for millions of years."
