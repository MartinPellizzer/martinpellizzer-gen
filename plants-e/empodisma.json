    "intro": "Empodisma, commonly known as the swamp sedges, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as peat bogs and swampy areas, where they play a crucial role in soil formation. Empodisma species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are important in carbon sequestration and help maintain the structure of wetland ecosystems. Their rhizomes contribute to the formation of peat, making them ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
