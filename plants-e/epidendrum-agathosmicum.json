    "intro": "Epidendrum agathosmicum, commonly known as the Crimson Sword orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and green foliage and long, sword-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its striking appearance."
