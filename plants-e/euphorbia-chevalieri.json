    "intro": "Euphorbia chevalieri, commonly known as the Cretan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to dry environments and stores water in its leaves and stems. Euphorbia chevalieri is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
