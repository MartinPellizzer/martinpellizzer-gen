    "intro": "Euphorbia spinosa var. brachyadenia, commonly known as the short-stalked spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
