    "intro": "Eriogonum floridanum, commonly known as the Florida buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, small white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and pine flatwoods. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, three-lobed bracts that enclose its flowers. Eriogonum floridanum is an important plant for local pollinators and is considered a rare species due to habitat loss."
