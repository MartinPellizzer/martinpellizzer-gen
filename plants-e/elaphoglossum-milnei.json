    "intro": "Elaphoglossum milnei, commonly known as the Milne's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous in growth habit. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum milnei thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest understories where it benefits from high humidity and dappled sunlight."
