    "intro": "Eriogonum pendulum var. confertum, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
