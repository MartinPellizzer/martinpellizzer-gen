    "intro": "Erica paucifolia subsp. squarrosa, commonly known as the square-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
