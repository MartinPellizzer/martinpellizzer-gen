    "intro": "Erigeron rupestris, commonly known as rock blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Its leaves are generally gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erigeron rupestris produces small blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
