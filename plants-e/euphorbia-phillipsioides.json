    "intro": "Euphorbia phillipsioides, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments. Its milky sap contains latex, which can be irritating to the skin."
