    "intro": "Elaphoglossum eutecnum, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in forest understories. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum eutecnum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
