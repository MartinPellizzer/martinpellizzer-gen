    "intro": "Euclinia, commonly known as the African snowball, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their spherical clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Euclinia species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. They have simple, narrow leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits that are eaten by various birds and mammals. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
