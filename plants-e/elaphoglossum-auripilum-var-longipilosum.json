    "intro": "Elaphoglossum auripilum var. longipilosum, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a variant of the auripilum species within the Elaphoglossaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. This variant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
