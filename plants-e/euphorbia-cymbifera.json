    "intro": "Euphorbia cymbifera, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched, spiny stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia cymbifera is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
