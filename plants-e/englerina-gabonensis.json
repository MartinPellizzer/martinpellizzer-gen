    "intro": "Englerina gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Central Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
