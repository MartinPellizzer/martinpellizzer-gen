    "intro": "Elymus dasystachys, commonly known as the broad-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are adorned with long, slender bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Elymus dasystachys is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
