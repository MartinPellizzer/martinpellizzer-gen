    "intro": "Euphorbia tetrapora var. berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican milk bush, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces a milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
