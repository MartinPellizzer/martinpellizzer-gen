    "intro": "Epidendrum dolichorhachis, commonly known as the long-ridged epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Epidendrum dolichorhachis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
