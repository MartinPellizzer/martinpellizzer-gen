    "intro": "Euploca piurensis, commonly known as the Piura euploca, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in saline and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture. Euploca piurensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
