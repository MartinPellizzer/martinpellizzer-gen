    "intro": "Embolanthera, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the coastal regions of South America. These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically small, fleshy, and adapted to conserve water in arid or salty environments. Embolanthera species are often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Their unique adaptations make them an important part of coastal ecosystems."
