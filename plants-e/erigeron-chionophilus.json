    "intro": "Erigeron chionophilus, commonly known as the snow-loving fleabane, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its hairy leaves and stems help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erigeron chionophilus is often found in open slopes and meadows, where it contributes to the alpine flora diversity."
