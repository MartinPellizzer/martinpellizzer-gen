    "intro": "Eriosyce islayensis subsp. omasensis, commonly known as the Islay Omasa cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem that often develops a flattened, disc-like shape with age. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
