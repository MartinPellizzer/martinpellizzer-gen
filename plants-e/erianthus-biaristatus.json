    "intro": "Erianthus biaristatus, commonly known as the silverleaf bluestem, is a tall grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tall, slender inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for prairies and disturbed areas. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it useful for erosion control. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
