    "intro": "Eugenia musarum, commonly known as the purple-leafed eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark purple foliage that provides striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
