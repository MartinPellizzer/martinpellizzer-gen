    "intro": "Eucalyptus incrassata var. dumosa, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a variant of the eucalyptus species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a dull green upper surface with a whitish underside. This plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
