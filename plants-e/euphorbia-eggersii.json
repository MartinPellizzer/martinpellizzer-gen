    "intro": "Euphorbia eggersii, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making handling require caution. Euphorbia eggersii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
