It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and delicate growth habits, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
