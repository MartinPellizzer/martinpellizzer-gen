    "intro": "Elaphoglossum eximium, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum eximium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
