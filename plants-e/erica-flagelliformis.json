    "intro": "Erica flagelliformis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas with high wind exposure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erica flagelliformis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
