    "intro": "Euphorbia seguieriana var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette or spreading pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and unique foliage."
