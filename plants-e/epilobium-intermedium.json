    "intro": "Epilobium intermedium, commonly known as the common willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish and branched. Epilobium intermedium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but plays an important role in ecological succession and soil stabilization."
