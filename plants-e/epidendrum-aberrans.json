    "intro": "Epidendrum aberrans, commonly known as the variable epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum aberrans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
