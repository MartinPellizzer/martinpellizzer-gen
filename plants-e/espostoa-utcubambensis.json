    "intro": "Espostoa utcubambensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian candelabra cactus, is a unique species native to the Andes mountains of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, branching structure with numerous cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
