    "intro": "Epidendrum oxyglossum, commonly known as the silver-tipped epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces showy, pendulous inflorescences with flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum oxyglossum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
