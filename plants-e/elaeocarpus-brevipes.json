It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, purple fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
