    "intro": "Erica resinosa, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, resinous coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Erica resinosa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
