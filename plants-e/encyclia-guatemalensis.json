    "intro": "Encyclia guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan cycad, is a species of cycad native to Central America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some areas."
