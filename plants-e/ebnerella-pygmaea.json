    "intro": "Ebnerella pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has heart-shaped, floating leaves that are usually less than 5 centimeters in diameter. Its flowers are small, white, and bloom in the early morning, often closing by midday. Ebnerella pygmaea plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
