    "intro": "Epicampes gracilis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branched stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Epicampes gracilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
