    "intro": "Euphorbia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the summer months. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, which is a common feature among many species in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Euphorbia tenuifolia is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
