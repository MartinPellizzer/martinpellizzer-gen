    "intro": "Equisetum palustre f. ramosissimum, commonly known as the swamp horsehair fern, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. This fern is a primitive plant with a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
