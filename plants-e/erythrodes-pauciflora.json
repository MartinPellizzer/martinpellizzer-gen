It is a shrub characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically red or orange in color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
