    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. microstachyum, commonly known as the small-stalked field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail found in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in rough, silica-rich nodes. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in the uppermost parts. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its primitive structure and its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
