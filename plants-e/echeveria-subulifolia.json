    "intro": "Echeveria subulifolia, commonly known as the needle-leaf echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of narrow, pointed leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
