It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or woolly underside, contributing to its drought tolerance. The showy yellow to orange flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
