    "intro": "Eugenia beyeri, commonly known as the African snowball, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in winter. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The fruit, though not typically eaten by humans, is an important food source for local wildlife."
