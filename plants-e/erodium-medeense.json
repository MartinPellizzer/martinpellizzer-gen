    "intro": "Erodium medeense, commonly known as the Medeens' erodium, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it produces small, rounded pods that contain seeds. Erodium medeense is often found in disturbed areas and can be an indicator species for certain soil types."
