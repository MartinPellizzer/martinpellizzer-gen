    "intro": "Elaphoglossum angamarcanum, commonly known as the Angamarca holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves occurring on separate plants. The plant is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds. This fern prefers shaded, moist habitats and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas."
