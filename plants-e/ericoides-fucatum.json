It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime climates. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in late spring to early summer. Ericoides fucatum is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
