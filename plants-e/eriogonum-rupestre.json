    "intro": "Eriogonum rupestre, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum rupestre is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
