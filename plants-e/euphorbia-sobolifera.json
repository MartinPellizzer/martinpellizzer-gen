    "intro": "Euphorbia sobolifera, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces a milky latex sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia sobolifera is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall."
