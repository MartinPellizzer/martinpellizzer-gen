It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in wetland or marshy environments. It has a compact growth habit with rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively. The botanical features of Eriocaulon biappendiculatum make it an important species for ecological studies in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
