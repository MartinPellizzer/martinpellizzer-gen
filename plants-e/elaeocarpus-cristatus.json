    "intro": "Elaeocarpus cristatus, commonly known as the crested elaeocarpus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, crown-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically green when mature and turn red upon ripening. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth surface with a slightly waxy texture. Elaeocarpus cristatus is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
