    "intro": "Elaeagnus conferta var. conferta, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
