It is characterized by its silvery-hairy leaves and small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible for birds and some animals. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. It produces fragrant flowers in spring, which are important for pollinators. The wood of Elaeagnus oxycarpa is hard and has been traditionally used for making tools and furniture."
