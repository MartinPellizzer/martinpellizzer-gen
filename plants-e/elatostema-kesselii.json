    "intro": "Elatostema kesselii, commonly known as the velvetleaf elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of velvet-like hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Elatostema kesselii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
