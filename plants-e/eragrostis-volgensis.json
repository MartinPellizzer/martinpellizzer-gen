    "intro": "Eragrostis volgensis, commonly known as the Volga grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or loamy soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Eragrostis volgensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
