    "intro": "Eriophorum polystachion var. elegans, commonly known as the slender cotton grass, is a flowering plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced after the plant has developed tall, slender stems. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, such as those found in tundra and wet meadows. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants."
