    "intro": "Euphorbia mitchelliana var. typica, commonly known as Mitchell's spurge, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which is a common feature among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its foliage is typically green with a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss."
