    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum f. ramosum, commonly known as the branched horsetail, is a fern ally characterized by its distinctive, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is typically found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an aggressive colonizer in suitable habitats. The species is also notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
