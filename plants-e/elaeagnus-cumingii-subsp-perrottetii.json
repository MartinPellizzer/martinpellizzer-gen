    "intro": "Elaeagnus cumingii subsp. perrottetii, commonly known as the Chinese silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-hairy leaves and small, yellowish-green berries that ripen in autumn. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in poor soils. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it useful in reforestation and soil improvement. The subspecies is closely related to other members of the Elaeagnus genus, which are known for their adaptability to harsh environments."
