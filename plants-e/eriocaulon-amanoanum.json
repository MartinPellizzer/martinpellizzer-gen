It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly found in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
