    "intro": "Euthamnus, commonly known as goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange inflorescences. Euthamnus species typically have lance-shaped leaves and are often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. They are important sources of nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Many species are also used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value."
