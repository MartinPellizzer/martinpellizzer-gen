    "intro": "Epidendrum tabulare, commonly known as the flat-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, which bloom during the warmer months. Epidendrum tabulare is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive in cultivation."
