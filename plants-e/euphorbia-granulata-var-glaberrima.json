    "intro": "Euphorbia granulata var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually small, rounded, and covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
