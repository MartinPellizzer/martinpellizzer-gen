    "intro": "Echinocereus fasciculatus var. fasciculatus, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring dense clusters of spines and a ribbed stem. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and bats. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. This cactus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
