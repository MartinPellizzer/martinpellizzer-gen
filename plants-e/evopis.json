    "intro": "Evopis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. Evopis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it both a useful plant for certain ecological studies and a potential invasive species in some regions."
