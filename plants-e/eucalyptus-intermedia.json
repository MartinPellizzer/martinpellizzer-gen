    "intro": "Eucalyptus intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pink, which are typically clustered in groups of three. Its bark is typically smooth and greyish, often peeling in thin layers. Eucalyptus intermedia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climatic conditions."
