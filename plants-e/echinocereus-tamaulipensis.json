It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and its ability to store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it well-suited for desert environments. Its structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
