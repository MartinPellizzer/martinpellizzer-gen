    "intro": "Euphorbia simulans, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, woody stem that branches into multiple stems, often with a reddish or brownish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Euphorbia simulans is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
