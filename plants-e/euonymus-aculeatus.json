    "intro": "Euonymus aculeatus, commonly known as the Spineless woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, inflated fruits that split open to reveal seeds. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Euonymus aculeatus is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
