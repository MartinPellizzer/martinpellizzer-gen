    "intro": "Equisetum heleocharis f. brachycladon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water horsetail, is a variant of the water horsetail species. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its slender, jointed stems and reduced leaves. This plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones, which are typical of the horsetail genus. The narrow, almost leafless stems and its ability to colonize waterlogged soils make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
