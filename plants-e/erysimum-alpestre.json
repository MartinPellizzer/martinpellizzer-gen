    "intro": "Erysimum alpestre, commonly known as alpine wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Erysimum alpestre is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate cold and poor soil conditions."
