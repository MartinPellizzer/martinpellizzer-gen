    "intro": "Euphorbia salina, commonly known as the saltbush, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its ability to tolerate high levels of salt makes it an important plant in coastal and desert ecosystems. Euphorbia salina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in xerophytic gardens."
