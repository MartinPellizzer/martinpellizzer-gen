It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
