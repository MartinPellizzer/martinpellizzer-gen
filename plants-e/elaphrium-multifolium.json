    "intro": "Elaphrium multifolium, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense racemes. Elaphrium multifolium thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
