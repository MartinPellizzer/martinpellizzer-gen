It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of purple to pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and often have a slightly hairy underside.
