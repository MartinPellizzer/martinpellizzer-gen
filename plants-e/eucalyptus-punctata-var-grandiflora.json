    "intro": "Eucalyptus punctata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is adapted to a range of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species suitable for various environmental conditions. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping."
