    "intro": "Eugenia arctostaphyloides var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval-leaved evergreen cherry, is a compact shrub native to eastern Australia. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by edible, red, fleshy berries that attract birds. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils."
