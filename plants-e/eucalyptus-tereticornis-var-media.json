    "intro": "Eucalyptus tereticornis var. media, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mahogany gum, is a medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and peels off in thin, papery layers, and it is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. This variety is valued for its timber and has been introduced to other parts of the world for ornamental and industrial purposes."
