    "intro": "Elaphoglossum reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, glossy segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
