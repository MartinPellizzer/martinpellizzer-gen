    "intro": "Eleocharis wadoodii, commonly known as the Wadood's spike rush, is a species of sedge native to parts of Asia, including India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure typical of the Cyperaceae family. Eleocharis wadoodii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
