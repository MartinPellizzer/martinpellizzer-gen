    "intro": "Euphorbia adenochila, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are typically small and sometimes reduced, with a glandular surface that can exude a milky sap. Euphorbia adenochila is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, sandy soils."
