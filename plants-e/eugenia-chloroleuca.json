    "intro": "Eugenia chloroleuca, commonly known as the white-leaved eucalyptus, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, white- or pale-green bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are followed by woody, spherical capsules containing seeds. Eugenia chloroleuca is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
