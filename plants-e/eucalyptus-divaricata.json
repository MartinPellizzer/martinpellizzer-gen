    "intro": "Eucalyptus divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. Eucalyptus divaricata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and heat. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
