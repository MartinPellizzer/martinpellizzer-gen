    "intro": "Echinocactus ornatus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, branched pedicels. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
