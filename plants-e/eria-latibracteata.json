    "intro": "Eria latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract eria, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant produces elongated, fleshy bracts that are broader than the flowers themselves, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Eria latibracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique floral display."
