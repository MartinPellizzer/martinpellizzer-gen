    "intro": "Euphorbia memoralis, commonly known as the memorial euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often modified into spines. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are surrounded by a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. Euphorbia memoralis is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its stems and having a slow growth rate. It is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
