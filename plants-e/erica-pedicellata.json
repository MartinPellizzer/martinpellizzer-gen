    "intro": "Erica pedicellata, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Erica pedicellata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
