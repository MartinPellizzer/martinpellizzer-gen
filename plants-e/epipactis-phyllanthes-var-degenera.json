    "intro": "Epipactis phyllanthes var. degenera, commonly known as the Degener's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent lip structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
