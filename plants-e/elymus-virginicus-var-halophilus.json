    "intro": "Elymus virginicus var. halophilus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important stabilizer of coastal dunes and wetlands. Its botanical features make it a key component of salt marsh and tidal flat ecosystems."
