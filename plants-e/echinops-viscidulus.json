    "intro": "Echinops viscidulus, commonly known as the sticky globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. Echinops viscidulus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
