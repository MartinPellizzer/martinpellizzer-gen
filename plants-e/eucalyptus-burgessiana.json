    "intro": "Eucalyptus burgessiana, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that ranges from grey to brown in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climatic conditions."
