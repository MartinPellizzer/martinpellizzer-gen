    "intro": "Eriophyllum tenuifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Eriophyllum tenuifolium is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
