    "intro": "Ephielis vouarana, commonly known as the Vouarana orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying vibrant shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its humid, shaded environment. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss in the understory of the forest. Ephielis vouarana is also noted for its ornamental value and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its ecological significance and conservation status."
