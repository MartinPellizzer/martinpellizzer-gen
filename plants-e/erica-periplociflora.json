    "intro": "Erica periplociflora, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, compact form and needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica periplociflora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. It is an important component of fynbos vegetation and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
