    "intro": "Euphorbia kudrjaschevii, commonly known as the Siberian spurge, is a perennial plant native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and distinctive yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
