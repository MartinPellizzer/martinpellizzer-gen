    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine millipede fern, is a variant of the variable horsetail. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are typically green with a reddish hue. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are clustered in whorls. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its primitive structure reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
