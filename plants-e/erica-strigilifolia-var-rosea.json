    "intro": "Erica strigilifolia var. rosea, commonly known as the pink heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It features compact, wiry stems covered in dense, leathery foliage that is typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
