    "intro": "Elymus lanceolatus subsp. lanceolatus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species for erosion control."
