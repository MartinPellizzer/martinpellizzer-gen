    "intro": "Eria sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
