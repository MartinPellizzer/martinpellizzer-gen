    "intro": "Epilobium foliosum var. glabrum, commonly known as smooth willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and disturbed sites. Epilobium foliosum var. glabrum is an important plant in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
