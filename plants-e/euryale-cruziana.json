    "intro": "Euryale cruziana, commonly known as the water caltrop, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating, spiky fruit that resembles a small, round shield. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The fruit contains several seeds, which are encased in a hard, bony shell."
