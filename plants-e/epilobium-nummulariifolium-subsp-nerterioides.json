It is characterized by its small, round leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
