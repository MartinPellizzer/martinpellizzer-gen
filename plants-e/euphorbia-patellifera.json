    "intro": "Euphorbia patellifera, commonly known as the flat-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
