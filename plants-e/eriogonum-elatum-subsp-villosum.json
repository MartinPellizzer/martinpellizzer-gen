    "intro": "Eriogonum elatum subsp. villosum, commonly known as the hairy leaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
