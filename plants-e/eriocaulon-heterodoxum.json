    "intro": "Eriocaulon heterodoxum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a member of the Poales order and the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in consistently moist to water-saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct midrib, while the flowers are small and clustered in spike-like structures. Eriocaulon heterodoxum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
