    "intro": "Epidendrum meridense, commonly known as the Mexican flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Epidendrum meridense thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
