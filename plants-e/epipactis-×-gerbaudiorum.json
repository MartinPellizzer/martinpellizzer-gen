    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 gerbaudiorum, commonly known as the Gerbaud's helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine. It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its native habitat. Due to its hybrid origin, it is often found in areas where the parent species overlap geographically."
