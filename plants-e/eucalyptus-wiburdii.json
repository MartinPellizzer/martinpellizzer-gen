    "intro": "Eucalyptus wiburdii, commonly known as the Wiburd's gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that ranges from white to grey in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in groups of three. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Eucalyptus wiburdii is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
