    "intro": "Euphorbia knuthii subsp. knuthii, commonly known as Knuth's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its dry environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its resilience and distinctive appearance."
