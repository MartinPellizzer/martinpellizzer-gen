    "intro": "Echinomeria, commonly known as the \"Mexican honeycomb,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiky, spherical flower heads that resemble a honeycomb, which is a key botanical feature. Echinomeria species typically belong to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and are known for their showy, brightly colored blooms. They often grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to dry conditions with their succulent leaves and compact growth form. The genus includes several species, such as Echinomeria baileyi and Echinomeria grayii, which are popular in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
