    "intro": "Erysimum caespitosum, commonly known as the rock cress or prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early spring. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Erysimum caespitosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
