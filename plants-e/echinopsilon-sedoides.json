    "intro": "Echinopsilon sedoides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Echinopsilon sedoides is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall."
