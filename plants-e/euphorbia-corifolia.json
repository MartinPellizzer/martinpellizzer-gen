    "intro": "Euphorbia corifolia, commonly known as the coral tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, coral-like inflorescences that appear in clusters of red or orange cyathia. The plant has smooth, often grey-green leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia corifolia is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap that can cause skin irritation."
