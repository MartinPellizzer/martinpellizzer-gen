    "intro": "Epidendrum batesii, commonly known as the Pink Lady's Slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper or a lady's shoe, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Epidendrum batesii thrives in warm, moist conditions with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
