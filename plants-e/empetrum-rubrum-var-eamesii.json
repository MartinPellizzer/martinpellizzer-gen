    "intro": "Empetrum rubrum var. eamesii, commonly known as the Eames' red crowbar, is a variant of the red crowbar plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
