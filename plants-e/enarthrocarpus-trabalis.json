    "intro": "Enarthrocarpus trabalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hard, dense wood and lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its strong wood and ecological importance, it is sometimes harvested for timber, though it is also valued for its role in local ecosystems."
