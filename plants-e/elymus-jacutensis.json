    "intro": "Elymus jacutensis, commonly known as the Central Asian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along riverbanks. Elymus jacutensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
