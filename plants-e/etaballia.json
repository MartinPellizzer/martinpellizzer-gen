    "intro": "Etaballia, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a unique species native to certain tropical regions. It features striking, butterfly-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green and white. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage is known for its waxy texture and ability to retain moisture, making it somewhat drought-tolerant. Etaballia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
