    "intro": "Euphorbia conformis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cup-shaped structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Euphorbia conformis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
