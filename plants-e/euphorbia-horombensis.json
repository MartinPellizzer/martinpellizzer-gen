    "intro": "Euphorbia horombensis, commonly known as the Horomb\u00e9 euphorbia, is a spiny, succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-like structures containing yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions with its water-storing tissues. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
