It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variant is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance and ecological niche."
