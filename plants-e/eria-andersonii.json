It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in cool, humid environments. Its blooming period occurs during the spring, producing clusters of white or pale pink blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria andersonii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
