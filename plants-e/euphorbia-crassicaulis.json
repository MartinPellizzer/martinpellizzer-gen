    "intro": "Euphorbia crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
