    "intro": "Euphorbia salicifolia var. incana, commonly known as the woollyleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It features distinctive, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its toxic sap and invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
