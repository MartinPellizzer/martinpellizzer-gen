    "intro": "Eugenia brevifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved eugenia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
