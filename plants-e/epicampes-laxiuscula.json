    "intro": "Epicampes laxiuscula, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, featuring slender, erect stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems."
