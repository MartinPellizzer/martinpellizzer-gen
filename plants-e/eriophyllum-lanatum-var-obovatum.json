It features dense, woolly silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast to its bright yellow flower heads. The plant produces small, composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
