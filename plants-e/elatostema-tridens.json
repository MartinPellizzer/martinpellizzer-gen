    "intro": "Elatostema tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, commonly known as the nettle family, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stinging hairs, a common trait among members of the Urticaceae family. Elatostema tridens produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
