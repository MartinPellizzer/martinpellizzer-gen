    "intro": "Espeletia occulta subsp. glossophylla, commonly known as the \"Cock's-comb\" or \"Cock's-hat,\" is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces tall, spires of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments with strong sunlight and cool temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and botanical collections."
