    "intro": "Eugenia cayoana, commonly known as the Cayoana guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and Hispaniola. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellowish-orange fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. Its fruits are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities as well."
