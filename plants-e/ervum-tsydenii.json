    "intro": "Ervum tsydenii, commonly known as the Tsydenii vetch, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the vetch genus."
