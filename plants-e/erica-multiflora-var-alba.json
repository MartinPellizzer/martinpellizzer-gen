    "intro": "Erica multiflora var. alba, commonly known as the white heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes."
