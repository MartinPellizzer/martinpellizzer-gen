    "intro": "Exodiclis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish-white flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy habitats, contributing to its ecological importance. Exodiclis angustifolia is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
