    "intro": "Euphorbia striatella var. persepolitana, commonly known as the Persian spurge, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to dry, rocky environments. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
