    "intro": "Eriocaulon trinianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming spikelets that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Eriocaulon trinianum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
