    "intro": "Eragrostis stolonifera, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form a dense turf. Buffalo grass is often used in drought-tolerant landscaping due to its minimal water requirements."
