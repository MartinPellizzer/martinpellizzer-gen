    "intro": "Eria merrillii, commonly known as the Hainan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Eria merrillii is considered a vulnerable species."
