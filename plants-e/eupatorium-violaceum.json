    "intro": "Eupatorium violaceum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking clusters of pale blue to purple flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, white flowers that are arranged in dense panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Eupatorium violaceum is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
