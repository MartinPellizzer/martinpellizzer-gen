    "intro": "Epigynium dunalianum, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the end of its stems, which are borne on short pedicels. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a common defense mechanism in many members of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant's unique appearance and adaptation to drought make it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
