    "intro": "Eupatorium tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's boneset, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Tracy's boneset is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine, though its medicinal applications are not well-documented in modern scientific literature."
