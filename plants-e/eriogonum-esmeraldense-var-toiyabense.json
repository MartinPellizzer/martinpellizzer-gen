    "intro": "Eriogonum esmeraldense var. toiyabense, commonly known as the Toiyabene sand verbena, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is part of the large and diverse genus Eriogonum, which includes many species adapted to a wide range of ecological conditions."
