    "intro": "Epidendrum aeolicum, commonly known as the Aeolic Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytic on trees or rocks. Its leaves are elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum aeolicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
