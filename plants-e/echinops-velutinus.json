    "intro": "Echinops velutinus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, spiky fruit. Echinops velutinus is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access underground water. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
