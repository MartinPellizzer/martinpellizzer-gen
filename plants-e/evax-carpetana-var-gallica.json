    "intro": "Evax carpetana var. gallica, commonly known as the Galician carpet or Galician saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Galicia in Spain. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to withstand strong sea winds and salt spray. The plant features dense, mat-like foliage with small, fleshy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal soils."
