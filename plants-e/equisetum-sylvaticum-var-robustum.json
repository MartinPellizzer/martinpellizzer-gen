    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum var. robustum, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are covered in rough, tooth-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
