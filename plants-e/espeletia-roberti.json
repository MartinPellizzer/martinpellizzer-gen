    "intro": "Espeletia roberti, commonly known as the Robles rosette, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of silver-green, woolly leaves that form a tight, rounded structure. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear small, white or pinkish flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude, arid environment. Espeletia roberti is a member of the Asteraceae family and is well adapted to the extreme conditions of its native habitat."
