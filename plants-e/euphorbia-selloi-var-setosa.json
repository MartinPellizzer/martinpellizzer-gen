    "intro": "Euphorbia selloi var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
