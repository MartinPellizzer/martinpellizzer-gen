    "intro": "Eriogonum pulvinatum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to California and Nevada. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and tall, branched stalks that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun exposure. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid landscapes. Eriogonum pulvinatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and grassland ecosystems."
