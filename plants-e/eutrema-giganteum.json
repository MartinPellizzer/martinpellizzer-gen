    "intro": "Eutrema giganteum, commonly known as the giant seaside aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Eutrema giganteum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators."
