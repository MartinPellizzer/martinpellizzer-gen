    "intro": "Elymus curvifolius, commonly known as bentgrass or curlyleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often curved leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Elymus curvifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
