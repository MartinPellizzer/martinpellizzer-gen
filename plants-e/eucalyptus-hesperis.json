    "intro": "Eucalyptus hesperis, commonly known as the mallee box, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its aromatic oils, found in the leaves, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Eucalyptus hesperis is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands."
