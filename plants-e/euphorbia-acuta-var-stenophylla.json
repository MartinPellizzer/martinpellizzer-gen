    "intro": "Euphorbia acuta var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
