    "intro": "Epacris lithophila, commonly known as the rock epacris, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a member of the heath family (Ericaceae) and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops and in open heathlands. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which attract nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to the harsh conditions of its rocky habitat. Epacris lithophila is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
