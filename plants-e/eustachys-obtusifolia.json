    "intro": "Eustachys obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, including marshes and swampy soils, and thrives in humid, moist environments. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of bract-like leaves that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. Eustachys obtusifolia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
