It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Eryngium crantzioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
