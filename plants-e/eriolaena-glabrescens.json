    "intro": "Eriolaena glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth eriolaena, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded understorey environments. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
