    "intro": "Euphorbia buhsei var. lasiostemon, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a thick, branching stem with spiny, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true flowers. Its leaves and stems contain a milky sap that can be irritant. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water."
