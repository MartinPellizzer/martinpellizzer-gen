    "intro": "Ephedra major var. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden ephedra, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the alkaloid ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in harsh, dry environments and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
