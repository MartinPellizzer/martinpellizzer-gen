    "intro": "Euroschinus rubromarginatus, commonly known as the red-marginated euphorbia, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its stout, woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a distinctive red or orange margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and rocky conditions of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
