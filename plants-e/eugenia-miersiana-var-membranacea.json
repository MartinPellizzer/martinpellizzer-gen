    "intro": "Eugenia miersiana var. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, membranous layer. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
