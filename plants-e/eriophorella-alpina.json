    "intro": "Eriophorella alpina, commonly known as the alpine eriophorella, is a small, perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a slender, creeping stem with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny, greenish-yellow blooms that appear in early summer. Due to its specialized habitat, Eriophorella alpina is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystem health."
