    "intro": "Eugenia pinnata, commonly known as the red-leaved guava, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often a deep red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pinkish-red fruits similar to guavas. Eugenia pinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
