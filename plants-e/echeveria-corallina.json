It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
