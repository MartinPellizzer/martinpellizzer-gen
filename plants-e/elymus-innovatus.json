    "intro": "Elymus innovatus, commonly known as the innovative wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and culms that are often densely hairy. The plant produces spikelets that are typically two-ranked, with lemmas that are usually shorter than the palea. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green color, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Elymus innovatus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
