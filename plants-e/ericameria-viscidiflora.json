    "intro": "Ericameria viscidiflora, commonly known as stickyleaf goldenbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Ericameria viscidiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
