    "intro": "Euphorbia dentata var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often reduced to small, toothed scales, and it is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. This species is valued for its unique appearance and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
