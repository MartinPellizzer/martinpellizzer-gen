    "intro": "Euphorbia anomala, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It features a short, thick stem with numerous branching spines, and its leaves are small, fleshy, and often reduced to scales. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its stems and leaves. Euphorbia anomala is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
