It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
