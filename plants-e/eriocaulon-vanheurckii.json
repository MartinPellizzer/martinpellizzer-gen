    "intro": "Eriocaulon vanheurckii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh plant, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
