    "intro": "Eucalyptus saligna subsp. botryoides, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas."
