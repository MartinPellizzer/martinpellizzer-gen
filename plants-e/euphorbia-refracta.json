    "intro": "Euphorbia refracta, commonly known as the brittle-stemmed spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Euphorbia refracta is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
