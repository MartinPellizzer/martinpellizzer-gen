    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 phylacis, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus phylacris. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, often displaying a mix of grey and brown tones. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a dull green upper surface with a white or grey underside. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is native to southeastern Australia and is valued for its timber and medicinal properties."
