    "intro": "Exochaenium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Exochaenium rotundifolium plays a role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
