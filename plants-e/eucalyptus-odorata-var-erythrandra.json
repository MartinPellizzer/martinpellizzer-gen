    "intro": "Eucalyptus odorata var. erythrandra, commonly known as the red-leafed ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown color underneath. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, turning red or orange during the dry season. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
