    "intro": "Ephedra kaschgarica, commonly known as the Karakoram ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Ephedra kaschgarica contains the alkaloid ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in degraded landscapes."
