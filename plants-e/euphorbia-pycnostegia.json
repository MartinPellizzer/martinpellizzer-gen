    "intro": "Euphorbia pycnostegia, commonly known as the dense-stemmed spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
