    "intro": "Euphorbia affinis, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick, and somewhat woody stem with smooth, greenish-gray leaves that are usually covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and green, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia affinis is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, which helps it survive in dry conditions."
