    "intro": "Elymus gangotrianus, commonly known as the Tibetan wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and Nepal. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Elymus gangotrianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
