    "intro": "Erica fugax, commonly known as the transient heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a drought-resistant structure. Erica fugax plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect and bird populations."
