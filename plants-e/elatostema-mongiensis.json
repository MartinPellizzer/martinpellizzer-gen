    "intro": "Elatostema mongiensis, commonly known as the Mongolian elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive reddish or purplish underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the spring. Elatostema mongiensis is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which helps it compete effectively in its native habitat."
