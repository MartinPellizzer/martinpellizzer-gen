    "intro": "Erigeron pseudoneglectus, commonly known as the narrowleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing yellow centers surrounded by white ray florets."
