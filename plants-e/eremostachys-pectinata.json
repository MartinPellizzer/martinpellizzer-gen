    "intro": "Eremostachys pectinata, commonly known as the woolly antelope bush, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the rainy season. Its compact growth habit and ability to store water in its fleshy leaves make it well adapted to drought conditions. Eremostachys pectinata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
