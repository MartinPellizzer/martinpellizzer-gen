    "intro": "Eupatorium anomalum, commonly known as the swamp boneset, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy or loamy soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers during the summer months. Its flowering stems are usually tall and slender, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Eupatorium anomalum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
