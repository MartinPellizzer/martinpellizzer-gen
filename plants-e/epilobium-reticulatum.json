    "intro": "Epilobium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. Its flowers are small, pink or purple, and clustered in dense spikes, making it a notable presence in early summer gardens and natural habitats. Epilobium reticulatum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
