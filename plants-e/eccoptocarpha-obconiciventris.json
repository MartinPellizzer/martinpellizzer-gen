    "intro": "Eccoptocarpha obconiciventris, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry grasslands. Due to its ability to store water in its leaves, it is well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
