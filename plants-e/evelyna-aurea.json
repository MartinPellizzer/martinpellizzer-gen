It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are tubular in shape and are often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.
