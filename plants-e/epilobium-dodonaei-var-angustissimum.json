    "intro": "Epilobium dodonaei var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, angular stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
