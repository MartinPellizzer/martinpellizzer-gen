    "intro": "Evolvulus alopecuroides, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the morning. Native to Central America, it thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed."
