    "intro": "Euphorbia belgradica, commonly known as the Belgrade spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and may have a waxy texture. Euphorbia belgradica is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
