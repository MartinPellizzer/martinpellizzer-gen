    "intro": "Epidendrum myrmecophorum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, providing them with shelter in specialized structures called domatia. The plant's leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. It produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
