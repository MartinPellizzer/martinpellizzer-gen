    "intro": "Eugenia ovatifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Eugenia ovatifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
