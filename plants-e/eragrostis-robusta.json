It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish to brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Eragrostis robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
