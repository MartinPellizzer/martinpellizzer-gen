    "intro": "Euphorbia decussata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia decussata is also noted for its ability to store water in its leaves, a characteristic typical of many succulent species."
