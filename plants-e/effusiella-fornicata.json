    "intro": "Effusiella fornicata, commonly known as the coral-like liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, branching growth pattern and bright green, overlapping leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are usually found at the tips of the branches. Effusiella fornicata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
