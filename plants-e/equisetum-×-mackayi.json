    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 mackayi, commonly known as the Mackay's horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, sandy soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant features whorled leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures, with a central stem that is jointed and covered in a layer of silica. Its reproductive structures include fertile and sterile stems, with the fertile stems bearing spore-producing cones at their tips. This species is notable for its primitive morphology, reflecting its ancient lineage within the Equisetaceae family."
