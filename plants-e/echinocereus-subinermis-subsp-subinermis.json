    "intro": "Echinocereus subinermis subsp. subinermis, commonly known as the Apache diamondback cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that are often shorter than the ribs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions."
