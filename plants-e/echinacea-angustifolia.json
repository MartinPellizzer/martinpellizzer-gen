It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking purple to pinkish-red flower heads with a prominent central cone. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Echinacea angustifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its immune-boosting compounds."
