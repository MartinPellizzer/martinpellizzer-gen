    "intro": "Elytrigia repens subsp. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-awned meadow grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces spikelets that bear long, feathery awns. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
