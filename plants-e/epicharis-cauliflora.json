    "intro": "Epicharis cauliflora, commonly known as the red velvet candleplant, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its unique red, waxy flowers that resemble candles, which are borne along the stems rather than at the ends of branches, a feature known as cauliflory. Its leaves are broad, glossy, and often have a dark green to reddish hue. Epicharis cauliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
