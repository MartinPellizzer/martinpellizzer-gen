    "intro": "Euphorbia indica, commonly known as the greater spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm, featuring upright, branching stems covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in structures called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a potential weed in agricultural settings. Euphorbia indica is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
