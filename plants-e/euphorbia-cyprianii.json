    "intro": "Euphorbia cyprianii, commonly known as the Cyprian's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling should be done with care."
