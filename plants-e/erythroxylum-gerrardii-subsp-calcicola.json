    "intro": "Erythroxylum gerrardii subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone copal tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by ellipsoid capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to drought conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
