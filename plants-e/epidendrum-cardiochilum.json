    "intro": "Epidendrum cardiochilum, commonly known as the heart-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting red or purple lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum cardiochilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
