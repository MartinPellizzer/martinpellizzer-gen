It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are slightly curled under at the edges. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
