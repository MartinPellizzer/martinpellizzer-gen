    "intro": "Epidendrum calanthum var. revertianum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a lady's slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base of each bloom. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
