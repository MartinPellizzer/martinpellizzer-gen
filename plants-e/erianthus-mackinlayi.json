    "intro": "Erianthus mackinlayi, commonly known as Mackinlay's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, bluish-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Erianthus mackinlayi plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and soil stability."
