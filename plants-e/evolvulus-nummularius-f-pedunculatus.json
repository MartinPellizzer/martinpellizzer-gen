    "intro": "Evolvulus nummularius f. pedunculatus, commonly known as the trailing blue morning glory, is a compact, trailing perennial native to South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green, and it produces delicate, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and container gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom continuously throughout the growing season."
