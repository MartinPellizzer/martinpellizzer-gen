It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features compound leaves with three leaflets, which are typically glossy and dark green. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, and its ornamental value lies in its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in woodland gardens."
