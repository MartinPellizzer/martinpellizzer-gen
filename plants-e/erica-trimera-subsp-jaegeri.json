    "intro": "Erica trimera subsp. jaegeri, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions."
