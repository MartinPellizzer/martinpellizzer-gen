    "intro": "Echinus maximiliani, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by bright red berries that attract various bird species. Echinus maximiliani thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas at higher elevations. Its hardy nature and ornamental features make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
