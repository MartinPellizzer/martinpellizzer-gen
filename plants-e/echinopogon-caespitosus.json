    "intro": "Echinopogon caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a small, perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Echinopogon caespitosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in marginal environments."
