    "intro": "Ericoides capax, commonly known as the broad-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acidophilous plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant features dense, leathery foliage with elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and they bloom in late spring or early summer. Ericoides capax is well-suited to shady, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and high-altitude habitats."
