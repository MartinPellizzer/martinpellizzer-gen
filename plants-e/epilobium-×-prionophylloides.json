    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 prionophylloides, commonly known as the hybrid willow herb, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Epilobium palustre and Epilobium prionophyllum, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
