    "intro": "Euphorbia cartaginiensis, commonly known as the Cartagena spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Colombia. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution. Euphorbia cartaginiensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
