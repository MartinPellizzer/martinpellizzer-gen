    "intro": "Eupatorium alternifolium f. densifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved thoroughwort, is a variant of the common thoroughwort, characterized by its dense, compact foliage. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, woodland habitats. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, aromatic scent. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. This form is notable for its increased leaf density compared to the typical species, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in gardens and natural areas."
