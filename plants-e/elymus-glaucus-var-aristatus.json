    "intro": "Elymus glaucus var. aristatus, commonly known as the bluegrass or bluejoint grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with the upper lemma bearing a distinct, elongated awn. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems."
