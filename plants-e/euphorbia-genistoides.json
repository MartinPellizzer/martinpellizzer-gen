    "intro": "Euphorbia genistoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical structures called cyathia. The plant has woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Euphorbia genistoides is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
