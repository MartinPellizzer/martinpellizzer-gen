    "intro": "Epilobium subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf willow or slender willow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats. Its stems are often reddish-brown and slightly woody, while its leaves are covered in fine hairs. Epilobium subulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
