    "intro": "Euphorbia arida subsp. camdebooensis, commonly known as the Camdeboo euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in dry climates."
