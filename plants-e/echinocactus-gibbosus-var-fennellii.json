    "intro": "Echinocactus gibbosus var. fennellii, commonly known as the Fennell's barrel cactus, is a slow-growing, columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height, with a distinctive swollen base. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
