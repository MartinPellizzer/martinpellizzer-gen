    "intro": "Epidendrum zingiberaceum, commonly known as the ginger orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. Its inflorescence is a raceme, and the flowers are often clustered in dense spikes. Epidendrum zingiberaceum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
