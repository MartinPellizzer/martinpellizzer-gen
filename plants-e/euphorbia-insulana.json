    "intro": "Euphorbia insulana, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, tree-like structure with a thick, branching stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its arid environment. Euphorbia insulana is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation in isolated ecosystems."
