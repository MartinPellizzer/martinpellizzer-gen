    "intro": "Eriocaulon vasudevanii, commonly known as the Vasudevanii spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern India. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense mats that help stabilize the substrate. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in spike-like structures, and it plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
