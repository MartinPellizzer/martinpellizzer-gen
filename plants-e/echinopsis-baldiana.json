    "intro": "Echinopsis baldiana, commonly known as the Bolivian moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem and spiny, globular shape. The plant produces striking white or yellow flowers during the night, which is a unique adaptation for pollination by nocturnal insects. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
