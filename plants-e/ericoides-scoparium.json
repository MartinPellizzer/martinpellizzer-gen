    "intro": "Ericoides scoparium, commonly known as the coastal shrub, is a hardy plant native to coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Ericoides scoparium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
