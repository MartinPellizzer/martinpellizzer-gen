It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces spiny, green spines and is well adapted to arid environments. It blooms with vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the dry season. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, making it highly drought-resistant."
