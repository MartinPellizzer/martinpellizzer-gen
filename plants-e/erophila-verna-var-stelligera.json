It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats along the ground. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
