    "intro": "Epidendrum alpicoloscandens, commonly known as the alpine epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white to yellow in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
