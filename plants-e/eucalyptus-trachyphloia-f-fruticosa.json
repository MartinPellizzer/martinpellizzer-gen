    "intro": "Eucalyptus trachyphloia f. fruticosa, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a variant of the smooth-barked gum species. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit, which distinguishes it from its parent species. The plant typically features rough, fissured bark that peels in longitudinal strips, providing a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a rough texture. This form is adapted to grow in cooler, wetter environments, often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
