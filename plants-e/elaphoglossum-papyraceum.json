    "intro": "Elaphoglossum papyraceum, commonly known as the paper fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often covered in a thin, papery layer, which contributes to its common name. Elaphoglossum papyraceum is found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
