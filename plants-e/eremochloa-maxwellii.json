    "intro": "Eremochloa maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to arid conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
