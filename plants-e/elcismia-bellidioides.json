    "intro": "Elcismia bellidioides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in xeric environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Elcismia bellidioides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
