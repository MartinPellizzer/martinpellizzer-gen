    "intro": "Echinopsis leucantha, commonly known as the White Hedge Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Echinopsis leucantha is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
