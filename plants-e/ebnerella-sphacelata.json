    "intro": "Ebnerella sphacelata, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features slender, erect stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Ebnerella sphacelata is an important species for wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
