    "intro": "Elatostema reticulatum var. grande, commonly known as the large nettleleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, typical of the Urticaceae family. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to the plant's modest appearance. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. This variant is distinguished by its larger leaf size compared to the typical form of Elatostema reticulatum."
