    "intro": "Eriogonum allenii, commonly known as Allen's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Allen's buckwheat plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food for pollinators and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
