    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender helleborine, is a perennial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive, lip-like structure. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It produces a greenish-yellow flower with a darkened throat, and its pollination is facilitated by specific insect species. The orchid exhibits a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake from the soil."
