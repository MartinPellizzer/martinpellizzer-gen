    "intro": "Epidendrum subaequale, commonly known as the equal-leaf orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. The plant features linear, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that enhances its ornamental appeal. Epidendrum subaequale thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
