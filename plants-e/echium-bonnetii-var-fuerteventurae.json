    "intro": "Echium bonnetii var. fuerteventurae, commonly known as the Fuerteventura thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and spiny, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
