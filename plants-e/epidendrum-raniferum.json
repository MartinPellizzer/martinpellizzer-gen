    "intro": "Epidendrum raniferum, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like flower spikes that can reach up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces numerous small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum raniferum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
