    "intro": "Euonymus macropterus var. miniatus, commonly known as the dwarf burning bush, is a compact shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its slow growth rate and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
