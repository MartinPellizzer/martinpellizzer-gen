    "intro": "Elymus glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Elymus glaberrimus is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
