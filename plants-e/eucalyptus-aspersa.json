    "intro": "Eucalyptus aspersa, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. This plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which attract various pollinators. It is typically found in dry, open forests and woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
