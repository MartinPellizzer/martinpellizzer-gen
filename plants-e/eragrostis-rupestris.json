    "intro": "Eragrostis rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in rocky or sandy soils. Eragrostis rupestris is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance environments."
