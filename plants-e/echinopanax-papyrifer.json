    "intro": "Echinopanax papyrifer, commonly known as the paper-leaf arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, papery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its growth habit is typically vine-like, with stems that can climb or trail along the ground. Echinopanax papyrifer is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
