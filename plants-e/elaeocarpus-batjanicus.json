    "intro": "Elaeocarpus batjanicus, commonly known as the Philippine elaeocarp, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
