    "intro": "Espeletia tunjana, commonly known as the Tunguian heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its high-altitude, arid environment. It is adapted to cold temperatures and strong sunlight, typical of its mountainous habitat. Espeletia tunjana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals."
