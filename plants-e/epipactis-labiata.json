    "intro": "Epipactis labiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in its woodland habitat. Epipactis labiata is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
