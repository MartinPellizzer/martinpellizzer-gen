    "intro": "Euphlebium orbilobulatum, commonly known as the orbilobular euphlebium, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the family Euphlebiaceae. It is characterized by its unique orbicular (rounded) leaves that are often lobed, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
