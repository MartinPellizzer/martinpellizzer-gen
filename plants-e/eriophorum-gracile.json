    "intro": "Eriophorum gracile, commonly known as the slender cotton grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the tips of its slender stems. This plant typically thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. Its narrow leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Eriophorum gracile plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
