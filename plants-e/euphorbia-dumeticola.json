    "intro": "Euphorbia dumeticola, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, ribbed leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia dumeticola is well adapted to harsh desert environments, thriving in full sun and low water conditions."
