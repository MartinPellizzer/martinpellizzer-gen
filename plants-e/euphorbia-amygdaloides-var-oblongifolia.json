    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features succulent, oblong leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
