    "intro": "Eriocaulon disepalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikerush, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Eriocaulon disepalum typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
