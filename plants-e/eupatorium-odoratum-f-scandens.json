    "intro": "Eupatorium odoratum f. scandens, commonly known as fragrant eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes. The plant features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often branching near the top. Its foliage consists of opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are small and clustered in panicles, producing a sweet, aromatic scent that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
