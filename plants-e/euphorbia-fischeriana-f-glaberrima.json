It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a smooth, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. This cultivar is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements in xeriscaping."
