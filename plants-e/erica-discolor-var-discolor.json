    "intro": "Erica discolor var. discolor, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica discolor var. discolor is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
