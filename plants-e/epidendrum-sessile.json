    "intro": "Epidendrum sessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, yellow, or pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate to high humidity for optimal growth. Epidendrum sessile is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
