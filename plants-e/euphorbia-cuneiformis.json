    "intro": "Euphorbia cuneiformis, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching structure with spiny, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested or contacted with skin. Euphorbia cuneiformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
