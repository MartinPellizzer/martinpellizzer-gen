    "intro": "Elephantusia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant elephant tree, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its massive, thick, and often gnarled trunk, which can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually oval in shape, with a waxy coating. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ornamental value."
