    "intro": "Echium pavonianum, commonly known as the Pavonian bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and silvery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Echium pavonianum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
