    "intro": "Elymus nodosus subsp. corsicus, commonly known as Corsican nodding grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive nodding inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of florets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
