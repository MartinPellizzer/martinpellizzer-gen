    "intro": "Eucalyptus ficifolia var. guilfoylei, commonly known as the coastal gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, yellow, and green. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. It produces small, creamy-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This variety is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
