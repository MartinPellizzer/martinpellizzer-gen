It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and rolled at the edges, giving the plant its specific epithet \"revolutum.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a common species in native plant gardens."
