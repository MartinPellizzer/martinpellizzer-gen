    "intro": "Euphorbia apatzingana, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling when cultivated."
