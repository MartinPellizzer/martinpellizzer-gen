    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile f. uliginosum, commonly known as the swamp scouringrush, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, spore-bearing cones and its lack of true leaves. This plant thrives in wet, acidic soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. It is a primitive vascular plant that has remained relatively unchanged since the Paleozoic era. The species is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
