    "intro": "Eucalyptus tereticornis var. squamosa, commonly known as the rough-barked eucalypt, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a rough texture. This variety produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has some medicinal applications due to its essential oils."
