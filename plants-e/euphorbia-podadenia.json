    "intro": "Euphorbia podadenia, commonly known as the candle bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a unique appearance. Euphorbia podadenia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
