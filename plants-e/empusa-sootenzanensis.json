    "intro": "Empusa sootenzanensis, commonly known as the Sootenzenan Ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of Sootenzena. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that emit a subtle, sweet aroma, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is highly specialized, capable of absorbing moisture from the humid air rather than soil. Due to its unique adaptations and limited habitat, Empusa sootenzanensis is considered a critically endangered species."
