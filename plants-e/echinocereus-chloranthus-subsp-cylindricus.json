    "intro": "Echinocereus chloranthus subsp. cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
