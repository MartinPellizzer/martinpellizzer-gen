    "intro": "Epidendrum pastoense, commonly known as the Pasto orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in dense clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum pastoense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
