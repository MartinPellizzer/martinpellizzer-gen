    "intro": "Eleocharis simulans, commonly known as the false spikerush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Eleocharis simulans plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
