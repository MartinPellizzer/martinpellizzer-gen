The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that turn red in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Elaeagnus longipes is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it useful in reforestation and soil improvement projects."
