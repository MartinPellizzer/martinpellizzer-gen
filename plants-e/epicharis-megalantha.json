    "intro": "Epicharis megalantha, commonly known as the giant epicharis, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest bromeliads. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, often accumulating water in their central cavity. Epicharis megalantha thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests."
