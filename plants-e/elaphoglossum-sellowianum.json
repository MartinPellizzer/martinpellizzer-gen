    "intro": "Elaphoglossum sellowianum, commonly known as the Sellow's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum sellowianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
