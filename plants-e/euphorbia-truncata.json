    "intro": "Euphorbia truncata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems. The latex it exudes is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
