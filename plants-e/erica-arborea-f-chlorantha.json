    "intro": "Erica arborea f. chlorantha, commonly known as the greenleaf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness. The varietal form 'chlorantha' distinguishes it by its notably greener leaves compared to the typical form of Erica arborea."
