    "intro": "Equisetum palustre f. luxurians, commonly known as the swamp horsetail, is a fern-like plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is often found in wetland environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in the spring. Its stems are hollow and segmented, with a distinctive ribbed structure. This variety is notable for its dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils."
