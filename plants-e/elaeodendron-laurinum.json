It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in the early spring. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees."
