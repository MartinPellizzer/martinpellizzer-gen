    "intro": "Echinocactus exsculptus, commonly known as the Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that form a compact, spherical shape. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the base of the spines during the warmer months. Echinocactus exsculptus is well adapted to desert conditions, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan."
