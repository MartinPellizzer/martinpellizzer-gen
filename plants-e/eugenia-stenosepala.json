    "intro": "Eugenia stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with four to five sepals and petals, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible. Eugenia stenosepala is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
