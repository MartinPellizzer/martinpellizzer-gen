    "intro": "Ectrosiopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining environment, Ectrosiopsis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
