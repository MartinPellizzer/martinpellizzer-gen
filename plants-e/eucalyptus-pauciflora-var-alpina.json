    "intro": "Eucalyptus pauciflora var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine snow gum, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its glaucous blue-green foliage and smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
