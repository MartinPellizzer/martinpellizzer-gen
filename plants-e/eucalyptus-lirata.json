    "intro": "Eucalyptus lirata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers, which are typically clustered in groups of three. Eucalyptus lirata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and salt. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils."
