    "intro": "Elytrigia \u00d7 obtusiuscula, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three spikelets per branch, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This species is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage crop."
