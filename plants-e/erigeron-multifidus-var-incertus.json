    "intro": "Erigeron multifidus var. incertus, commonly known as the uncertain fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils, and it produces showy white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and often branching. This variant is considered a subspecies with some taxonomic uncertainty, contributing to its name."
