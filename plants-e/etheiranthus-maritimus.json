    "intro": "Etheiranthus maritimus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing along rocky shores and dunes. Its ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Etheiranthus maritimus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
