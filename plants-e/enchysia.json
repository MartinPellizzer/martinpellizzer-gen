    "intro": "Enchysia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. Enchysia species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plants often have a rosette growth habit, with leaves arranged in a compact circle around the stem. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
