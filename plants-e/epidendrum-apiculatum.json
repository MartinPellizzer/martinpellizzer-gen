    "intro": "Epidendrum apiculatum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, and it produces long, slender roots that help anchor it to its host. Epidendrum apiculatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
