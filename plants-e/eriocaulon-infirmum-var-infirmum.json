    "intro": "Eriocaulon infirmum var. infirmum, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental water gardens."
