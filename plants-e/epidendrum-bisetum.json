It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces two flowers per spike, which are often arranged symmetrically and have a velvety texture. Epidendrum bisetum thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. It prefers well-draining soil and indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
