    "intro": "Eugenia aprica, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pink guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct flavor. Eugenia aprica thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display. It prefers well-drained soil and full sunlight for optimal growth."
