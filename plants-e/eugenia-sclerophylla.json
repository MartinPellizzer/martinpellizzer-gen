    "intro": "Eugenia sclerophylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, which are clustered in umbels and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Eugenia sclerophylla is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand drought and fire."
