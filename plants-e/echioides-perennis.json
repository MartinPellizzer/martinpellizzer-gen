    "intro": "Echioides perennis, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming throughout the warmer months. The plant has a compact growth habit, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant. Its scientific name reflects its resemblance to the genus Echioides, which includes similar species with similar floral structures."
