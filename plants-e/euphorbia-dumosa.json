    "intro": "Euphorbia dumosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
