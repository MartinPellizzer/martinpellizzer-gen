    "intro": "Eragrostis stenoclada, commonly known as narrowleaf beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Eragrostis stenoclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
