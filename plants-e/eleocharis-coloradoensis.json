    "intro": "Eleocharis coloradoensis, commonly known as the Colorado sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in prairies and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland ecosystems. Eleocharis coloradoensis is native to the western United States, particularly Colorado, and is adapted to the region's semi-arid to moist environments."
