    "intro": "Epidendrum fimbria, commonly known as the fringed epidendron, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, hanging inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, are highly ornamental and attract various pollinators."
