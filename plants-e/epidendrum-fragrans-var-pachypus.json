It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a yellow or green lip. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the old ones. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. This orchid thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
