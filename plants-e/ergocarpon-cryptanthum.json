    "intro": "Ergocarpon cryptanthum, commonly known as the cryptic earth tongue, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Trapeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on decaying wood in temperate regions. Its structure and composition make it an important indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
