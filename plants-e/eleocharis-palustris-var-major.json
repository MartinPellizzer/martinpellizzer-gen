    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris var. major, commonly known as the greater spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond margins. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The species is also valued for its role in phytoremediation, as it can absorb heavy metals and pollutants from contaminated water."
