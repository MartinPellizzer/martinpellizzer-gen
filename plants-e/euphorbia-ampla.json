    "intro": "Euphorbia ampla, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Euphorbia ampla is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems to survive in arid conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
