    "intro": "Epipactis palustris var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, leafy stems and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its roots are fibrous, and it has a rhizomatous growth habit that allows it to spread vegetatively. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora."
