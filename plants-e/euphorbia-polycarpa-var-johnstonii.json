    "intro": "Euphorbia polycarpa var. johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
