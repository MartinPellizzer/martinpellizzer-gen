    "intro": "Epilobium concinnum, commonly known as narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. The plant has slender, often reddish stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming in the summer months. Epilobium concinnum is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
