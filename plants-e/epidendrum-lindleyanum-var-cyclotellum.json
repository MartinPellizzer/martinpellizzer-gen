    "intro": "Epidendrum lindleyanum var. cyclotellum, commonly known as the cyclocarpic epidendrum, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are sword-shaped and can form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure that supports its epiphytic lifestyle. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
