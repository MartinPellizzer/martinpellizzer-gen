    "intro": "Evolvulus pumilus, commonly known as the small morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with prostrate or trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. Evolvulus pumilus is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental flowers and ease of growth."
