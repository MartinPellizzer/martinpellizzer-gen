    "intro": "Espeletia pycnophylla var. galerana, commonly known as the Galerana heather, is a perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale purple flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
