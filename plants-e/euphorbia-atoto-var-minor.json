    "intro": "Euphorbia atoto var. minor, commonly known as the lesser atoto spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
