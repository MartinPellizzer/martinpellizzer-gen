    "intro": "Epidendrum triloboleptophytum, commonly known as the Three-lobed Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting dark center. Its leaves are typically broad and elongated, adapted to capture moisture and light in its natural habitat. This orchid thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
