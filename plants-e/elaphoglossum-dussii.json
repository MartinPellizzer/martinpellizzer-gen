    "intro": "Elaphoglossum dussii, commonly known as the Dussi\u2019s holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family. Elaphoglossum dussii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
