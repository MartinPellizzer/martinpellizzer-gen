    "intro": "Elaeagnus glabra var. jotanii, commonly known as the Jotani silverleaf, is a shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that are yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in harsh environmental conditions."
