    "intro": "Epimedium sagittatum var. pyramidale, commonly known as the barrenwort or bishop's hat, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The foliage consists of heart-shaped, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded woodland conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in moist, well-drained soils."
