    "intro": "Elaphoglossum angulatum, commonly known as the angled harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- to tri-pinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Elaphoglossum angulatum is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in shaded gardens."
