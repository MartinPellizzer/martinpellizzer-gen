    "intro": "Echinocereus arizonicus subsp. nigrihorridispinus, commonly known as the black-horned hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles and clusters of short, dark spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and rockeries."
