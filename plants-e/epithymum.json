    "intro": "Epithymum, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, velvety foliage and showy, long-lasting flowers that come in a variety of colors. Epithymum species typically grow as compact, bushy shrubs with upright stems. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The genus includes several species, with Epithymum densiflorum being one of the most popular for its vibrant blooms and ease of care."
