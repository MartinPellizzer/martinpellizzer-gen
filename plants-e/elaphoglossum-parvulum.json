    "intro": "Elaphoglossum parvulum, commonly known as the small fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically measure less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on rocky or shaded ground. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Elaphoglossum parvulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden environments."
