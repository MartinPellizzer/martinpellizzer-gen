    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. cinereum, commonly known as the silverweed or common erodium, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hairy capsule that splits open to release the seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in gardens, and in dry, open habitats."
