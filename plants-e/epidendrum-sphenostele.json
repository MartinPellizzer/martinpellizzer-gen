    "intro": "Epidendrum sphenostele, commonly known as the narrow-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and linear, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. It thrives in humid, well-draining environments and prefers bright, indirect light. Epidendrum sphenostele is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
