    "intro": "Evolvulus ericifolius var. singuliflorus, commonly known as the single-flower woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and produces a single, showy blue or violet flower per stem. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its unique morphology and limited floral display make it an interesting subject for botanical study. It is also noted for its ability to tolerate drought conditions."
