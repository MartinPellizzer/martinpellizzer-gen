    "intro": "Eugenia flavifolia, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
