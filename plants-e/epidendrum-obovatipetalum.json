    "intro": "Epidendrum obovatipetalum, commonly known as the broad-petalled epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with broad, ovate petals and a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its inflorescence is often racemose, bearing several blooms that can last for several weeks. The leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat."
