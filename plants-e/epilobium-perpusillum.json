    "intro": "Epilobium perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with slender, often reddish stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and areas with high humidity. Epilobium perpusillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
