    "intro": "Elatostema caveanum, commonly known as the cave bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or along stream banks. Elatostema caveanum is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in humid, low-light conditions."
