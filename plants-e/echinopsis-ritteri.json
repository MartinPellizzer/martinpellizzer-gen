    "intro": "Echinopsis ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant has a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. It is a succulent, storing water in its thick stem to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis ritteri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its brief, dramatic flowering display."
