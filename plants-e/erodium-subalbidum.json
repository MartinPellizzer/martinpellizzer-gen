It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
