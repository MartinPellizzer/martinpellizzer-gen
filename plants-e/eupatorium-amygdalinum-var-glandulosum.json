    "intro": "Eupatorium amygdalinum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular false dragonhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring erect, branched stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in glandular dots, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
