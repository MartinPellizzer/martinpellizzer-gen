It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, waxy leaves. Its unique morphology includes a basal rosette structure and a tendency to produce a milky sap when damaged. Euphorbia clandestina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
