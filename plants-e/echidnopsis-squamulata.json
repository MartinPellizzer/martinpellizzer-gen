    "intro": "Echidnopsis squamulata, commonly known as the squamulose ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and rocks, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival."
