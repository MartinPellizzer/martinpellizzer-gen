    "intro": "Elaeagnus hortensis var. igda, commonly known as the silverberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its silvery foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance, and its small, edible berries that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. It produces fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its characteristic berries. The silverberry is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
