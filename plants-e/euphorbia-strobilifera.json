    "intro": "Euphorbia strobilifera, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that resemble small pine cones, which are actually clusters of tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
