    "intro": "Epidendrum ramonense, commonly known as the Ramon Orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, brightly colored flowers. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
