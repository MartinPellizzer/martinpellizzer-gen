    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus var. violaceus, commonly known as the purple wheatgrass, is a variant of the wheatgrass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth and bluish-green to purple-colored foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a forage species for livestock."
