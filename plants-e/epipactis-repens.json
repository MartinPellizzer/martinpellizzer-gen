    "intro": "Epipactis repens, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a loose cluster. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Epipactis repens is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, making it a persistent component of its native habitats."
