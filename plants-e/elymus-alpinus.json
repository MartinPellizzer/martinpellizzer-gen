    "intro": "Elymus alpinus, commonly known as alpine needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Elymus alpinus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
