    "intro": "Eugenia sandakanensis, commonly known as the Bornean guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, yellowish-orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
