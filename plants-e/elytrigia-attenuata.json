    "intro": "Elytrigia attenuata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats."
