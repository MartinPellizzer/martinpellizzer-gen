    "intro": "Epidendrum ornatum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a waxy coating. Epidendrum ornatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
