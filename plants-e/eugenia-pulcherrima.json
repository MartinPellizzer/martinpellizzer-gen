    "intro": "Eugenia pulcherrima, commonly known as poinsettia, is a tropical shrub native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The true flowers are small and inconspicuous, located at the center of the bract clusters. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value during the holiday season. Its foliage is typically dark green, and it has a woody stem with a slightly aromatic scent."
