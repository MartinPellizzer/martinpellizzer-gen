    "intro": "Eritrichium villosum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate structure and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
