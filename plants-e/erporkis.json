    "intro": "Erporkis, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blossoms that open at night and close by dawn. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a strong, sweet fragrance. Its climbing habit requires support, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with plenty of sunlight. The flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported calming properties."
