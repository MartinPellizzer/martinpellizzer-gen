    "intro": "Eriotheca obcordata, commonly known as the obcordate eriotheca, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy leaves that are obcordate in shape, meaning they are heart-shaped with the base narrow. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are usually pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eriotheca obcordata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
