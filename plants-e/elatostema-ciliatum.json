    "intro": "Elatostema ciliatum, commonly known as the creeping mouse ear, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with hairy margins, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Elatostema ciliatum is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
