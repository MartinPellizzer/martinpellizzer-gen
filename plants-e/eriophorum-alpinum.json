    "intro": "Eriophorum alpinum, commonly known as alpine cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescence that resembles cotton, which is composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Its leaves are grass-like and form a rosette near the ground, while the flowering stems rise above them. Eriophorum alpinum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its harsh environment."
