It is native to South America, particularly found in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped to ovate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often grown for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. The species is also related to the coca plant, though it is not typically used for psychoactive purposes."
