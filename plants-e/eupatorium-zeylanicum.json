    "intro": "Eupatorium zeylanicum, commonly known as Indian boneset, is a perennial herb native to South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in moist habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. Its name derives from the brittle, woody stems that break easily, resembling bones."
