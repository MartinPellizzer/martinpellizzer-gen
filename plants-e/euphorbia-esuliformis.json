    "intro": "Euphorbia esuliformis, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically small and may be reduced or absent in mature plants. Euphorbia esuliformis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and unique appearance."
