    "intro": "Eremosparton aphyllum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Eremosparton aphyllum is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems."
