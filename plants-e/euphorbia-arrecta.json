    "intro": "Euphorbia arrecta, commonly known as the upright spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive upright stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
