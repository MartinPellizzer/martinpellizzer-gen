    "intro": "Elatostema rupicola, commonly known as the rock elatostem, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in open, sunny habitats. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, white or pale green flowers during the warmer months. Elatostema rupicola is well adapted to arid conditions, with a shallow root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
