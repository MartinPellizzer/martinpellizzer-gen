    "intro": "Euphorbia antisyphilitica var. typica, commonly known as the Syphilitic Spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and yellowish-green sap. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Euphorbia. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling."
