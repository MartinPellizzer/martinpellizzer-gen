    "intro": "Euphorbia atrorubens, commonly known as the red-black spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia atrorubens is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
