    "intro": "Ehrharta deflexa, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, greenish-brown structures that mature into seeds. Ehrharta deflexa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
