    "intro": "Endiandra gillespiei, commonly known as the Queensland endiandra, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It is a shrub that thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understorey of subtropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
