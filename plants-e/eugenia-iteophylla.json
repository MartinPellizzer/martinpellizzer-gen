    "intro": "Eugenia iteophylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of northern Australia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically 5\u201315 cm long and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in saline or brackish environments and is often found in mangrove swamps or tidal zones. Eugenia iteophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in coastal ecosystems."
