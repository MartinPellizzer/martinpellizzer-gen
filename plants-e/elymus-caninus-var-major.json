    "intro": "Elymus caninus var. major, commonly known as the tall cat's-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a cat's tail, composed of tightly packed spikelets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
