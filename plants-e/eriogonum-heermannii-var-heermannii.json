    "intro": "Eriogonum heermannii var. heermannii, commonly known as the Heermann's wild buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky hillsides. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
