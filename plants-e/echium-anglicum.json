    "intro": "Echium anglicum, commonly known as the common thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple or blue flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant has spiny leaves and stems, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Echium anglicum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional remedies."
