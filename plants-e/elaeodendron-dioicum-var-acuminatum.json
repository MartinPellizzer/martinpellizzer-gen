    "intro": "Elaeodendron dioicum var. acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elaeodendron, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dioecious nature, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. The plant typically grows as a shrub with lanceolate leaves that are often sharply pointed at the tips. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-white in color, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
