    "intro": "Eugenia vernicosa, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring dark green, elliptical leaves that are glossy and often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, dark blue to black berries. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for landscaping and hedges. Eugenia vernicosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resistance to pests and diseases."
