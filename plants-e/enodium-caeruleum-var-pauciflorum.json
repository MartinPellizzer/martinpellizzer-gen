    "intro": "Enodium caeruleum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a striking perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
