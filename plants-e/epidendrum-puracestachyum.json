    "intro": "Epidendrum puracestachyum, commonly known as the Puracestachyum Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, often fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Epidendrum puracestachyum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
