    "intro": "Epipogium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species. It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are often hidden within the leaf litter. It is native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia, growing in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
