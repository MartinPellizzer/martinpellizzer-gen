    "intro": "Escallonia paniculata var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering escallonia, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is prized in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
