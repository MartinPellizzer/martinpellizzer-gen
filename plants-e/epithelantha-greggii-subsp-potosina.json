    "intro": "Epithelantha greggii subsp. potosina, commonly known as the Potosino prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red to purple fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
