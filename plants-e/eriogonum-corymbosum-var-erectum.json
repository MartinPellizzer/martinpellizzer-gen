It is characterized by its erect growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
