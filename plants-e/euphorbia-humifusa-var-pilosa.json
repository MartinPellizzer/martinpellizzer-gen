    "intro": "Euphorbia humifusa var. pilosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
