    "intro": "Elaeocarpus submonoceras subsp. procerus, commonly known as the slender-lobed elaeocarp, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly pubescent surface. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with white or pale pink petals, while the fruit is a woody drupe with a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. The plant has limited commercial use but is of interest in botanical research due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
