It is characterized by its pendulous, yellow-green flower spikes that emit a faint citrus aroma. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The flowers bloom in clusters, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
