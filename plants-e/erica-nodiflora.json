    "intro": "Erica nodiflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes various heather and related plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Erica nodiflora produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is well adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure."
