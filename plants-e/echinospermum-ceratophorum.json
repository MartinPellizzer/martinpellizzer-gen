It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny seed pods that encase the seeds. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to thrive in arid environments, and it is often found in disturbed soils. The species is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
