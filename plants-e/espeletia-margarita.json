    "intro": "Espeletia margarita, commonly known as the white globemallow, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean cloud forests. Its structure consists of a short, woody stem with clustered leaves and a spherical inflorescence that resembles a globe. Espeletia margarita plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its environment."
