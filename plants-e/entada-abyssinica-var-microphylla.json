    "intro": "Entada abyssinica var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved African trumpet tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and long, slender pods that contain toxic seeds. The leaves are small, alternate, and trifoliate, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savannas and woodland areas. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
