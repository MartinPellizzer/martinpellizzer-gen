    "intro": "Elaphoglossum castaneum, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Elaphoglossum castaneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
