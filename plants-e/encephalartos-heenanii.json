    "intro": "Encephalartos heenanii, commonly known as the Henean's cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that are typically green when young and turn brown as they mature. Encephalartos heenanii is a slow-growing plant that prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
