    "intro": "Echinocactus tortuosus, commonly known as the twisted hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, typically blooming at night. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Echinocactus tortuosus is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and requires minimal watering to thrive."
