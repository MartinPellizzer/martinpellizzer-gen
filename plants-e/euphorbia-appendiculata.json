    "intro": "Euphorbia appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which can be toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is adapted to survive in environments with limited water availability."
