    "intro": "Euphorbia kurtzii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, typical of many euphorbias. Its leaves are often fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Euphorbia kurtzii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
