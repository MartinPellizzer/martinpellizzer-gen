    "intro": "Eutoca litoralis, commonly known as the coastal eutoca, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to saline and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy or muddy soils along shorelines. Eutoca litoralis plays a role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
