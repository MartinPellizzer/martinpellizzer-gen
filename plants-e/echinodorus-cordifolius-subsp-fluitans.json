It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread easily in aquatic environments. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with moderate to high light exposure. Its attractive appearance makes it a popular choice for aquariums and pond landscaping."
