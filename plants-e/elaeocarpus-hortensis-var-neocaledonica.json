    "intro": "Elaeocarpus hortensis var. neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia elaeocarpus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany and ecological research. This variety is notable for its unique adaptations to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat."
