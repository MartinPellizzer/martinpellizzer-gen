    "intro": "Eysenhardtia spinosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Eysenhardtia spinosa is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can withstand prolonged droughts. Its ecological role includes providing shelter and food for various desert wildlife species."
