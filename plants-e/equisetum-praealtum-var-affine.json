    "intro": "Equisetum praealtum var. affine, commonly known as the variable horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ability to form dense colonies and its historical use in traditional medicine."
