    "intro": "Elymus divaricatus, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-tinged leaves and tall, cylindrical seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. Its flowering period is usually from July to September, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Elymus divaricatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
