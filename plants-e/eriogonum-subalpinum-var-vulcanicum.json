    "intro": "Eriogonum subalpinum var. vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic sandbagger, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and produces clusters of small, yellowish to greenish flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high elevations and coastal areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
