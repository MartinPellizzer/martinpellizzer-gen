    "intro": "Ephedrides, commonly known as ephedra, are a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ephedraceae. They are characterized by their shrub-like growth form and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The stems of ephedra species contain alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which has been used in traditional medicine. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in dry, rocky environments. Their evolutionary adaptations include reduced leaves and a thick cuticle to minimize water loss."
