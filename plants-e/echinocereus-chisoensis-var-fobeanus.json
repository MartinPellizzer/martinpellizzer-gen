    "intro": "Echinocereus chisoensis var. fobeanus, commonly known as the Chisos hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spine-tipped cactus native to the Chisos Mountains in Texas. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with a gray-green to blue-gray coloration, often covered in a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically borne in the axils of the areoles. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
