    "intro": "Erica coarctata var. longipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
