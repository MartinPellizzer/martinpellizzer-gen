    "intro": "Erica ferrea var. crenata, commonly known as the coastal heath or sand heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica ferrea var. crenata is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and strong winds."
