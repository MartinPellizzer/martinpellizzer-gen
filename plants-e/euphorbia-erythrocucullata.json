    "intro": "Euphorbia erythrocucullata, commonly known as the red-hooded spurge, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with large, fleshy, green leaves that have a distinctive red or purple coloration on the underside. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by colorful bracts that resemble a hood, giving it its common name. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic milky sap and should be handled with care."
