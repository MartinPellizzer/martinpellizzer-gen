It features tall, slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its name refers to the brittle, bone-like appearance of its stems. Eupatorium ossaeanum is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
