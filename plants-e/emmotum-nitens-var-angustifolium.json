    "intro": "Emmotum nitens var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf emmotum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features slender, angular stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a narrow, pointed tip. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is characterized by a distinct, aromatic scent, which contributes to its ecological interactions with pollinators. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
