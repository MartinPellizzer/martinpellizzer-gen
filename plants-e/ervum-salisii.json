    "intro": "Ervum salisii, commonly known as the saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in saline and arid soils. Ervum salisii is often used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
