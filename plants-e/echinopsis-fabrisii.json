    "intro": "Echinopsis fabrisii, commonly known as the Fabrisii cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming at night. It is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts."
