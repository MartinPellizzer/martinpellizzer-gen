The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring spines for protection and reduced leaves to minimize water loss. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to green, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other cacti in the genus. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
