    "intro": "Euphorbia imbricata f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf leaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact and bushy appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
