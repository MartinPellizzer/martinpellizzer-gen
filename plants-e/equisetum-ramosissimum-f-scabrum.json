    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum f. scabrum, commonly known as the scaly horse tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of stiff, scaly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This fern-like plant is considered a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history."
