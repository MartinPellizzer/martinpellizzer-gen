    "intro": "Erythranthe norrisii, commonly known as Norris's monkeyflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its vibrant red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and canyon walls. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
