    "intro": "Euphorbia graminea var. novogaliciana, commonly known as the Alpine Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for gardeners interested in low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
