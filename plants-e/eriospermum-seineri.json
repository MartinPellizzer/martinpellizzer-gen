    "intro": "Eriospermum seineri, commonly known as the sticky everlasting or desert everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is known for its dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Eriospermum seineri is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
