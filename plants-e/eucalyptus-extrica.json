    "intro": "Eucalyptus extrica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and fire. Eucalyptus extrica plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
