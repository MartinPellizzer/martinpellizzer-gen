    "intro": "Euphorbia characias var. veneta, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of thick, waxy, blue-green leaves that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
