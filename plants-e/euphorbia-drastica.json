    "intro": "Euphorbia drastica, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to extreme heat and minimal rainfall, making it a resilient species in desert environments. Euphorbia drastica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
