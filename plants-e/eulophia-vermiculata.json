It features a slender, erect stem with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Eulophia vermiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
