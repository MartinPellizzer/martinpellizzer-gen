It is characterized by its compact, branching growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms during the warmer months, with flower spikes emerging from the nodes along the stems. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees or other surfaces in its natural habitat. Epidendrum apicilatum requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
