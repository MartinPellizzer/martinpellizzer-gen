    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. stokesii, commonly known as Stokes' euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
