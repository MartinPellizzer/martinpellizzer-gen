    "intro": "Erica guthriei var. guthriei, commonly known as the Guthrie's heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
