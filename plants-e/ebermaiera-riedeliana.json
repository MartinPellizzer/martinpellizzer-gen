It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a glossy surface that helps it retain moisture.
