    "intro": "Erica rubiginosa var. rubiginosa, commonly known as the red heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its production of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Erica rubiginosa var. rubiginosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
