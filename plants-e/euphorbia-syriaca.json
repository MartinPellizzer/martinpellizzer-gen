    "intro": "Euphorbia syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a stout, branching stem covered with small, greenish-yellow leaves that are often succulent. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to arid environments. Euphorbia syriaca is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritant to skin and is used in traditional medicine."
