    "intro": "Encyclia cogniauxii, commonly known as the Cogniaux's pineapple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and striking, pineapple-like inflorescence. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Encyclia cogniauxii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
