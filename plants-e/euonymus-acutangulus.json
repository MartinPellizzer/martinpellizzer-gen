It features striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has alternate, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. Euonymus acutangulus is often cultivated for its vibrant seasonal color and adaptability to various soil conditions."
