    "intro": "Embadium johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's embadium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often emerging from the base of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found in rocky or clay soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
