    "intro": "Euphorbia duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Euphorbia duclouxii is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sunlight."
