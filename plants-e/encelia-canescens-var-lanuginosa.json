    "intro": "Encelia canescens var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly bluecurls, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and clusters of blue to violet tubular flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in drought conditions, and it is adapted to coastal and inland desert habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
