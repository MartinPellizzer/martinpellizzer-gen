    "intro": "Elaphoglossum gonzalesiae, commonly known as the Gonzalesia holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and finely divided, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
