    "intro": "Epidendrum coordinatum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a contrasting purple or red lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often in humid tropical environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum coordinatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
