It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are clustered in whorls. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
