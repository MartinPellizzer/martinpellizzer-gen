    "intro": "Eclopes trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that produce aerial roots. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with three distinct veins running from the base, giving it its common name. Eclopes trinervis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
