    "intro": "Eriocaulon horsley-kundae var. megalocephalum, commonly known as the giant-headed spike-rush, is a grass-like plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a spike, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. This variety is distinguished by its large, prominent flower heads, which give it its common name."
