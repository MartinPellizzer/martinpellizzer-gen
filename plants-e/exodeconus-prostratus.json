    "intro": "Exodeconus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate exodeconus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
