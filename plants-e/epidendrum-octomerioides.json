    "intro": "Epidendrum octomerioides, commonly known as the Orchid of the Andes, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces fragrant, colorful blossoms that attract pollinators. This species is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in its native habitat."
