    "intro": "Eugenia mirabilis, commonly known as the star apple or carambola, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces distinctive star-shaped fruits with a crisp, juicy pulp that ranges in color from green to yellow. The fruit's unique appearance and sweet-tart flavor make it a popular ornamental and edible plant. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
