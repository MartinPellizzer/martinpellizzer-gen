    "intro": "Eleocharis quadrangulata, commonly known as the four-angle sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, swales, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often four-sided, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in dense spikelets, and it produces tiny, dry fruits called achenes. Eleocharis quadrangulata plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is often found in regions with temperate climates."
