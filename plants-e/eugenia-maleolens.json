    "intro": "Eugenia maleolens, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking red, bell-shaped flowers that bloom during the Christmas season, hence its common name. It typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The leaves are glossy and elliptical, while the fruit is a small, fleshy berry that is edible but not widely consumed."
