    "intro": "Erythroxylum cyclophyllum, commonly known as the cyclophyll coca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries containing seeds. It is closely related to other species of coca and has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes. Due to its botanical similarities to Erythroxylum coca, it has also been the subject of scientific and legal interest."
