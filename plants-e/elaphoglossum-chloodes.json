    "intro": "Elaphoglossum chloodes, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Elaphoglossum chloodes plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
