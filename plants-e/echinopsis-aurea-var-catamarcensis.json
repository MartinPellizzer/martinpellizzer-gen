    "intro": "Echinopsis aurea var. catamarcensis, commonly known as the Catamarcensis moon cactus, is a succulent native to Argentina. It features a swollen, bulbous stem that stores water, typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually absent, with spines covering the stem for protection. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
