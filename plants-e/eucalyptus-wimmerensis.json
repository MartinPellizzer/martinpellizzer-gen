    "intro": "Eucalyptus wimmerensis, commonly known as the Wimmera gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey to white bark that peels in thin sheets, and its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The tree produces creamy-white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for construction and fuel. Eucalyptus wimmerensis is adapted to dry, inland climates and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
