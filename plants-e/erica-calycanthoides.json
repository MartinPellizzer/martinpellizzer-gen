    "intro": "Erica calycanthoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of its branches. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is typically found in coastal shrublands or rocky habitats. Due to its unique adaptations to coastal conditions, it is an important component of its native ecosystem."
