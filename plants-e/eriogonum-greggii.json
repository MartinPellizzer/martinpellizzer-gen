It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Eriogonum greggii is adapted to arid environments, with succulent leaves that help store water. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
