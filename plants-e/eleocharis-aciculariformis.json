    "intro": "Eleocharis aciculariformis, commonly known as the needle-leaved spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant produces tiny, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain minute flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Eleocharis aciculariformis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
