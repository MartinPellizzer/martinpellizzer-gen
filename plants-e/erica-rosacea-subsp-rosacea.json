    "intro": "Erica rosacea subsp. rosacea, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, needle-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh maritime environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
