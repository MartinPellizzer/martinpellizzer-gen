    "intro": "Espeletia smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, daisy-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or volcanic soils at high altitudes, often in areas with strong winds. Its structure includes a short, stout stem with tightly packed, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. Espeletia smithiana is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and distinctive member of its ecosystem."
