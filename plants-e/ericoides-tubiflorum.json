    "intro": "Ericoides tubiflorum, commonly known as the tuberous-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system forms dense mats, helping to stabilize soils in sandy or coastal environments. Ericoides tubiflorum is adapted to harsh, well-drained conditions and is often found in maritime chaparral habitats."
