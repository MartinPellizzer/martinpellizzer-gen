    "intro": "Eremothera refracta, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its showy yellow to orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eremothera refracta is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in harsh, drought-prone habitats."
