    "intro": "Eleocharis minarum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions. It typically grows to a height of about 20 to 40 centimeters, with slender, cylindrical stems that bear spike-like clusters of tiny, spikelet-based flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis minarum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
