    "intro": "Euphorbia brasiliensis f. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Brazil. It features thick, fleshy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers during the dry season, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in drought conditions."
