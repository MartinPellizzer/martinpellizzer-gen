    "intro": "Erythrina excelsa, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has compound leaves with three leaflets and produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Erythrina excelsa also plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
