    "intro": "Eriocaulon miquelianum var. involucratum, commonly known as the velvet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky layer of hair, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in shallow, still water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often studied for its potential in wetland restoration projects."
