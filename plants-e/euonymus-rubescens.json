    "intro": "Euonymus rubescens, commonly known as the redstem dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall color and attractive foliage throughout the growing season. Euonymus rubescens is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
