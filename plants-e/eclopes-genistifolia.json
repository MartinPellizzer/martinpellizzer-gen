    "intro": "Eclopes genistifolia, commonly known as the creeping thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its thorny nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
