    "intro": "Eriocarpum floridanum, commonly known as the Florida eriocephalum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
