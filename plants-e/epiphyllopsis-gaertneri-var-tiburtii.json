    "intro": "Epiphyllopsis gaertneri var. tiburtii, commonly known as the Alpine snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
