    "intro": "Epidendrum sulcatum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with numerous pendulous inflorescences that bear showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its often-dry habitat. Its unique, zigzag-shaped flower stems are a distinguishing characteristic. Epidendrum sulcatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
