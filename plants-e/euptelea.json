    "intro": "Euptelea, commonly known as the Chinese catalpa, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Nyssaceae. It consists of a single species, Euptelea microphylla, which is native to China and is considered a relic from the Tertiary period. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. Its flowers are fragrant and typically borne in clusters, and it produces distinctive elongated seed pods. Euptelea is notable for its ecological significance and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
