    "intro": "Eugenia carissoides, commonly known as the pink hibiscus mealybug plant, is a flowering shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features dark green, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. However, it is also a host plant for the pink hibiscus mealybug, which can cause significant damage to nearby plants."
