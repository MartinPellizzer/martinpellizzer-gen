    "intro": "Euphorbia pinea subsp. portlandica, commonly known as Portland euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of southern England. It features grey-green, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and withstand salty sea air. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic floral structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
