    "intro": "Epidendrum alatum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with large, colorful flowers that can range from white to pink and purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
