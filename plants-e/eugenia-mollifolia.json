    "intro": "Eugenia mollifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
