It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and it thrives in full sun. Erechtites organensis produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that distinguishes it from other similar species."
