    "intro": "Echinocereus pulchellus subsp. sharpii, commonly known as the Sharpe's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular to cylindrical shape, often featuring a dense covering of white or pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
