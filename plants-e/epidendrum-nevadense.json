    "intro": "Epidendrum nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada Epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with bright yellow to orange flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Epidendrum nevadense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and adequate sunlight."
