    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium subsp. minus, commonly known as narrowleaf cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wet meadow habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other subspecies of Eriophorum angustifolium."
