    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus phyllacanthus, commonly known as the Phyllacanthus cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, ribbed stem structure and spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
