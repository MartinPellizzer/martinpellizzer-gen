    "intro": "Eugenia nitens, commonly known as the silver-leaved eucalyptus, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Eugenia nitens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open forests or heathlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
