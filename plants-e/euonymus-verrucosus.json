    "intro": "Euonymus verrucosus, commonly known as the roughleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and alternate, simple, elliptical leaves that are often covered in small, raised dots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red, inflated seed capsules that split open to release seeds. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Euonymus verrucosus is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
