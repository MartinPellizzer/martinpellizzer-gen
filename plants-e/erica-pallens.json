    "intro": "Erica pallens, commonly known as the silver heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica pallens thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its hardiness and attractive foliage."
