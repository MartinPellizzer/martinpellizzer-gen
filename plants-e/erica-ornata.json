    "intro": "Erica ornata, commonly known as the sweet heather, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Erica ornata is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and ability to form dense, low-growing shrubs. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
