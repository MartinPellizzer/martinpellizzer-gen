    "intro": "Eriogonum nutans var. brevipedicellatum, commonly known as the short-stalked buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of Eriogonum nutans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
