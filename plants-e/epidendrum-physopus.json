    "intro": "Epidendrum physopus, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, making it one of the most striking orchids in the genus. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of white or gray pubescence. The species is noted for its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several months under optimal growing conditions."
