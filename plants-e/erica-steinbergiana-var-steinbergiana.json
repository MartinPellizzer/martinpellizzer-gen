It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This versatile plant is popular in rock gardens and as a container specimen due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
