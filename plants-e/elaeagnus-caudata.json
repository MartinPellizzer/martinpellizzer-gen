    "intro": "Elaeagnus caudata, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in the fall. Elaeagnus caudata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
