    "intro": "Euphorbia millspaughii, commonly known as the \"Mexican firechi\" or \"red torch cactus,\" is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces vibrant orange to red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers, and small yellow flowers that appear in the axils of the leaves. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a striking addition to arid landscapes."
