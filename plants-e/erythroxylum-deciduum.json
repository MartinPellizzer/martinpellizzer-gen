    "intro": "Erythroxylum deciduum, commonly known as the deciduous erythroxylum, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which fall off during the dry season. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a reddish hue, and it produces berries that contain the seeds. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to seasonal climates."
