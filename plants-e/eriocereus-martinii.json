    "intro": "Eriocereus martinii, commonly known as the Martin's night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spineless stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours before closing in the morning. Eriocereus martinii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal flowering habit."
