    "intro": "Elaeagnus pingnanensis, commonly known as the Pingnan silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Elaeagnus pingnanensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
