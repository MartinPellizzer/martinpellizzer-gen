It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and features small, spiny leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in Mediterranean climates."
