    "intro": "Euphorbia melanohydrata subsp. conica, commonly known as the conical euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, upright, conical stem that is often covered in a waxy, pale green or greyish coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant."
