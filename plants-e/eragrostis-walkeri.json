    "intro": "Eragrostis walkeri, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish spikelets. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and drought tolerance."
