It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne in tight, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
