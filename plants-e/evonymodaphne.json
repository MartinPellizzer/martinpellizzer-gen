These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. They are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The fruits are typically drupes, containing a single seed, and are often used in traditional medicine. Evonymodaphne species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which is used in carpentry and furniture-making."
