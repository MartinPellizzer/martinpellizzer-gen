    "intro": "Echinops villosissimus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echinops villosissimus produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
