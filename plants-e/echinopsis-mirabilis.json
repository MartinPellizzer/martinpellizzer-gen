It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with spiny stems that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the evening and closing by morning. Echinopsis mirabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
