    "intro": "Eupatorium gonocladum, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in saturated soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The plant is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
