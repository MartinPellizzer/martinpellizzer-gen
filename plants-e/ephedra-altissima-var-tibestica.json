    "intro": "Ephedra altissima var. tibestica, commonly known as the Tibetan ephedra, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to arid and cold environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing the seeds. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh mountainous conditions. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
