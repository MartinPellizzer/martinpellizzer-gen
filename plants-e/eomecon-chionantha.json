    "intro": "Eomecon chionantha, commonly known as the snowball plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white, fluffy flowers that appear in late winter or early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are actinomorphic and consist of numerous petal-like structures called bracts. Eomecon chionantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
