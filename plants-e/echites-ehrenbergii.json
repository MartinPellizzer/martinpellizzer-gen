    "intro": "Echites ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fibrous roots allow it to survive in poor soil conditions and store water efficiently. Echites ehrenbergii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant landscaping."
