It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia kazerouni is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
