    "intro": "Epithymum coryli, commonly known as the hazel-leaved epithymum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of hazel trees. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Epithymum coryli is native to southern Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
