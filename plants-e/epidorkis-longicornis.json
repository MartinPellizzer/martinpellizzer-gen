    "intro": "Epidorkis longicornis, commonly known as the longhorned leafhopper, is a small insect belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive long antennae, which are often longer than its body. The plant's botanical relevance lies in its role as a herbivorous pest that feeds on the sap of various plants, including crops and ornamental species. Its feeding activity can lead to the transmission of plant pathogens, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings. The species is widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions, where it thrives in diverse vegetation types."
