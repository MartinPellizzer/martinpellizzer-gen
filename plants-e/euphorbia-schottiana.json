    "intro": "Euphorbia schottiana, commonly known as the Schott's spurge, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in soft, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, giving it a dramatic appearance. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
