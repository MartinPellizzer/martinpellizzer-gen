    "intro": "Erysimum hieraciifolium var. helveticum, commonly known as the Swiss wallflower, is a low-growing annual plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, fuzzy coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found growing on mountain slopes and in disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and visually striking addition to alpine gardens."
