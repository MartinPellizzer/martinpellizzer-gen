    "intro": "Euphorbia diazlunana, commonly known as the Dragon's Blood Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it well adapted to dry environments. However, it is also noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
