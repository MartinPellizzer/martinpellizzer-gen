    "intro": "Elleanthus lupulinus, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of North America. It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its stem is upright and branched, with small, cup-like structures at the base that hold water, aiding in drought resistance. The botanical name reflects its association with the genus *Elleanthus* and its distinctive yellow floral coloration."
