    "intro": "Eucalyptus rigidula subsp. rigidula, commonly known as the rigid ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. This species is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
