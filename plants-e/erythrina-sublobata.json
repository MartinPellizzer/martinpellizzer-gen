    "intro": "Erythrina sublobata, commonly known as the red flame acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking red and orange floral clusters that appear during the dry season. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often woody and branched. Erythrina sublobata produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder."
