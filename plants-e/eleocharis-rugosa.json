    "intro": "Eleocharis rugosa, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies, making it a common component of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Eleocharis rugosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
