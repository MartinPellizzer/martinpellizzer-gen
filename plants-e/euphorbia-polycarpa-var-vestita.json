    "intro": "Euphorbia polycarpa var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
