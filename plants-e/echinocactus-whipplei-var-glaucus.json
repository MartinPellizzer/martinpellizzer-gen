It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant features a dense covering of blue-gray spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stem during the summer months. This variety is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
