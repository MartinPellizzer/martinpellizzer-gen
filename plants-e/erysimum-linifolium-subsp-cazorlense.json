    "intro": "Erysimum linifolium subsp. cazorlense, commonly known as the Cazorla wallflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
