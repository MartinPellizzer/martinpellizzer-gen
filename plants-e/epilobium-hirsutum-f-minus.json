    "intro": "Epilobium hirsutum f. minus, commonly known as the lesser willowherb, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. It is a flowering plant in the family Onagraceae, native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its foliage is usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This form is a natural variation of the broader Epilobium hirsutum species, showing reduced growth habits and floral characteristics."
