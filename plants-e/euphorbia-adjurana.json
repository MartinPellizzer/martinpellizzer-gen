    "intro": "Euphorbia adjurana, commonly known as the Orange Tree or Red-veined Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in spiny, fleshy leaves that are often red-veined. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by colorful bracts. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
