    "intro": "Eutrema edwardsii subsp. compactum, commonly known as the dwarf seaside spinach, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it tolerates saline and wind-swept conditions. The plant features small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters, and it blooms during the cooler months. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
