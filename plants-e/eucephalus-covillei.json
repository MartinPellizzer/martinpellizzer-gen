    "intro": "Eucephalus covillei, commonly known as Coville's bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Coville's bluebunch wheatgrass is also noted for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
