It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
