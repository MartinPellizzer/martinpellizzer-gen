    "intro": "Eleocharis flavescens var. olivacea, commonly known as the olive bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often green to yellowish in color, with small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of marsh and pond ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its olive-green hue, which sets it apart from other Eleocharis species."
