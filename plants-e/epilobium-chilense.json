    "intro": "Epilobium chilense, commonly known as Chilean willow or Chilean fireweed, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Epilobium chilense is typically found in moist, open habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
