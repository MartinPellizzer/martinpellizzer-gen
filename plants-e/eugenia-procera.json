    "intro": "Eugenia procera, commonly known as the royal poinciana, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent pink bracts that resemble feathery plumes, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red or black berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Eugenia procera is also valued for its timber and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
