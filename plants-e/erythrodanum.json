    "intro": "Erythrodanum, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and intricate, orchid-like structure, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers bloom during the late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Erythrodanum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
