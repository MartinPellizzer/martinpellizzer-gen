    "intro": "Endopogon consanguineus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant is known for its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall ecological adaptability."
