    "intro": "Eucalyptus fraseri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallet, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or grey on the upper surface. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus fraseri is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Its essential oils, particularly cineole, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
