It is characterized by its dense, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
