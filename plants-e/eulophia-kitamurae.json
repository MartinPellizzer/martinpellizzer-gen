    "intro": "Eulophia kitamurae, commonly known as the Kitamura's eulophia, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces inflorescences with multiple pale yellow to greenish-white blooms, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eulophia kitamurae is considered a vulnerable species."
