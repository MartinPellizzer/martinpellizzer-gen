    "intro": "Echinopterys eglandulosa, commonly known as the smooth echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which are the structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Echinopterys eglandulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh conditions."
