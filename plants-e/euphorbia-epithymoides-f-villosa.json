    "intro": "Euphorbia epithymoides f. villosa, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The leaves are small, often reduced to scale-like structures, and the plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is prized for its ornamental appearance and ability to withstand arid conditions."
