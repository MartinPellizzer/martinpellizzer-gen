    "intro": "Euphorbia pallasiana, commonly known as the Pallas's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it stores water in its stems, making it well adapted to dry environments. Euphorbia pallasiana is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
