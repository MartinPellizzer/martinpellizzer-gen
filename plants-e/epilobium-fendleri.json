    "intro": "Epilobium fendleri, commonly known as desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often along rocky slopes or in sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, and it produces capsules as its fruit. Epilobium fendleri is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
