    "intro": "Euphorbia dressleri, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with a distinctive greenish-gray color and is covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
