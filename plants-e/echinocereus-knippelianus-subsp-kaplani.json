It is a short, cylindrical cactus with a ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study and cultivation."
