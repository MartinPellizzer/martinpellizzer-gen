    "intro": "Euphorbia longetuberculosa, commonly known as the long-tubercled spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, rounded tubercles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and ability to store water in its stems make it an interesting addition to xeriscapes and rock gardens."
