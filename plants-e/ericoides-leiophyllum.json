    "intro": "Ericoides leiophyllum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically smooth and waxy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Ericoides leiophyllum is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient plant in its native environment."
