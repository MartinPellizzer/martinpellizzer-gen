    "intro": "Eriocaulon stupeum, commonly known as the stunted flat sedge, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. Eriocaulon stupeum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
