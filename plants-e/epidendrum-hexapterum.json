    "intro": "Epidendrum hexapterum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Forest, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that often feature a combination of red, yellow, and orange hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum hexapterum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
