    "intro": "Epiphyllum russellianum var. gaertneri, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a hybrid species within the Cactaceae family. It is a flowering plant characterized by its segmented stems that resemble leaves, which are actually modified stems called cladodes. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming during the holiday season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This epiphytic plant is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
