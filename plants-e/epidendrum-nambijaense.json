    "intro": "Epidendrum nambijaense, commonly known as the Nambija orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Epidendrum nambijaense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
