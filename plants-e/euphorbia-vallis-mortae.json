    "intro": "Euphorbia vallis-mortae, commonly known as the death valley euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia vallis-mortae is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
