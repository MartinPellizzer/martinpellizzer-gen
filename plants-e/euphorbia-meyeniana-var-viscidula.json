    "intro": "Euphorbia meyeniana var. viscidula, commonly known as the sticky euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of South America. It features thick, ribbed stems covered in a sticky, resinous substance that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. The sticky resin also serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores."
