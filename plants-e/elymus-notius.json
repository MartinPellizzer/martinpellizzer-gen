    "intro": "Elymus notius, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence that resembles a spikelet. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Elymus notius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent erosion."
