It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small fauna."
