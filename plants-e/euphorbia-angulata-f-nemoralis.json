It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to regions of southern Africa. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the genus Euphorbia. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
