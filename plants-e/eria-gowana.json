    "intro": "Eria gowana, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Eria gowana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates."
