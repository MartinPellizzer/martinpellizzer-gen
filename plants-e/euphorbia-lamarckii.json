    "intro": "Euphorbia lamarckii, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in soft, greenish-gray leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is milky and can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia lamarckii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
