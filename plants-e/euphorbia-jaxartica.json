    "intro": "Euphorbia jaxartica, commonly known as the Jaxartian spurge, is a succulent plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia jaxartica is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
