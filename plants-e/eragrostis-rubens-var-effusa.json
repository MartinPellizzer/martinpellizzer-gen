It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish bracts. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. It is well adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
