    "intro": "Epithecia humilis, commonly known as the lowland epithecia, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in moist, shaded environments. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on calcareous substrates, such as limestone, in temperate regions. The plant's morphology and chemical composition make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
