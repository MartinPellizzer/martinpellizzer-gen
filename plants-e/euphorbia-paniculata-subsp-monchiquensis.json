    "intro": "Euphorbia paniculata subsp. monchiquensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features woody stems covered in a thick layer of yellowish, waxy resin, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal environments of its native habitat."
