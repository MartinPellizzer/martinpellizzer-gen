    "intro": "Eleocharis engelmannii var. detonsa, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
