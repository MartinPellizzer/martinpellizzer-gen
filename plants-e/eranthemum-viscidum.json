    "intro": "Eranthemum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky eranthemum, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sticky leaves help in deterring herbivores and may also aid in water retention."
