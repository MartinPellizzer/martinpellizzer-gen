It features opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
