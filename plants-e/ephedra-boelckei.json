    "intro": "Ephedra boelckei, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub-like plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems that often branch at the base and bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Ephedra boelckei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes has led to significant botanical and cultural interest."
