    "intro": "Encephalartos manikensis, commonly known as the Manikeni cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically yellowish-green in color. Encephalartos manikensis is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
