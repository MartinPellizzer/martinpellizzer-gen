    "intro": "Epistephium petiolatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Epistephium petiolatum is also an important host plant for certain butterfly species, contributing to local biodiversity."
