    "intro": "Euphorbia gaubae, commonly known as the golden crown, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a distinctive crown of yellow-orange tubular flowers surrounded by fleshy, spiny stems. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. It produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia gaubae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
