    "intro": "Elytrigia elongata, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Elytrigia elongata is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
