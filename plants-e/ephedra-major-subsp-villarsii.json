    "intro": "Ephedra major subsp. villarsii, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. Due to its medicinal properties and ecological role, it is an important species in its native habitats."
