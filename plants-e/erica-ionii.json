    "intro": "Erica ionii, commonly known as the Ionian heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Greek island of Ithaca. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica ionii thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
