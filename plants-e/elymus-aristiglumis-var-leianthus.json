    "intro": "Elymus aristiglumis var. leianthus, commonly known as the Hawaiian false brome, is a perennial grass native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
