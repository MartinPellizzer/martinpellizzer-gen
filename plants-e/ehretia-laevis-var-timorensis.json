    "intro": "Ehretia laevis var. timorensis, commonly known as the Timor ehretia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically glabrous and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in terminal or axillary clusters, which are followed by small, round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
