    "intro": "Echinocereus koehresianus, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 inches, featuring a globular shape and bright green stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments with minimal rainfall. The plant is well adapted to desert conditions, with a slow growth rate and the ability to survive extreme temperatures."
