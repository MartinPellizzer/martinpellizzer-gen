    "intro": "Ephemerantha homoglossa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers and its unique ability to grow without soil, relying instead on symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, swampy habitat. It blooms briefly during the summer months, making it a challenging subject for botanists and enthusiasts alike. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
