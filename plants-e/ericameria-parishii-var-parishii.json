    "intro": "Ericameria parishii var. parishii, commonly known as the Paria greasewood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a low-growing habit. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Ericameria parishii var. parishii plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
