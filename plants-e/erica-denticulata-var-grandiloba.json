    "intro": "Erica denticulata var. grandiloba, commonly known as the large-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or pale red, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a distinctive serrated edge. Erica denticulata var. grandiloba is well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, showing resilience to salt spray and strong winds."
