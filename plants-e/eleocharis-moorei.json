    "intro": "Eleocharis moorei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often inconspicuous, consisting of numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Eleocharis moorei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions."
