    "intro": "Eriogonum intrafractum, commonly known as the Sierra foothill buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as slopes and meadows. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum intrafractum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
