    "intro": "Elaeocarpus decandrus, commonly known as the white-flowered elaeocarpus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, fibrous shell. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
