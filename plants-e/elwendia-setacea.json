    "intro": "Elwendia setacea, commonly known as the woolly elwendia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Elwendia setacea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought-resistant qualities."
