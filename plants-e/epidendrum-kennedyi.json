    "intro": "Epidendrum kennedyi, commonly known as the Kennedy's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Epidendrum kennedyi is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
