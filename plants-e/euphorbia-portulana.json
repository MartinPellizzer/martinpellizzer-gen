    "intro": "Euphorbia portulana, commonly known as the mouse-eared cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
