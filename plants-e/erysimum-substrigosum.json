    "intro": "Erysimum substrigosum, commonly known as the hairy wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Erysimum substrigosum is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
