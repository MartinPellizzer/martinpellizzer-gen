    "intro": "Encyclia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often dry or seasonal habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it produces showy, spurred flowers with a distinctive fringed appearance. Encyclia fimbriata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
