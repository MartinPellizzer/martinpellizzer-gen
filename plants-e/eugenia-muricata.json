    "intro": "Eugenia muricata, commonly known as the rough-shelled guava, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, spiny bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, aromatic fruits with a tart-sweet flavor. The fruit is typically round or oval, with a thick, leathery skin and a segmented interior containing numerous small, juicy seeds. Eugenia muricata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in home gardens."
