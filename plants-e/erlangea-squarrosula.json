    "intro": "Erlangea squarrosula, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its adaptations to drought include reduced leaf surface area and the ability to store water in its stems. Erlangea squarrosula is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments."
