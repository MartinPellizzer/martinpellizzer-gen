    "intro": "Eunanus mephiticus, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has a distinctive odor, often described as foul or pungent, which is believed to deter herbivores. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid environment. Eunanus mephiticus is often found growing near water bodies and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
