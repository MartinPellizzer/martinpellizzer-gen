    "intro": "Echeveria insularis, commonly known as the Rosy Red Echeveria, is a succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically pink to red in color, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Echeveria insularis is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
