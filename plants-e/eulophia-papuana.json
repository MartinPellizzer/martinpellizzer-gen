    "intro": "Eulophia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of New Guinea and nearby islands. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowering stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Eulophia papuana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
