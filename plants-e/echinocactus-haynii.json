It is characterized by its rounded, spiny, globular shape and is covered in dense, yellowish-green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant."
