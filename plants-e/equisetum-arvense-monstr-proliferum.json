    "intro": "Equisetum arvense monstr. proliferum, commonly known as field horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Equisetales. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the upper part of the stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. This species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both vegetative reproduction and spores."
