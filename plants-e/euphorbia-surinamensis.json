    "intro": "Euphorbia surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia surinamensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine."
