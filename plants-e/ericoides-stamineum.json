    "intro": "Ericoides stamineum, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ericoides stamineum is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped landscapes."
