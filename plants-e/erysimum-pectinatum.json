It is a herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant yellow flowers in early spring. The plant features pinnately lobed leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.
