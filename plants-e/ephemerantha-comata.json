    "intro": "Ephemerantha comata, commonly known as the silky evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Its seeds are encased in a tough, hairy capsule that aids in dispersal by wind or animals. The botanical features of Ephemerantha comata make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
