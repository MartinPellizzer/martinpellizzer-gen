    "intro": "Elaphoglossum atrorubens, commonly known as the dark red holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a typical feature of ferns. Elaphoglossum atrorubens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
