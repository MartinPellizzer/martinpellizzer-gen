It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender stems and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along riverbanks and in wet meadows. It has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.
