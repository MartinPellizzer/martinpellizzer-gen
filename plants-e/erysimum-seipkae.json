    "intro": "Erysimum seipkae, commonly known as the Seipka's wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine environments. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, a trait typical of the Brassicaceae family. Erysimum seipkae is often found in meadows and along rocky outcrops, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
