    "intro": "Elatine obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate waterwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, with four petals, and it produces small, bead-like fruits. Elatine obovata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, muddy substrates and is often found in temperate regions."
