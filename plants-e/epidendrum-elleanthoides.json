    "intro": "Epidendrum elleanthoides, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Epidendrum, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. The flowers are often white or pale pink, with a distinct three-lobed lip that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
