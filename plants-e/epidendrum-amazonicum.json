    "intro": "Epidendrum amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum amazonicum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth."
