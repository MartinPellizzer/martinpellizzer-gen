    "intro": "Eurycaulis, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming during the cooler months. Eurycaulis thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found growing along shorelines and dunes. Its fibrous leaves have been historically used by indigenous communities for making ropes and textiles."
