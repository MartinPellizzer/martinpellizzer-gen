    "intro": "Eustegia fraterna, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its showy, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Eustegia fraterna is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in indigenous communities."
