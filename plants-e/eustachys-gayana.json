    "intro": "Eustachys gayana, commonly known as giant pampas grass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, fibrous stalks and large, feathery plumes that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes allow it to form dense clumps. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
