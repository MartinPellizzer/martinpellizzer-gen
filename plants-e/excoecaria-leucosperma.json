    "intro": "Excoecaria leucosperma, commonly known as the white-fruited croton, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into distinctive, fleshy, white berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
