    "intro": "Eurya yungasiae, commonly known as the Yungas Eurya, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the humid forests of the Yungas region in northern South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its restricted habitat, Eurya yungasiae is considered a rare and endangered species."
