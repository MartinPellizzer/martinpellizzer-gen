    "intro": "Eriogonum hemipterum var. griseum, commonly known as the grayleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a low-growing, mat-like form with numerous branched stems. The leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive, waxy appearance that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
