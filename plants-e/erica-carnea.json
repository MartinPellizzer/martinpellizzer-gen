    "intro": "Erica carnea, commonly known as the evergreen heath, is a flowering plant native to the western Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces pink, white, or red blooms from late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica carnea thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, and it is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Its ability to form dense mats makes it an effective ground cover in difficult gardening conditions."
