    "intro": "Emerus fruticosus, commonly known as the common thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and wastelands. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. The plant contains toxic compounds and has been used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
