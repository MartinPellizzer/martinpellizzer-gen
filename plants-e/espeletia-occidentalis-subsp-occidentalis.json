    "intro": "Espeletia occidentalis subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and woolly, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, violet or purple inflorescences that bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It is adapted to high-altitude conditions, often growing in rocky or volcanic soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
