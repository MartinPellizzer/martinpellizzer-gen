    "intro": "Equisetum reptans var. variegatum, commonly known as the variable horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct variegation in its foliage. This plant is a perennial herbaceous species belonging to the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and spore-producing structures. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. The leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are segmented and jointed, typical of horsetails. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in wetland and woodland ecosystems."
