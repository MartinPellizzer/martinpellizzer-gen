    "intro": "Euphorbia nyikae var. nyikae, commonly known as the Nyika euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Nyika Plateau in Malawi. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
