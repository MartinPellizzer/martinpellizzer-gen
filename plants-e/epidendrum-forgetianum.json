    "intro": "Epidendrum forgetianum, commonly known as the Golden Cane Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum forgetianum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
