    "intro": "Euphorbia lecheoides, commonly known as the white-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with smooth, pale green bark and spiny, triangular-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia lecheoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
