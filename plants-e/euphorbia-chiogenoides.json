    "intro": "Euphorbia chiogenoides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Euphorbia chiogenoides is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
