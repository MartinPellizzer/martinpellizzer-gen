    "intro": "Echinocereus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with ribbed stems and spines that are often whitish or pale blue. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, typically at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Echinocereus leucanthus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
