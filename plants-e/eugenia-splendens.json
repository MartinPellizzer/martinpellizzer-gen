It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the wet season. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree. The fruit, which is edible, is small and turns from green to yellow as it ripens."
