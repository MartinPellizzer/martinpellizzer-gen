    "intro": "Eruca aspera, commonly known as the wild mustard or winter cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in gardens. The plant has alternate, toothed leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds, allowing for easy propagation. Eruca aspera is often considered a weed but can be used in some traditional herbal remedies."
