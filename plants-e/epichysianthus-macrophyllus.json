    "intro": "Epichysianthus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant leaf orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, giving it its scientific name \"macrophyllus,\" meaning \"large leaf.\" Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, sweet fragrance, attracting various pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
