It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming low, rounded mounds. Its leaves are typically green and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
