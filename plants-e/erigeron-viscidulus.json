It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Erigeron viscidulus is often found in open fields, disturbed areas, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
