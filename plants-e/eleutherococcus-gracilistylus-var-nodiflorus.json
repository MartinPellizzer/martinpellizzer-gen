    "intro": "Eleutherococcus gracilistylus var. nodiflorus, commonly known as the nodiflorous arrowwood, is a rare and relict species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other rare flora. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with prominent veins. The species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche."
