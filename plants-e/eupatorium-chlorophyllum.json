    "intro": "Eupatorium chlorophyllum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Eupatorium chlorophyllum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
