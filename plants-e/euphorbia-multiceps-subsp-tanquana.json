    "intro": "Euphorbia multiceps subsp. tanquana, commonly known as the Tanquana euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by specialized leaves. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
