    "intro": "Erianthus tristachyus, commonly known as the desert grass or African grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy soils. Erianthus tristachyus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to prevent soil erosion."
