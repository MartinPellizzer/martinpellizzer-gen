    "intro": "Euphorbia halophila var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to thrive in saline soils, making it a halophyte, or salt-tolerant plant. Due to its unique appearance and drought resistance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
