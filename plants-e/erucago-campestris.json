    "intro": "Erucago campestris, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that contain numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, with some parts used traditionally in herbal remedies."
