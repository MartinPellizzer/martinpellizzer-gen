    "intro": "Epidendrum nanosimplex, commonly known as the miniature epidendrum, is a compact orchid species native to Central and South America. It features small, linear leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often arranged in a spike. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
