    "intro": "Escobaria boregui, commonly known as the Boregui\u2019s liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its low, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features dense clusters of fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its small, white to pale green flowers appear in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Escobaria boregui is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
