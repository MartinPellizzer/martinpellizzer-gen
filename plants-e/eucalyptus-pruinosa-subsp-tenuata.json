    "intro": "Eucalyptus pruinosa subsp. tenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal creamy-white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is also noted for its aromatic oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
