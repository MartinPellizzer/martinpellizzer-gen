    "intro": "Euphorbia salicifolia var. legetima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, often gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It has a succulent stem that can store water, making it drought-tolerant. While it is ornamental in gardens, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
