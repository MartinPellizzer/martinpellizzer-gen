It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikes of small, pale brown flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Eleocharis crassiculmis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
