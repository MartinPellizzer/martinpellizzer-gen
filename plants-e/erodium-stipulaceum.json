The plant features slender stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to purple in color and appear in clusters, blooming from spring to early summer. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
