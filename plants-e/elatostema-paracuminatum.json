    "intro": "Elatostema paracuminatum, commonly known as the sweetleaf or sourgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettle species, and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically has small, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Elatostema paracuminatum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
