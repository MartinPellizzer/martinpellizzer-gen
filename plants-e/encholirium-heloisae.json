    "intro": "Encholirium heloisae, commonly known as the Mexican bird of paradise, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Mexico and is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that resembles a bird's beak. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, supporting its role as a bromeliad. Its flowers are typically red or orange, with a long, tubular shape that attracts specific pollinators. Encholirium heloisae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
