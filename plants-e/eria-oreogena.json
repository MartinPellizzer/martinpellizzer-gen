    "intro": "Eria oreogena, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it has adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil, and its flowers often display vivid colors to attract pollinators. Eria oreogena plays an important ecological role in its habitat, contributing to biodiversity and supporting local insect populations."
