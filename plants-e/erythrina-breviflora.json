    "intro": "Erythrina breviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with three to seven leaflets, and its bark is often smooth with a reddish or brownish hue. Erythrina breviflora is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules containing Rhizobium bacteria. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
