    "intro": "Erysimum quadrangulum, commonly known as the four-angled wallflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste places. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Erysimum quadrangulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
