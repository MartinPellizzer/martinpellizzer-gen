    "intro": "Elaterium heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable elaterium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, which are usually pale yellow or greenish-white in color. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Elaterium heterophyllum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
