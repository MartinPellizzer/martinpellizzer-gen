    "intro": "Echinopsis micropetala, commonly known as the small-petaled cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly during rare rainfall events. Echinopsis micropetala is a hardy plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
