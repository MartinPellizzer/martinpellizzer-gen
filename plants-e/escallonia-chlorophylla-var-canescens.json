    "intro": "Escallonia chlorophylla var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf escallonia, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds."
