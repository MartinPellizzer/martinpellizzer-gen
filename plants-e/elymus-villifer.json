    "intro": "Elymus villifer, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soils in various environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Elymus villifer is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in preventing erosion."
