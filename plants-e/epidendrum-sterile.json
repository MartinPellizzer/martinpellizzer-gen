    "intro": "Epidendrum sterile, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of true roots. It is an epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces showy, often white or greenish, flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are usually elongated and can vary in shape depending on the species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected environments."
