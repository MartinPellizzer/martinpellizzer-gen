It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red when mature. Eugenia glanduliflora is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common invasive species in some regions."
