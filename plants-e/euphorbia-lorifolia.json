    "intro": "Euphorbia lorifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive rosette of thick, fleshy, and often blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
