It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and saline conditions. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow. Eucalyptus litorea is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
