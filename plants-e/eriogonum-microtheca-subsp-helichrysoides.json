    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca subsp. helichrysoides, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This subspecies is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
