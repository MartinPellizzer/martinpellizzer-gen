    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rwandense, commonly known as the Rwandan holly fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Rwanda. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a unique, kidney-shaped indusium. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Elaphoglossum rwandense is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
