    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum subsp. subaridum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is an important component of local ecosystems."
