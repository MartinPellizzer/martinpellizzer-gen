    "intro": "Elymus sibiricus var. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically less than 10 cm in length, which is a distinguishing feature of the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
