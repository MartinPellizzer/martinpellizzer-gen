    "intro": "Euryloma recurvata, commonly known as the curlyleaf lily, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, recurved leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Euryloma recurvata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to aquatic environments."
