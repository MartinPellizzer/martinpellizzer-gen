    "intro": "Eriocaulon bassacense, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as rice fields and marshes. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with tiny white flowers that emerge above the water surface. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like appearance and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Eriocaulon bassacense plays a role in maintaining water quality and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
