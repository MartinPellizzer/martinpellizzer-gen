    "intro": "Epilobium obcordatum var. laxum, commonly known as the lax flowered willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lanceolate with a hairy surface. Its flowers are showy, with pink to reddish petals, and are arranged in spikes at the ends of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its more lax inflorescence compared to the typical variety of Epilobium obcordatum."
