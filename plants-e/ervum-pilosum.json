    "intro": "Ervum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Ervum pilosum is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable plant in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
