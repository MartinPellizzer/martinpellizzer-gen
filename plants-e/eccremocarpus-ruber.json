    "intro": "Eccremocarpus ruber, commonly known as the red flame vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a velvety texture with a deep green color. The fruit is a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release its seeds when mature."
