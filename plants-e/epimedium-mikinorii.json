    "intro": "Epimedium mikinorii, commonly known as the Japanese barbatan, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of lanceolate to ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Epimedium mikinorii thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense ground cover and its resilience to shade and cold temperatures."
