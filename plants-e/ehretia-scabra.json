    "intro": "Ehretia scabra, commonly known as the rough-leafed ehretia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually rough or pubescent on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ehretia scabra is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
