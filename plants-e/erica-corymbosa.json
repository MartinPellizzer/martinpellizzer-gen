    "intro": "Erica corymbosa, commonly known as the Heath or Heathflower, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family, Ericaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica corymbosa is evergreen, with dense, leathery foliage that provides year-round structure. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in acidic, nutrient-poor conditions."
