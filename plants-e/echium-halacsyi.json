    "intro": "Echium halacsyi, commonly known as the Armenian viper's bugloss, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
