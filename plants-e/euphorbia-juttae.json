    "intro": "Euphorbia juttae, commonly known as the Jutta's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the rocky areas of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
