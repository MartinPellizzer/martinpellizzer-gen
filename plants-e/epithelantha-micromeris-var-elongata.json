    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed liveforever, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically elongated compared to the standard variety. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
