    "intro": "Epipogium kassnerianum, commonly known as the Kassner's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which are essential for its survival. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
