    "intro": "Elymus pungens subsp. pycnanthus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and small, spikelet-based flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
