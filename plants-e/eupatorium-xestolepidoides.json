    "intro": "Eupatorium xestolepidoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
