    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. leopolensis, commonly known as the Carpathian sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Carpathian region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown, with narrow, linear leaves. It is well adapted to harsh environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. This variety plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
