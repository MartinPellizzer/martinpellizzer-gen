    "intro": "Euphorbia polycarpa var. mejamia, commonly known as the Mejamia euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that help store water, adapting to its dry environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a compact form that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution to avoid skin irritation."
