    "intro": "Euphorbia trapifolia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant contains milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
