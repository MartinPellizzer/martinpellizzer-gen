    "intro": "Epiphyllum platycarpum, commonly known as the moon cactus or night bloomer, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often brightly colored and covered in small, pointed spines. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in shaded, humid environments. It produces fragrant, nocturnal flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming at night. The plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care."
