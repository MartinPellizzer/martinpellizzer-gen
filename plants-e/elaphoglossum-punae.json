It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in high-altitude environments such as the Puna grasslands. The plant is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. Elaphoglossum punae thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
