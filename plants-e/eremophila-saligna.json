    "intro": "Eremophila saligna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Eremophila saligna is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
