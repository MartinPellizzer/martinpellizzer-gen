    "intro": "Eriosema lobophyllum, commonly known as the woolly eriosema, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in grassland or rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
