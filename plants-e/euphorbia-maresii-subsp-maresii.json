    "intro": "Euphorbia maresii subsp. maresii, commonly known as the Maresii spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, upright stem with a distinctive greenish-yellow color and a spiny texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
