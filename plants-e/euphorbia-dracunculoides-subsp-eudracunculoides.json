    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides subsp. eudracunculoides, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation."
