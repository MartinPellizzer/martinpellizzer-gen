    "intro": "Euphorbia aprica, commonly known as the early euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its stems are often armed with small, sharp spines, a characteristic feature of many euphorbias. Euphorbia aprica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
