    "intro": "Eriocaulon carsonii subsp. euloense, commonly known as the Eulo Eriocaulon, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a compact rosette structure that helps it anchor in soft substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
