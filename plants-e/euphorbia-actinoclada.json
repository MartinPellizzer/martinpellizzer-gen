    "intro": "Euphorbia actinoclada, commonly known as the star spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick, branched stem covered in small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
