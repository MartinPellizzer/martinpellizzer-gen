    "intro": "Epidendrum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces striking, pendulous flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil, and it requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Epidendrum cuneatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
