It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, reddish-brown berries. Its leaves contain alkaloids, including cocaine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine and cultural practices. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils."
