    "intro": "Elaeocarpus octopetalus subsp. darnaedii, commonly known as the Darnaeedii elaeocarpus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of the genus Elaeocarpus. This subspecies is often found in lowland to montane rainforests, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
