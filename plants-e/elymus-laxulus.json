    "intro": "Elymus laxulus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Elymus laxulus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
