    "intro": "Erythroxylum nitidum var. glaucum, commonly known as the blue-hair coca, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces elliptical, blue-black berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and have psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids. This variety is distinguished by its glaucous (waxy, bluish) coating on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment."
