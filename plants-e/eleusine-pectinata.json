    "intro": "Eleusine pectinata, commonly known as silky finger grass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along waterways. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Eleusine pectinata is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in some regions."
