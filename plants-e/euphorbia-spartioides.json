    "intro": "Euphorbia spartioides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
