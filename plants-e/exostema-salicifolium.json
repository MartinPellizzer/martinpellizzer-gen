    "intro": "Exostema salicifolium, commonly known as the silky mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that resemble those of willow trees. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its stems are typically erect and can grow up to several feet in height, making it a notable presence in wetland habitats. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
