    "intro": "Eucomis robusta, commonly known as the torch lily, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiky flower spikes that resemble a torch, which bloom in shades of white, yellow, or orange. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. Eucomis robusta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements make it a favored ornamental plant in many gardens."
