    "intro": "Epiamomum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Amazon, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its striking purple and pink flowers bloom above the water. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it stay afloat and absorb nutrients from the water. Epiamomum is adapted to thrive in still or slow-moving waters with high organic content. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in Amazonian ecosystems."
