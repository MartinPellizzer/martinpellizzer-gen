    "intro": "Euphorbia limpopoana, commonly known as the Limpopo spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation."
