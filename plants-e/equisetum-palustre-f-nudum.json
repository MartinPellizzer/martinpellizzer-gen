    "intro": "Equisetum palustre f. nudum, commonly known as the naked marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. This fern-like plant thrives in wet, muddy environments such as marshes and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores. The plant's botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
