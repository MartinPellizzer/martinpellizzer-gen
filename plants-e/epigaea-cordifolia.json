    "intro": "Epigaea cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf trailing arbutus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a reddish underside. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves fully emerge. Its stems are prostrate, often forming dense mats on the forest floor, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Epigaea cordifolia is an important species in ecological studies due to its role in forest understory ecosystems."
