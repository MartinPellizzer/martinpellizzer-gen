    "intro": "Echinocodon lobophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
