    "intro": "Equilabium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy labellum orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features a slender, upright stem that bears several lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, hairy labellum that sets it apart from other orchid species. Its flowers are typically arranged in a raceme and bloom during the late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
