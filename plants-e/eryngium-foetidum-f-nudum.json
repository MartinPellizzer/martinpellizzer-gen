    "intro": "Eryngium foetidum f. nudum, commonly known as \"culantro,\" is a variant of the plant Eryngium foetidum, which is native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are often used as a culinary herb in various cuisines, particularly in Latin American and Caribbean cooking. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color and are borne in dense, spiny clusters. The f. nudum form is notable for its reduced or absent bracts, giving it a more open appearance compared to the typical form of the species."
