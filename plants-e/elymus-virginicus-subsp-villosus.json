    "intro": "Elymus virginicus subsp. villosus, commonly known as hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster of blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
