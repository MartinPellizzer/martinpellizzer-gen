    "intro": "Euphorbia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower at the end of each stem, which is surrounded by specialized bracts that resemble petals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Euphorbia uniflora is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine."
