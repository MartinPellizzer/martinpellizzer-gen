    "intro": "Eriophorum scheuchzeri var. scheuchzeri, commonly known as the Alpine cottongrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in alpine tundra or mountain meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to cold and harsh environments. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
