It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and unique floral structures."
