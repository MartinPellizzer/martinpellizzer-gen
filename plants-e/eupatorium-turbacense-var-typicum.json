It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features tall, slender stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. This species is known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
