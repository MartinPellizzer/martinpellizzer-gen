It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
