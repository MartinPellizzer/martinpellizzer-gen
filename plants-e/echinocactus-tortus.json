    "intro": "Echinocactus tortus, commonly known as the twisted hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are densely covered with sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Echinocactus tortus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight."
