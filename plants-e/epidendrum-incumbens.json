    "intro": "Epidendrum incumbens, commonly known as the hanging epidendrum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly beautiful, long, pendant-like inflorescences with vibrant, often red or orange flowers. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Epidendrum incumbens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
