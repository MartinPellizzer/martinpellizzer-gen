    "intro": "Erodium malacoides var. tibesticum, commonly known as the Tibetan erodium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climatic conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, leathery pods that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
