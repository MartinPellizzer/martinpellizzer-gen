    "intro": "Eulophidium megistophyllum, commonly known as the giant leafy liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and possesses small, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and vascular tissues, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil surfaces. Eulophidium megistophyllum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
