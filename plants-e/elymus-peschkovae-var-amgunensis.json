    "intro": "Elymus peschkovae var. amgunensis, commonly known as the Amgun grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert habitats. This variant is notable for its ecological resilience and potential use in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
