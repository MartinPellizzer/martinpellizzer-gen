    "intro": "Epipactis levantina, commonly known as the Levant helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a striking inflorescence of purple to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It produces a single, erect stem that bears numerous flowers with a distinctive lip. Epipactis levantina is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
