    "intro": "Euphorbia cheirolepioides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine. Euphorbia cheirolepioides thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
