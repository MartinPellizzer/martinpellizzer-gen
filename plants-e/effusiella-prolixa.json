    "intro": "Effusiella prolixa, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, adapting to fluctuating water levels. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often floating or submergent, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic conditions. Effusiella prolixa plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
