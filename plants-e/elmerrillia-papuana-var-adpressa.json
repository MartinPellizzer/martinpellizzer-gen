    "intro": "Elmerrillia papuana var. adpressa, commonly known as the Papuan dwarf elm, is a rare and unique variant of the elmerrillia papuana species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves compared to the typical form. The plant is native to the lowland rainforests of Papua, Indonesia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
