    "intro": "Eragrostis episcopulus, commonly known as bishop's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a robust rhizomatous system that aids in its spread. Bishop's grass is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
