    "intro": "Eucalyptus bicolor, commonly known as the white gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white or pale grey bark that peels in thin, fibrous layers. The plant typically grows as a medium to tall tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are arranged in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The tree is valued for its timber and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices and for its aromatic properties."
