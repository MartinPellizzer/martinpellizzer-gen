It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its stems. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
