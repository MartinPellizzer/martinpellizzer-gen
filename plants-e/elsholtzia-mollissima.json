It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
