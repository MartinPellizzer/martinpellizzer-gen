    "intro": "Encyclia sagrana, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces dark green, strap-like leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern. Encyclia sagrana thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
