    "intro": "Elephantopus arenosus, commonly known as sand elephantopus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy and disturbed soils effectively. The species is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability."
