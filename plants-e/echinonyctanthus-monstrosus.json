    "intro": "Echinonyctanthus monstrosus, commonly known as the monstrous echinonyctanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
