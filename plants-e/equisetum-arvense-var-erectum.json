    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. erectum, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in challenging environments make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
