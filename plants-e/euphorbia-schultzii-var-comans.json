    "intro": "Euphorbia schultzii var. comans, commonly known as the Schultze's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, shrub-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
