    "intro": "Eupatorium pseudofastigiatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive veined pattern, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium pseudofastigiatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
