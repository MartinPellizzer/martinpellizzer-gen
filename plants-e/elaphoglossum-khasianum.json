    "intro": "Elaphoglossum khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and covered with fine hairs. The plant is native to the Himalayan regions, particularly in northeastern India, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum khasianum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for various organisms."
