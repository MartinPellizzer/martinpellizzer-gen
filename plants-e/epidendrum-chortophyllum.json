    "intro": "Epidendrum chortophyllum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It features striking, showy flowers with a deep pink color and a unique slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its role within its ecosystem and its ornamental value in horticulture."
