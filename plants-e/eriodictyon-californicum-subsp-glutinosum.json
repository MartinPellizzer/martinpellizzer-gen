It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that produce a sticky, soapy substance, which is the source of its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in coastal and inland areas of California. It has heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. This subspecies is notable for its medicinal properties and historical use by indigenous peoples."
