    "intro": "Eupatorium sessilifolium var. vaseyi, commonly known as the Vasey's boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats."
