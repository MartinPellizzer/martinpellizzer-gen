It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and steppe environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
