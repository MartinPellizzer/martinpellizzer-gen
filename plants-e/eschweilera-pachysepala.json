    "intro": "Eschweilera pachysepala, commonly known as the thick-ribbed evergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, reddish-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
