    "intro": "Eremophila maculata subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the spotted emu bush, is a shrub native to Australia. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, featuring grey-green foliage and tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for native pollinators. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
