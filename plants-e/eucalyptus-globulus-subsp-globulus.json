It is characterized by its smooth, blue-gray bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well-known for its essential oils, which are widely used in medicinal and industrial applications. This subspecies is also valued for its role in ecological systems and timber production."
