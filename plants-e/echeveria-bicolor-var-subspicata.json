    "intro": "Echeveria bicolor var. subspicata, commonly known as the Blue Jelly Plant, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to Mexico. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a subtle pink or purple hue along the edges. The plant produces vibrant pink or magenta flowers on tall, slender stems during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its coloration. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
