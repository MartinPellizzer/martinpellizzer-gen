    "intro": "Elaphoglossum carrascoense, commonly known as the Carrascoense holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant is native to the cloud forests of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Elaphoglossum carrascoense thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other epiphytic plants."
