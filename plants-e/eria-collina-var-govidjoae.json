    "intro": "Eria collina var. govidjoae, commonly known as the Goiwi orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
