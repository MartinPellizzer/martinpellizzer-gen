    "intro": "Ephedra somalensis, commonly known as the Somali ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Horn of Africa. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its stems contain alkaloids, including ephedrine, which have been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is also classified as a controlled substance in many countries."
