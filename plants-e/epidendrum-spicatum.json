    "intro": "Epidendrum spicatum, commonly known as the spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Epidendrum spicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a tropical or greenhouse environment."
