    "intro": "Eburnax pudica, commonly known as the delicate nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces smooth, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its nocturnal blooming habit, it plays a role in pollination by moths and other night-active insects."
