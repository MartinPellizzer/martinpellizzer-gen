    "intro": "Erodium rodiei, commonly known as the sticky weed or narrowleaf bedstraw, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is characterized by its small, sticky leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. Due to its adaptability, it can be invasive in some areas, though it also serves as a food source for certain pollinators."
