    "intro": "Erythrina warneckei, commonly known as the Warneckei coral tree, is a striking tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its sturdy, often branched stems are covered in small thorns. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release bright red, hairy seeds. Erythrina warneckei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a street tree in tropical regions."
