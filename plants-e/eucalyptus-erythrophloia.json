    "intro": "Eucalyptus erythrophloia, commonly known as the red-wooded eucalyptus, is a species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often red-barked trunk and pendulous, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular inflorescences with white or pink flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its aromatic oils are used in traditional medicine and as a natural remedy for respiratory conditions. The species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands."
