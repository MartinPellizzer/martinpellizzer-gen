It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and grasslands. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces dense clusters of spikelets along its branches. Its leaves are narrow and rough-textured, with a distinct bluish-green color. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
