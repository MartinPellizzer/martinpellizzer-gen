    "intro": "Euphorbia heterophylla f. hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairyleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
