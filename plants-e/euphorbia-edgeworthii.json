    "intro": "Euphorbia edgeworthii, commonly known as the Edgeworth's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
