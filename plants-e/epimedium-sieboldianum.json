It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, fern-like leaves that emerge in early spring. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Epimedium sieboldianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
