It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and elongated, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its complex hybrid origin and morphological variability."
