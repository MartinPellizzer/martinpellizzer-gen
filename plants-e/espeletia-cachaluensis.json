    "intro": "Espeletia cachaluensis, commonly known as the Cachal\u00fa or Cachal\u00fa flower, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its rosette-forming leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Espeletia cachaluensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
