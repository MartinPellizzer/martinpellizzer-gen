    "intro": "Erymophyllum, commonly known as the golden cupflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flowers that resemble small cups, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as prairies and open woodlands. Erymophyllum species are native to North America, particularly the central and western United States. These plants are often used in native plant gardens due to their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
