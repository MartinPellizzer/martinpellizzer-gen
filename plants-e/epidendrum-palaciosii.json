    "intro": "Epidendrum palaciosii, commonly known as the Palacios's orchid, is a species native to Mexico. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often arranged in racemes. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Epidendrum palaciosii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
