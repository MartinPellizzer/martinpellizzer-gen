    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum subsp. campanulatum, commonly known as the weeping horse-tail, is a perennial fern-like plant characterized by its slender, wiry stems and whorls of small, scale-like leaves. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically arranged in a drooping, bell-shaped cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in certain ecosystems."
