    "intro": "Entelea, commonly known as the \"giant water lily,\" is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are typically yellow and are enclosed within a spadix, a feature common in the Araceae family. Entelea species are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Their extensive root systems help stabilize sediments and improve water quality in their native environments."
