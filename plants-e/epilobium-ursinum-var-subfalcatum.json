    "intro": "Epilobium ursinum var. subfalcatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nitrogen-rich soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. It is part of the Onagraceae family, which includes other flowering plants with showy blooms. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Epilobium ursinum."
