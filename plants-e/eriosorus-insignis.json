    "intro": "Eriosorus insignis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous covering. Eriosorus insignis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
