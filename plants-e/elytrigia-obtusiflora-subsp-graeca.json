    "intro": "Elytrigia obtusiflora subsp. graeca, commonly known as Greek rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
