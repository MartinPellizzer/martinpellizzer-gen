It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikelets. This variety is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
