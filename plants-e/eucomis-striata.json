    "intro": "Eucomis striata, commonly known as the \"pineapple lily,\" is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a tight cluster at the base. The plant produces a tall, flowering stalk topped with a cluster of spiky, pineapple-like bracts that are often brightly colored, ranging from white to pink or red. These bracts are not true flowers but serve to protect the small, tubular flowers that bloom inside them. Eucomis striata is well-suited for containers or garden beds, thriving in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
