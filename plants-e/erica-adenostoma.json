    "intro": "Erica adenostoma, commonly known as the coastal heath or coastal Erica, is a shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring and early summer. Erica adenostoma thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
