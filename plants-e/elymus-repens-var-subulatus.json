    "intro": "Elymus repens var. subulatus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to colonize degraded habitats."
