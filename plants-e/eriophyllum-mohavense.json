    "intro": "Eriophyllum mohavense, commonly known as Mohave gumplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small, fuzzy spheres. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sand dunes and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a yellowish color that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
