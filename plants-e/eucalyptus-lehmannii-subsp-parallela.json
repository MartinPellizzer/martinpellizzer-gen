    "intro": "Eucalyptus lehmannii subsp. parallela, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color and have a rough, fibrous texture. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
