    "intro": "Erica viscida, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, showy flowers. The plant is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal and sandy environments. Its sticky leaves, from which it gets its common name, help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erica viscida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates."
