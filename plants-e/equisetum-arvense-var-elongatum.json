    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. elongatum, commonly known as the tall field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found near the ground level. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species."
