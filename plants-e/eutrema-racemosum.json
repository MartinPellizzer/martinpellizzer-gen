    "intro": "Eutrema racemosum, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline, sandy habitat. Its root system is adapted to tolerate saltwater and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species. Eutrema racemosum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
