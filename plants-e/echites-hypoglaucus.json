    "intro": "Echites hypoglaucus, commonly known as the smooth false dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are typically hairless and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
