    "intro": "Euphorbia heteropodum, commonly known as the \"Crown of Thorns,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem system with fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia heteropodum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
