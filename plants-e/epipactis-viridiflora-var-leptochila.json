It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche."
