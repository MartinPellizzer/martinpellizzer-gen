    "intro": "Eleocharis microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, ribbed leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female structures on separate spikelets, a common feature in the Cyperaceae family. Eleocharis microcarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
