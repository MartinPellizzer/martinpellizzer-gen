    "intro": "Emurtia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers. Emurtia is also known for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
