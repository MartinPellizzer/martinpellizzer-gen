    "intro": "Eugenia brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian guava or Brazilian cherry, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Eugenia brasiliana is also valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils."
