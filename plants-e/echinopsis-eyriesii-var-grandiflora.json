    "intro": "Echinopsis eyriesii var. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often adorned with spines and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for arid garden environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative and ornamental plant."
