    "intro": "Elatostema subcoriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and ecological niche."
