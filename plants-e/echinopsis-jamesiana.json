    "intro": "Echinopsis jamesiana, commonly known as the James's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a spiny exterior, which helps protect it from herbivores and excessive moisture loss. Its roots are adapted to absorb water efficiently during rare rainfall events. Echinopsis jamesiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
