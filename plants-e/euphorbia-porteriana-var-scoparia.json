    "intro": "Euphorbia porteriana var. scoparia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This species is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
