It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
