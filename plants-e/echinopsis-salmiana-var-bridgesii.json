    "intro": "Echinopsis salmiana var. bridgesii, commonly known as the Salmiana cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces striking white or pale purple flowers during the night, a trait typical of many nocturnal blooming cacti. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
