    "intro": "Elaphoglossum obscurum, commonly known as the dark fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are often smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Elaphoglossum obscurum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
