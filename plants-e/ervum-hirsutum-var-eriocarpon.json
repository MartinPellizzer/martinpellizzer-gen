It features compound leaves with small, hairy stipules and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a robust root system and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in hairy, inflated pods, which aid in seed dispersal. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
