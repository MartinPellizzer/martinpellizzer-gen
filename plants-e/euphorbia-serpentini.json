    "intro": "Euphorbia serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's tail, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, contributing to its unique appearance. Euphorbia serpentini is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
