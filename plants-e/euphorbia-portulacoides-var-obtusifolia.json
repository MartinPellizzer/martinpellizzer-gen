    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick, and often ribbed leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
