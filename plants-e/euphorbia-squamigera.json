    "intro": "Euphorbia squamigera, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating that covers its stems and leaves, providing a protective adaptation against intense sunlight and drought. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
