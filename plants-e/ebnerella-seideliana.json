    "intro": "Ebnerella seideliana, commonly known as the Seidel's cypress, is a rare and endangered coniferous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged along its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying conifer evolution in tropical environments."
