    "intro": "Euphorbia phyllanthoides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
