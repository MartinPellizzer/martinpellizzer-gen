    "intro": "Elymus brachytrichus, commonly known as the short-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Elymus brachytrichus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
