    "intro": "Eremitis robusta, commonly known as the robust stonecrop, is a hardy succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
