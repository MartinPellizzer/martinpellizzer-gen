    "intro": "Epilobium denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant produces showy pink to red flowers in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped with finely serrated edges, and the stems are often reddish in color. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
