    "intro": "Esenbeckia yaaxhokob, commonly known as the Yaaxhokob tree, is a rare and native plant found in specific regions of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, orange-red fruits containing several seeds. Esenbeckia yaaxhokob has adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
