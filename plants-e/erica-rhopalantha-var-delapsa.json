It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in winter and spring. The plant has leathery, needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This hardy plant is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
