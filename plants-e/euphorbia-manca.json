    "intro": "Euphorbia manca, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, branched stem covered in a thick layer of white, waxy sap that exudes when damaged. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cylindrical structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. Euphorbia manca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
