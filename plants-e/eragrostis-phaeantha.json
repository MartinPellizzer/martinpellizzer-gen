    "intro": "Eragrostis phaeantha, commonly known as the blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and native plant gardens. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Eragrostis phaeantha is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
