    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum var. album, commonly known as white crowfoot, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces tiny, black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems."
