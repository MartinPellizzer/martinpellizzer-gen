    "intro": "Eria pubescens, commonly known as the hairy eria, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eria pubescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
