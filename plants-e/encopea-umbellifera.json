    "intro": "Encopea umbellifera, commonly known as the umbrella fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble an umbrella, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Encopea umbellifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth."
