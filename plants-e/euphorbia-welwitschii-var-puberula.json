    "intro": "Euphorbia welwitschii var. puberula, commonly known as the Welwitsch's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and a spiny, branched structure that helps it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
