These plants are native to various regions of the Americas and are characterized by their grass-like appearance and small, showy flowers. The flowers typically have three petals and are often blue or purple in color, giving the plant its common name. Ellobium species are generally found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in their native environments."
