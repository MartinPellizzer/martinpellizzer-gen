    "intro": "Ecbolium hemsleyanum, commonly known as the Hemsley's ecbolium, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often spirally twisted leaves, which are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with four petals and prominent stamens. It thrives in arid environments, often found in rocky or limestone soils, and is native to parts of Mexico and Central America. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
