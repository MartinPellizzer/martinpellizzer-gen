It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small yellow to orange composite flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
