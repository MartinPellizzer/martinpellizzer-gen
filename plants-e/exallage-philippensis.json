    "intro": "Exallage philippensis, commonly known as the Philippine sand orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
