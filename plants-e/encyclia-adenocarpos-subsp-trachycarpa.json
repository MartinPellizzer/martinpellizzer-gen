    "intro": "Encyclia adenocarpos subsp. trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-leaved pineapple orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and long, strap-like leaves that are covered in a rough, fibrous texture. The plant produces fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
