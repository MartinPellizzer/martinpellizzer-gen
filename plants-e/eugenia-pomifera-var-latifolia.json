    "intro": "Eugenia pomifera var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf feijoa, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible, berry-like fruits. The fruit has a white, juicy pulp with a sweet and tangy flavor, often compared to a cross between a strawberry and a pineapple. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit."
