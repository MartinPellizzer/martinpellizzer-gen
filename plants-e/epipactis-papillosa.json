    "intro": "Epipactis papillosa, commonly known as the hairy helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a distinctive, showy flower with a greenish-yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Epipactis papillosa is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species."
