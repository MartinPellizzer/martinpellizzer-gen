    "intro": "Euphorbia rubra, commonly known as the red-spotted spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. Euphorbia rubra is a hardy plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
