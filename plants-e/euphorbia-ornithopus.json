    "intro": "Euphorbia ornithopus, commonly known as the bird's beak euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, spiny stem with a narrow, bird-like beak-shaped tip, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant is often cultivated for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
