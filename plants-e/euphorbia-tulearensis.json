    "intro": "Euphorbia tulearensis, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
