    "intro": "Elytrigia elongata subsp. salsa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common vegetation component in salt marshes and dunes. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green color, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Saltgrass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
