    "intro": "Electra mutica var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It features dense, compact foliage with small, bright yellow to golden-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, followed by small, three-lobed fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
