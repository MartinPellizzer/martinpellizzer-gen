    "intro": "Erythronium revolutum, commonly known as the rolled-leaf fritillary, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often reddish in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
