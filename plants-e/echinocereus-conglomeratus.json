    "intro": "Echinocereus conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent cactus characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical stems, which are often covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
