    "intro": "Ephemerantha trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched ephemeral, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom briefly during the warm months. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Due to its short blooming period and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
