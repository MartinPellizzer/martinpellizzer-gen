    "intro": "Echinocactus hexaedrophorus var. major, commonly known as the Mexican lion's tail, is a species of cactus native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and large, spiny, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on long, slender stems. It is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and collections."
