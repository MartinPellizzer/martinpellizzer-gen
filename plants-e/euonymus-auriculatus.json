    "intro": "Euonymus auriculatus, commonly known as the bear's ear plant, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ear-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Euonymus auriculatus is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil types and its low maintenance requirements."
