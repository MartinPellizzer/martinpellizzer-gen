    "intro": "Eusteralis myosuroides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is native to regions of Africa and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many areas."
