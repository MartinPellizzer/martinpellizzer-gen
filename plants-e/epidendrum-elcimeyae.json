    "intro": "Epidendrum elcimeyae, commonly known as the Elcimeyae Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Epidendrum elcimeyae is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
