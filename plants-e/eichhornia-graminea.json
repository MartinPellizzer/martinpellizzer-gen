    "intro": "Eichhornia graminea, commonly known as water hyacinth, is an aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy purple flowers, which bloom throughout the year. The plant has a rapid growth rate, often leading to dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and can absorb nutrients from the water, making it both a nuisance and a potential bioindicator. Eichhornia graminea is widely used in phytoremediation due to its ability to remove pollutants from water."
