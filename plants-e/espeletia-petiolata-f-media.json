    "intro": "Espeletia petiolata f. media, commonly known as the \"Potosi plant,\" is a striking rosette-forming plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in its arid environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its growth habit and floral structure are characteristic of the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. Espeletia petiolata f. media is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with ample sunlight."
