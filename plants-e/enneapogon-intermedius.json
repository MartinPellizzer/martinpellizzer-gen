    "intro": "Enneapogon intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh climates. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas."
