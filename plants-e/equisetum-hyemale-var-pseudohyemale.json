    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. pseudohyemale, commonly known as the false scott's willow, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and spore-producing cones. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it reproduces primarily through spores rather than seeds. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
