    "intro": "Euphrasia repens, commonly known as the running eyebright, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white\u8338\u6bdb, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Euphrasia repens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows."
