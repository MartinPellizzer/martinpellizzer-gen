It features large, broad leaves that are typically lance-shaped or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Elaterium macrophyllum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
