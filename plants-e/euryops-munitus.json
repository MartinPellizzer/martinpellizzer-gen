    "intro": "Euryops munitus, commonly known as the yellow coneflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets, which are often mistaken for a single flower. Euryops munitus typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early autumn."
