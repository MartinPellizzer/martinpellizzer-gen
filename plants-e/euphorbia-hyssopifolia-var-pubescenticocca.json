    "intro": "Euphorbia hyssopifolia var. pubescenticocca, commonly known as the pubescent euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features erect, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive pubescent appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its succulent nature allows it to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments."
