    "intro": "Euphorbia serrata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flowers typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
