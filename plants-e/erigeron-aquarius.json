It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Erigeron aquarius is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability to waterlogged soils."
