    "intro": "Erodium chium var. longepetiolatum, commonly known as the long-petioled bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have hairy surfaces, while the flowers are small, pink or purple, and borne in clusters. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is distinguished by its elongated petioles, which set it apart from other varieties of Erodium chium."
