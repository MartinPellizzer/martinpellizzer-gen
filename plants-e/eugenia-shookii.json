    "intro": "Eugenia shookii, commonly known as the Shook's guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in taste to guavas, though they are typically smaller and more acidic. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Eugenia shookii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in tropical gardens."
