    "intro": "Echinops coriarius, commonly known as the spiked centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and produces blue or purple flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Echinops coriarius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
