It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that enclose numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species."
