    "intro": "Euphorbia bicolor var. concolor, commonly known as the white-spotted euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with green or reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
