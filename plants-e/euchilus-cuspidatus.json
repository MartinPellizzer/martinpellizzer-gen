    "intro": "Euchilus cuspidatus, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive, spiny leaves that provide a protective mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Euchilus cuspidatus is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
