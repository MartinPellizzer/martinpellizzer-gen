    "intro": "Eria puguahaanensis, commonly known as the Hainan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a unique floral structure typical of many orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria puguahaanensis is considered a conservation concern."
