    "intro": "Eleocharis helenae, commonly known as Helen's spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets, which are typically green to reddish in color. The plant grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water areas, and is often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure typical of the sedge family. Eleocharis helenae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
