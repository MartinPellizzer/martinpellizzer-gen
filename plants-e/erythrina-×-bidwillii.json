    "intro": "Erythrina \u00d7 bidwillii, commonly known as the flame tree, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Erythrina crista-galli and Erythrina indica, showcasing a blend of characteristics from both parent species. The plant is native to Australia and is known for its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in summer. Its compound leaves are palmately arranged, and the tree can grow up to 15 meters tall, making it a prominent feature in tropical and subtropical landscapes. The seeds are encased in a fibrous pod, which splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the wind."
