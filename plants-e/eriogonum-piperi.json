    "intro": "Eriogonum piperi, commonly known as the Townsend's sally, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, thriving in arid environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum piperi plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a symbol of the region's unique flora."
