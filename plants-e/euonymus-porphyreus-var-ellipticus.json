It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that exhibits a rich, dark green color with a glossy sheen. The leaves are elliptical in shape, often with slightly serrated edges, and they remain throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
