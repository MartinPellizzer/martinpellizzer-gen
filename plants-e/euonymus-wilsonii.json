    "intro": "Euonymus wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's spurge, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, inflated seed capsules. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Euonymus wilsonii is also valued for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
