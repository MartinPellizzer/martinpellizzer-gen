    "intro": "Eriosema capitatum, commonly known as the woolly-headed eriosema, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers a semi-shade to partial sun environment."
