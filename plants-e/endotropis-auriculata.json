It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs.

Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
