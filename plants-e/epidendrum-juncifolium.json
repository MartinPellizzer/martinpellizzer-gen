    "intro": "Epidendrum juncifolium, commonly known as the rush-leaf orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its natural habitat, though it can be challenging to cultivate outside of its native range."
