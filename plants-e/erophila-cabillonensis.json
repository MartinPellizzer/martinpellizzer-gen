    "intro": "Erophila cabillonensis, commonly known as the Cabillon Mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erophila cabillonensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
