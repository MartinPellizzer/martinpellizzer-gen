    "intro": "Encopella tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its resilience, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
