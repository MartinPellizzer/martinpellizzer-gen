    "intro": "Ervatamia corymbosa var. kelsallii, commonly known as the Kelsall's ervatamia, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in corymbs, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
