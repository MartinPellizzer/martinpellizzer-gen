    "intro": "Erythranthe rupestris, commonly known as the rock snapdragon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in open areas with full sun exposure. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erythranthe rupestris is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
