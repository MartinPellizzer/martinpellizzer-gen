    "intro": "Equisetum philippii, commonly known as the Philippi's horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are used for reproduction. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like projections, and it lacks true leaves and roots. Equisetum philippii is also notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica."
