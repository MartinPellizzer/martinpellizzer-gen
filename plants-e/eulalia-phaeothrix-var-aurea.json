    "intro": "Eulalia phaeothrix var. aurea, commonly known as the golden pampas grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to South America. It features tall, upright stalks that produce feathery, golden-yellow plumes in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally blue-green in color, providing a nice contrast to the bright plumes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its unique appearance and seasonal color make it a standout in both residential and commercial settings."
