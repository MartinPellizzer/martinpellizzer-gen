    "intro": "Encephalartos fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, dry climate. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
