    "intro": "Englerocharis cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several small, white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
