    "intro": "Echinocereus nivosus, commonly known as the snow hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
