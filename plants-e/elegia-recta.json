It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is often found in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and pond edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions. Elegia recta is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
