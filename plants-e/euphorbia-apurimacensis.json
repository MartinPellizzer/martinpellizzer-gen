    "intro": "Euphorbia apurimacensis, commonly known as the Apurimac euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the high Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
