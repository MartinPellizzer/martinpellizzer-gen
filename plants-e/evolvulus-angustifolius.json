    "intro": "Evolvulus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, heart-shaped leaves and small, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
