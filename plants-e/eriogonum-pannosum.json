    "intro": "Eriogonum pannosum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as deserts and grasslands. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum pannosum is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
