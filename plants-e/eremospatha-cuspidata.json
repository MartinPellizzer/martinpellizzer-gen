It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, compound leaves with spiny tips, and small, pod-like fruits. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.
