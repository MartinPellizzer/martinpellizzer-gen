    "intro": "Epidendrum bicornutum, commonly known as the two-horned epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red with contrasting yellow lips. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. Epidendrum bicornutum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
