It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species. Euchresta trifoliolata is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, and it serves as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
