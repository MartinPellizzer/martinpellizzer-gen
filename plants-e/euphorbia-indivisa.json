    "intro": "Euphorbia indivisa, commonly known as the naked stem euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with a tall, unbranched stem that is covered in small, green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
