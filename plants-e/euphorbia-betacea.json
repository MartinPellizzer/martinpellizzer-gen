    "intro": "Euphorbia betacea, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, yellowish-green stems that often branch out into a bushy form. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia betacea is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance."
