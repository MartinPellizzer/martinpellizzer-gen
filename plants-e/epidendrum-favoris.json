    "intro": "Epidendrum favoris, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Epidendrum favoris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
