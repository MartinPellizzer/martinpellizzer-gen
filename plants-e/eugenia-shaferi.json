    "intro": "Eugenia shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 6 feet, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Eugenia shaferi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
