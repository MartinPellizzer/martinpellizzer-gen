    "intro": "Euphorbia mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
