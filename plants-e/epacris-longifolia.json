    "intro": "Epacris longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Epacris longifolia is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
