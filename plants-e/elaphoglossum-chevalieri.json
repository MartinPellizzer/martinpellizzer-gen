    "intro": "Elaphoglossum chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum chevalieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
