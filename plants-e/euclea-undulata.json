    "intro": "Euclea undulata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating, zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, yellowish fruits. Euclea undulata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
