    "intro": "Euphorbia ussanguensis, commonly known as the Congo buttercup, is a succulent plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine by local communities. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Euphorbia ussanguensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
