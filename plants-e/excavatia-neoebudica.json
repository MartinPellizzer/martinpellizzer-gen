    "intro": "Excavatia neoebudica, commonly known as the Moonshade Fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features intricate, lace-like fronds that shimmer with a silvery sheen under moonlight, giving it its poetic name. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures are unique, producing tiny, spore-filled capsules that are dispersed by wind. Due to its habitat specificity and slow growth, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
