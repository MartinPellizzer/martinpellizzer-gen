It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
