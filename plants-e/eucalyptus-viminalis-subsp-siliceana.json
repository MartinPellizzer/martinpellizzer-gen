    "intro": "Eucalyptus viminalis subsp. siliceana, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery-white underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and temperate regions."
