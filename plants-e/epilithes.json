    "intro": "Epilithes, commonly known as rock lichens, are composite organisms consisting of a fungal partner and one or more photosynthetic partners, typically algae or cyanobacteria. They grow on the surfaces of rocks, especially in moist, shaded environments. Epilithes play a crucial role in weathering rock surfaces and contributing to soil formation. Their presence often indicates a stable, humid microclimate. These organisms are highly resilient and can thrive in extreme conditions, making them important indicators of environmental health."
