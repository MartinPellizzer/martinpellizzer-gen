    "intro": "Eragrostis compacta, commonly known as dwarf lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
