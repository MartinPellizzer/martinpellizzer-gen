    "intro": "Echinopsis pentlandii var. achatina, commonly known as the Queen of the Night, is a striking cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stem and large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Its unique blooming habit, occurring only at night, adds to its allure and ecological significance."
