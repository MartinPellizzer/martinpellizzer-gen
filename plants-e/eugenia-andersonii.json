    "intro": "Eugenia andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's clove, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
