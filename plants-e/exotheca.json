    "intro": "Exotheca, commonly known as the outer layer of a seed coat, is a specialized structure in certain plants, particularly in the family Fabaceae. It is composed primarily of a thick, lignified layer that provides mechanical protection to the developing seed. The exotheca plays a crucial role in preventing desiccation and mechanical damage during seed maturation. It is often associated with the development of the seed's outer integument. This layer can vary in thickness and composition depending on the species and environmental conditions."
