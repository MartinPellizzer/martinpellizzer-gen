    "intro": "Epilobium anagallidifolium f. zapalowiczii, commonly known as the Zapalowiczii form of the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its unique leaf morphology. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is typically found in specific alpine or subalpine habitats. The leaves are narrow and often have a distinct serration pattern compared to the typical species. This form is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
