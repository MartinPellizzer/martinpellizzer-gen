    "intro": "Eleusine japonica, commonly known as Japanese lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
