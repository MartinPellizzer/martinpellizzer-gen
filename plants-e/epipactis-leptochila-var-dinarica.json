    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila var. dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric epipactis, is a rare orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown spots. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and mountainous areas. It has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
