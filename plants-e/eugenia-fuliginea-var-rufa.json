It is characterized by its glossy, dark green to reddish-brown leaves that change color with the seasons. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to common guavas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage. The variety is also valued for its potential in agroforestry systems and as a source of medicinal compounds."
