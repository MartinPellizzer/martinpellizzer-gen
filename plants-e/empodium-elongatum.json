    "intro": "Empodium elongatum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit with dense, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Empodium elongatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its botanical features make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems."
