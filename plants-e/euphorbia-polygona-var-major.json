    "intro": "Euphorbia polygona var. major, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems and leaves. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
