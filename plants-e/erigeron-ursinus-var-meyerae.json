    "intro": "Erigeron ursinus var. meyerae, commonly known as the Mexican fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, yellow-centered flowers that bloom in the summer. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the typical form of Erigeron ursinus."
