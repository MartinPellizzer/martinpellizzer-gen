    "intro": "Euonymus micranthus, commonly known as the dwarf boxleaf euonymus, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, four-petaled yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. It is valued in horticulture for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscaping and as a ground cover."
