    "intro": "Ericameria ericoides var. pachylepis, commonly known as the silverleaf ericoid, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flower clusters in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand arid conditions. This variety is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
