    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. subverticillatum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches. It possesses a slender, jointed stem that is covered in small, scale-like structures, typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and its unique morphology."
