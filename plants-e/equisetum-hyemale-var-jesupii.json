    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. jesupii, commonly known as the Jesup's horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail, characterized by its slender, unbranched stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, alkaline soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are typically found near the soil surface. Its stems are hollow and jointed, with a distinctive rough texture that aids in water transport. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
