    "intro": "Eugenia uvalha, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Eugenia uvalha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
