    "intro": "Euonymus szechuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Euonymus szechuanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
