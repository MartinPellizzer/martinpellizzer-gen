    "intro": "Encyclia papilio, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a unique lip structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern to maximize light exposure. Encyclia papilio is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
