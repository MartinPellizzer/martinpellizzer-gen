    "intro": "Epigeneium stella-silvae, commonly known as the starwood vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, star-like white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along tree trunks and shrubs. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in tropical regions."
