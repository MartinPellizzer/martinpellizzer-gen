    "intro": "Espeletia schultzii var. subparamuna, commonly known as the Paramo espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its dense rosette of silver-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its cold, high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the paramo ecosystem. This species plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
