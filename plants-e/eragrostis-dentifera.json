    "intro": "Eragrostis dentifera, commonly known as the toothed bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow with distinct, tooth-like serrations along the edges. Eragrostis dentifera is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common species in prairie and woodland habitats."
