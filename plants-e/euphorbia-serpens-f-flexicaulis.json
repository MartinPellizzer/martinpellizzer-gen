    "intro": "Euphorbia serpens f. flexicaulis, commonly known as the curly euphorbia, is a succulent plant characterized by its unique, spiraling growth pattern. It features fleshy, green stems that curl tightly around themselves, forming a compact, spiral shape. The plant is native to arid regions of Africa and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It produces small, yellowish-green cyathia (modified flowers) that bloom in summer. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in rock gardens."
