    "intro": "Erica acutiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in regions with mild, Mediterranean climates. Erica acutiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
