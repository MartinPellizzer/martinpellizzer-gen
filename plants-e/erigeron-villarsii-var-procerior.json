    "intro": "Erigeron villarsii var. procerior, commonly known as the slender fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a showy display of white to pale yellow petals. The species is often found in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
