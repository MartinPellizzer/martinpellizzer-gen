    "intro": "Encephalartos dyeri, commonly known as Dyers cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of long, narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones being larger and more showy. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
