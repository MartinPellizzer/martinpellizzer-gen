    "intro": "[WRONG START] Elaeagnus longipes var. multiflora, commonly known as the Chinese silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and winter interest, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
