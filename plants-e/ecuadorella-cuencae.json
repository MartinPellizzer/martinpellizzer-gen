    "intro": "Ecuadorella cuencae, commonly known as the Cuenca ecuadorian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist climate. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrates it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
