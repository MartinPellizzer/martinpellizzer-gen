It is characterized by its distinctive spiny, globular flowers that resemble a sea urchin, hence its common name. The plant is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky shores, where it is often found in shallow tidal zones. Echinus stayneri plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
