    "intro": "Euphorbia erythradenia, commonly known as the red-veined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often red-veined and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens and rockeries."
