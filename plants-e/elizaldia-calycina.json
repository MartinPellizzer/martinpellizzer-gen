    "intro": "Elizaldia calycina, commonly known as the pink-flowered marsh plant, is a herbaceous species native to wetland environments in South America. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pink petals that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Elizaldia calycina is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies."
