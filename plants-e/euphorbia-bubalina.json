    "intro": "Euphorbia bubalina, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
