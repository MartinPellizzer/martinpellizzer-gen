    "intro": "Echinopsis nigripilis, commonly known as the black-haired echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its spiny, globular stems and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, white or yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is adapted to absorb water efficiently during rare rainfall events. Echinopsis nigripilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought."
