    "intro": "Encelia adenophora, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its hardy nature makes it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
