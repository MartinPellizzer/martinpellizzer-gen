    "intro": "Ephippiandra masoalensis, commonly known as the Masoalensis cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the biodiversity of Madagascar's flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
