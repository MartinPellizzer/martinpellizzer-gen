    "intro": "Eragrostis aurea, commonly known as golden beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its bright yellow inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eragrostis aurea is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions."
