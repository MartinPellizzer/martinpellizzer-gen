    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky appearance. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet, marshy environments, preferring moist soils and full sun. The plant features whorled leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive central stem that is segmented and covered in small, scale-like structures. It produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from cone-like structures called strobili at the top of the plant. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging wetland conditions."
