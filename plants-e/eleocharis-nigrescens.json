    "intro": "Eleocharis nigrescens, commonly known as black-stemmed spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in the Americas. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along streams, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, dark green stems that often turn reddish or blackish at maturity, giving it its common name. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Eleocharis nigrescens plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
