    "intro": "Euphorbia austriaca subsp. tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and shrubland habitats. Due to its succulent nature, it is somewhat drought-tolerant but requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
