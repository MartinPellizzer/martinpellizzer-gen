    "intro": "Eucalyptus drepanophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pink or white, which bloom during the cooler months. Its bark is rough and fibrous, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus drepanophylla is also valued for its aromatic oils and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
