    "intro": "Eulophia subsaprophytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pale green or brownish stems and its lack of visible leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, making it visually striking despite its subtle coloration. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
