    "intro": "Exitelia multiflora, commonly known as the purple-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
