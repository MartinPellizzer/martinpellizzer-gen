    "intro": "Eurybia hemispherica, commonly known as the spoonwort, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and tidal areas. The plant has slender, ascending stems that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. Eurybia hemispherica plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environments."
