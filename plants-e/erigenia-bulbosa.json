    "intro": "Erigenia bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous erigenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a loose cluster during the cooler months. Its underground bulb serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive droughts and regenerate in favorable conditions. Erigenia bulbosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
