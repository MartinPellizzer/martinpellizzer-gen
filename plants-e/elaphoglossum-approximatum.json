    "intro": "Elaphoglossum approximatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Elaphoglossum approximatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
