    "intro": "Eleocharis monticola var. pallida, commonly known as the pale sandspurry, is a species of sedge native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. It is often found in association with other aquatic and semi-aquatic plants."
