    "intro": "Eriogonum racemosum var. coccineum, commonly known as the redstem buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
