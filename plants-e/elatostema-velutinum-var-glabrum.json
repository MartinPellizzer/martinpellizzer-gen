    "intro": "Elatostema velutinum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface that distinguishes it from its varietal counterpart. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often subtended by bracts. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or swampy areas."
