It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Eriogonum vespinum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife."
