    "intro": "Eulophia stenoplectra, commonly known as the narrow-leafed eulophia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Eulophia stenoplectra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
