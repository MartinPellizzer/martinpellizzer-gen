    "intro": "Eleocharis sulcata var. grandirostris, commonly known as the broad-beak sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, while the inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. This variety is distinguished by its broad, elongated bracts that give it its common name."
