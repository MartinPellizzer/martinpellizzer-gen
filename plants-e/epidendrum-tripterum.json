    "intro": "Epidendrum tripterum, commonly known as the three-winged orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact, branching growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Epidendrum tripterum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
