It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating that covers its stems, providing insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a succulent, capable of storing water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
