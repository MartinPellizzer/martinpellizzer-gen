    "intro": "Equisetum funstonii f. caespitosum, commonly known as the Funston's horse-tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a trait common among ancient plant species. The plant's primitive structure and ecological role make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
