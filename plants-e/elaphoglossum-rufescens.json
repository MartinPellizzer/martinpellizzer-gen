    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in woodland habitats. The rufescens species name refers to the reddish coloration of its stems, which is more pronounced in younger plants."
