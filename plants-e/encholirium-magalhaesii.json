    "intro": "Encholirium magalhaesii, commonly known as the Magalh\u00e3es' lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is adapted to the cold, high-altitude environments where it grows. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces distinctive, spirally arranged bracts that enhance its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
