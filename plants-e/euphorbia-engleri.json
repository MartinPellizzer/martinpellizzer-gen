    "intro": "Euphorbia engleri, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia engleri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
