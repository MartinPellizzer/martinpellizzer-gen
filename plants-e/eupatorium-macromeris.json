    "intro": "Eupatorium macromeris, commonly known as the broad-leaved thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale blue florets arranged in composite flower clusters, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a distinct central vein. Eupatorium macromeris is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade."
