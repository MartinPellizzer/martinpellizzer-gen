    "intro": "Euphorbia heyneana var. scindica, commonly known as the Split-stem Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented stems that often split into multiple branches, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its striking form and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
