    "intro": "Elaphoglossum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a smooth, glabrous texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a linear pattern. Elaphoglossum glabratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
