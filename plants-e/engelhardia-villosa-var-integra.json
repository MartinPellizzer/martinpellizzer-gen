    "intro": "Engelhardia villosa var. integra, commonly known as the silky hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomland hardwood forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat conservation."
