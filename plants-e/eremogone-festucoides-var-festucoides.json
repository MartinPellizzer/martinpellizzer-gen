It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to arid environments, making it a common component of xerophytic vegetation."
