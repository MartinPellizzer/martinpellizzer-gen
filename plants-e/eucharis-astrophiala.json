    "intro": "Eucharis astrophiala, commonly known as the star-shaped nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-like flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers with a strong, fragrant scent, which attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Eucharis astrophiala is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
