    "intro": "Euphorbia anagalloides, commonly known as the \"spearthorn\" or \"devil's backbone,\" is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has a distinctive leafless appearance, with the leaves reduced to small, scale-like structures at the base of the stems. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Euphorbia anagalloides is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
