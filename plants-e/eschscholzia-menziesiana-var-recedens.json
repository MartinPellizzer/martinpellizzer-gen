    "intro": "Eschscholzia menziesiana var. recedens, commonly known as the coastal golden poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific coast of North America. It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, adapting to harsh, salty environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variety is closely related to the common California poppy and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
