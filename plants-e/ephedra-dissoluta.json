    "intro": "Ephedra dissoluta, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of China, Mongolia, and Russia. It is a shrub-like plant with distinctive, branched stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, including ephedrine, which have been used in traditional medicine. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
