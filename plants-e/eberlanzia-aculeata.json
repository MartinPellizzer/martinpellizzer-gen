    "intro": "Eberlanzia aculeata, commonly known as the thorned elder or spiky elder, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, stiff spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Eberlanzia aculeata is often found in dry forests and disturbed areas, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
