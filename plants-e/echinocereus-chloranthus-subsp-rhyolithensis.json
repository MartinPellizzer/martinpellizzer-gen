    "intro": "Echinocereus chloranthus subsp. rhyolithensis, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, ribbed stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is known for its resilience to drought and high temperatures, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
