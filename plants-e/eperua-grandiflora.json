    "intro": "Eperua grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered eperua, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia and parts of New Guinea. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy, pale yellow or cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are woody pods containing edible seeds, which are often used by Indigenous communities. Eperua grandiflora plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting biodiversity and contributing to forest structure."
