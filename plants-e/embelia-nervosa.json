    "intro": "[WRONG START] Embilia nervosa, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berry-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The fruits are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine for their antioxidant properties. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
