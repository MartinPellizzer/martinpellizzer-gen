    "intro": "Eutrema edwardsii var. intermedium, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophyte adapted to saline environments. It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water and reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, including salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the summer months. This variety is notable for its resilience to harsh coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
