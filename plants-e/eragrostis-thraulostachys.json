It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for dryland restoration projects. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for livestock and habitat for various insects and small animals."
