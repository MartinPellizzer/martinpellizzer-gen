    "intro": "Eriogonum pyrolifolium, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and open woodlands. Eriogonum pyrolifolium plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
