    "intro": "Eleocharis retroflexa subsp. subtilissima, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in shallow water or saturated soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is distinguished by its finely tapered spikelets and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
