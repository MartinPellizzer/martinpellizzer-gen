    "intro": "Euphorbia segetalis var. segetalis, commonly known as the field spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features erect, branching stems covered in a white powdery coating, known as a pruina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, often with a slight reddish hue. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
