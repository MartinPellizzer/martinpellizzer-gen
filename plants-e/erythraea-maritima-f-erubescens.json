    "intro": "Erythraea maritima f. erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered sea erythraea, is a rare coastal plant characterized by its distinctive red-pink flowers. It thrives in saline environments, typically found along rocky shores and tidal zones. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual contrast to the rugged coastal landscape. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to maritime conditions."
