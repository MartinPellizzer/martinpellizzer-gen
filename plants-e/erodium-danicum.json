    "intro": "Erodium danicum, commonly known as the common erodium, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in disturbed soils."
