    "intro": "Eurybia hygrophila, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is erect and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its most distinctive feature is its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eurybia hygrophila plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
