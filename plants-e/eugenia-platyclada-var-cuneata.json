It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple fruits resembling small berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The varietal form, cuneata, is distinguished by its broader leaf shape compared to the typical variety."
