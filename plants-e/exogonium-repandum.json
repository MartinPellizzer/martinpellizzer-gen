    "intro": "Exogonium repandum, commonly known as the wandering begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-like growth pattern, where new shoots emerge from the base of the plant, creating a cascading effect. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. Exogonium repandum is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
