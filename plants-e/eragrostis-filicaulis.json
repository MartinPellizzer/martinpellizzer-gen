    "intro": "Eragrostis filicaulis, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
