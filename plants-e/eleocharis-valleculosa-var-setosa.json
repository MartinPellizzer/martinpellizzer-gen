    "intro": "Eleocharis valleculosa var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
