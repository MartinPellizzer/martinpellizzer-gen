    "intro": "Erycina echinata, commonly known as the spiked erycina, is a tropical orchid native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, long, spiky inflorescence that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom sequentially along the spike. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Erycina echinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and private collections."
