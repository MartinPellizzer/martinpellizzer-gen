    "intro": "Epipactis palustris f. ericetorum, commonly known as the Ericaceous marsh helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wet, acidic habitats. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive leaf structure, featuring a broad, sword-shaped leaf that is often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with greenish-yellow flowers that have a unique, spurred lip. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and thrives in peat bogs and heathland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
