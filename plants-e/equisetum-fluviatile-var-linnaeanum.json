    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile var. linnaeanum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
