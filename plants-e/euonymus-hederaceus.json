    "intro": "Euonymus hederaceus, commonly known as the ivy-leaved dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that resemble ivy, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
