    "intro": "Erophila verna var. stricta, commonly known as the early bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on moist soils, often found in meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded or partially shaded conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
