    "intro": "Epilobium lineare f. simplex, commonly known as the simple willow herb, is a flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, tubular, and pinkish-red, arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. It is characterized by its simple, non-branched inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other forms of Epilobium."
