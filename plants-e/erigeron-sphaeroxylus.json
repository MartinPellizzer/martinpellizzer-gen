It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its spherical shape and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and ornamental species. Erigeron sphaeroxylus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
