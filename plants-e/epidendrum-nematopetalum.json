    "intro": "Epidendrum nematopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, often arranged in racemes. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to thrive on trees or in moist, shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
