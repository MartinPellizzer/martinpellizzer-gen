    "intro": "Epidendrum lanceola, commonly known as the lance leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum lanceola is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
