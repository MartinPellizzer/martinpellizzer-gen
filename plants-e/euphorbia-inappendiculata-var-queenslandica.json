    "intro": "Euphorbia inappendiculata var. queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland milk bush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its production of yellowish-green sap, which is toxic and can cause irritation. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
