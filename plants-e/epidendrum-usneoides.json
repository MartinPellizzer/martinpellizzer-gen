    "intro": "Epidendrum usneoides, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, tropical environments. It does not derive nutrients from its host but instead absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has long, hanging filaments that form dense, moss-like clusters on trees. Its leaves are narrow and spirally arranged, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers. Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing habitat for various organisms."
