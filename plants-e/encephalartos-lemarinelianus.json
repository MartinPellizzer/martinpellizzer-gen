    "intro": "Encephalartos lemarinelianus, commonly known as the Lamentable cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range."
