    "intro": "Evelyna cynarocephala, commonly known as the Jerusalem artichoke, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that resemble those of the sunflower, followed by edible tubers that are rich in inulin. These tubers are not only nutritious but also have a unique, nutty flavor. Evelyna cynarocephala is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its culinary uses."
