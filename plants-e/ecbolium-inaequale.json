    "intro": "Ecbolium inaequale, commonly known as the unequal ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical flowers. The plant features hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are typically pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ecbolium inaequale is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
