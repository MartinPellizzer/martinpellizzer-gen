    "intro": "Eupodium laeve, commonly known as the smooth eupodium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Eupodium laeve is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
