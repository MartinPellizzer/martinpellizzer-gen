    "intro": "Euphorbia theodosia, commonly known as the Theodore's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
