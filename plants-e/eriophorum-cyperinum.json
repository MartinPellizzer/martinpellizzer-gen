It is characterized by its fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, fens, and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Eriophorum cyperinum plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
