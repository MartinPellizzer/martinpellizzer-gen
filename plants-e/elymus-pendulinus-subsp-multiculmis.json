    "intro": "Elymus pendulinus subsp. multiculmis, commonly known as the nodding needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated, nodding inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense mats or clumps. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the seeds are small, with persistent glumes that aid in seed dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
