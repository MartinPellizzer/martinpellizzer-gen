    "intro": "Euphorbia grandicornis subsp. grandicornis, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and distinctive, spiky, horn-like structures that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a striking addition to arid landscapes."
