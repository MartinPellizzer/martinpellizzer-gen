    "intro": "Echinops prescottii, commonly known as the Prescott thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, globe-shaped heads of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Echinops prescottii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
