It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Epidendrum astetei is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
