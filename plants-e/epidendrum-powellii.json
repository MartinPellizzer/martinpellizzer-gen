    "intro": "Epidendrum powellii, commonly known as the Powell's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright, branching growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Epidendrum powellii is also known for its ability to bloom reliably under proper growing conditions."
