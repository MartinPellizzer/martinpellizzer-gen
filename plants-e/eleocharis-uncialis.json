    "intro": "Eleocharis uncialis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in Asia and Australia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Eleocharis uncialis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
