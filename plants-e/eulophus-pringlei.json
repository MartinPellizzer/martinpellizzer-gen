    "intro": "Eulophus pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's eulophus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Eulophidae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces tiny, elongated fruits that contain minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eulophus pringlei is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies."
