    "intro": "Erica xerophila, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, featuring small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Erica xerophila is valued for its resilience and is often used in landscaping for coastal and drought-prone areas."
