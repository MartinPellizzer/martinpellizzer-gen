    "intro": "Epidendrum urubambae, commonly known as the Urubamba Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. Epidendrum urubambae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
