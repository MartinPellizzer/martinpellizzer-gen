    "intro": "Elephantopus spicatus var. densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower elephantopus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variant is distinguished by its more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Elephantopus spicatus."
