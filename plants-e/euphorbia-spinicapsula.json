    "intro": "Euphorbia spinicapsula, commonly known as the spiny capsule euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous spiny, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its adaptations to arid environments include storing water in its leaves and stems, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia spinicapsula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
