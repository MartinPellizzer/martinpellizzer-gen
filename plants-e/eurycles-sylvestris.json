    "intro": "Eurycles sylvestris, commonly known as the forest euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe. It features upright stems covered in a dense layer of yellowish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, often with a central orange or red disc. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that aids in moisture retention. This species is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
