    "intro": "Ecbolium cuspidulatum, commonly known as the spiny bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its erect stem, pinnately divided leaves, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Ecbolium cuspidulatum is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
