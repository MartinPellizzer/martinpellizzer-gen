    "intro": "Endespermum retusum, commonly known as the smooth endosperm plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its smooth, elongated seeds and fibrous endosperm, which provides nourishment to the developing embryo. It typically grows as a shrub with simple, alternate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers. Due to its unique seed structure, it is of interest in botanical studies related to seed development and plant reproduction."
