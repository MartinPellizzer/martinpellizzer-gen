It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its spiny, globular stems that are covered in dense, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spiky, spherical fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
