    "intro": "Elaphoglossum perelegans var. integrisquamulata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
