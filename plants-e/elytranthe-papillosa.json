    "intro": "Elytranthe papillosa, commonly known as the woolly leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, papillate (bumpy) leaves that give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, typical of ferns, and it reproduces through spore dispersal. It is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors, where it can access the moisture it requires. Elytranthe papillosa is a member of the family Pterobryaceae and is native to regions in South America."
