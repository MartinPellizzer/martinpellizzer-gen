    "intro": "Echium montanum, commonly known as mountain fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Echium montanum is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
