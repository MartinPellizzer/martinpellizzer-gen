    "intro": "Euphorbia lophogona, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia lophogona is adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
