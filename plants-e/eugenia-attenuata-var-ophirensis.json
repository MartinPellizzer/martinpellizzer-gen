    "intro": "Eugenia attenuata var. ophirensis, commonly known as the Ophirensis guava, is a tropical plant native to parts of South America. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree with simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red when ripe. The fruit is edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and is often used in culinary applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
