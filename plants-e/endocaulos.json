    "intro": "Endocaulos, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a stem that bears a single, showy flower head. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its flowers are typically yellow, with ray florets that resemble those of true dandelions. Endocaulos species are generally herbaceous and can be annual or perennial, depending on the species."
