It is characterized by its distinctive, winged sepals and petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a lip that is often darker in color. Epipactis alata is an herbaceous perennial that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a strong, spicy scent."
