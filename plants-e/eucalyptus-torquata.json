    "intro": "Eucalyptus torquata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the winter months. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in thin strips, revealing a mottled pattern of brown and grey. Eucalyptus torquata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions."
