    "intro": "Echinocactus bicolor var. typicus, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a striking cacti species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, multi-colored spines that range from yellow to red, giving it its common name. The plant features a short, thick stem with prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. This species is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stem and having a slow growth rate."
