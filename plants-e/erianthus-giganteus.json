    "intro": "Erianthus giganteus, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to the wetlands of the Americas. It features long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a fibrous, hollow stem. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist environments and is often found near rivers, lakes, and marshes. Its robust growth makes it both an important ecological species and a potential invasive plant in non-native regions."
