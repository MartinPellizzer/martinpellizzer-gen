It features smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
