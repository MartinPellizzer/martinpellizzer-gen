    "intro": "Epidendrum palmarum, commonly known as the palm-leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves that resemble palm fronds, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Epidendrum palmarum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
