    "intro": "Epidendrum complanatum, commonly known as the flat-leaved epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, colorful flowers that range from white to pink and purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum complanatum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
