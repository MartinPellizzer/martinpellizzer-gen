    "intro": "Erica quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often blooming in spring and early summer. Erica quadriflora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in garden landscapes in suitable climates."
