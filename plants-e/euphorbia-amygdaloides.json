    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides, commonly known as the amygdaloid spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are distinctive structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
