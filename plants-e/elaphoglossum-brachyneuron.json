    "intro": "Elaphoglossum brachyneuron, commonly known as the narrow-veined holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided pinnae and a distinctive, narrow vascular pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understoreys, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum brachyneuron is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticultural settings."
