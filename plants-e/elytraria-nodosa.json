    "intro": "Elytraria nodosa, commonly known as the clustered spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in dense clusters, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Elytraria nodosa is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
