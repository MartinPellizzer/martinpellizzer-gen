    "intro": "Eriodendron anfractuosum, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on mountain slopes. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is considered endangered in some regions."
