    "intro": "Euonymus europaeus var. nanus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are ornamental but toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its compact size and evergreen foliage make it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant."
