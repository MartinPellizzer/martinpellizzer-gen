    "intro": "Eriosyce sociabilis, commonly known as the social eriosyce, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, rounded structure. The plant produces small, white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Eriosyce sociabilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
