    "intro": "Euphorbia soongarica subsp. lamprocarpa, commonly known as the silver-leaved euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
