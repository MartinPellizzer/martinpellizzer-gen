    "intro": "Echium confusum var. sabulicola, commonly known as the sand echium, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
