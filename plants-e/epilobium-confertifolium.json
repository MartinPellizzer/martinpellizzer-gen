    "intro": "Epilobium confertifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved willow herb, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features upright, often branched stems covered with glandular hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a dense arrangement of short, stiff hairs. Its flowers are arranged in spikes, with showy pink to reddish-purple petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in wet environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
