    "intro": "Elytrigia lolioides, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Elytrigia lolioides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
