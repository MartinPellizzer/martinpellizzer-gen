    "intro": "Eriogonum calcareum var. calcareum, commonly known as the limestone buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in desert and foothill habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
