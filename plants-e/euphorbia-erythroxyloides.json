    "intro": "Euphorbia erythroxyloides, commonly known as the redwood spurge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, somewhat fleshy stems and leaves, which are typically green and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
