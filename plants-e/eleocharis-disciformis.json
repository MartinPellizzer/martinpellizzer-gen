    "intro": "Eleocharis disciformis, commonly known as the flat-spike sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its flowers are usually inconspicuous, with tiny, three-lobed perianths that develop into three-angled, dry fruits. Eleocharis disciformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
