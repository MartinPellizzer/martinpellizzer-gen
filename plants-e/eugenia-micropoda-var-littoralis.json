It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in mangrove or brackish water environments. This variety is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
