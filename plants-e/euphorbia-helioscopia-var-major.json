    "intro": "Euphorbia helioscopia var. major, commonly known as the sun spurge, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring upright stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and sunny habitats, often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
