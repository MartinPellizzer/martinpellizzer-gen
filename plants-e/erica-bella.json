    "intro": "Erica bella, commonly known as the beauty heather, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family, Ericaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica bella is evergreen, with dense, needle-like leaves that form compact shrubs. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in acidic, nutrient-poor conditions."
