    "intro": "Euphorbia gueinzii var. albovillosa, commonly known as the white-hairy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its branched stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique morphology and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
