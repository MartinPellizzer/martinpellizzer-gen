    "intro": "Eriochloa polystachya, commonly known as bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottle brush, composed of spikelets with long, bristly hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eriochloa polystachya plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
