    "intro": "Epidendrum brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and broad, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
