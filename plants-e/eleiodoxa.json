    "intro": "Eleiodoxa, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Eleiodoxa gossweileri, which is native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their aromatic wood and distinctive foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The genus is valued for its fragrant timber, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Eleiodoxa species typically grow in dry, wooded areas and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
