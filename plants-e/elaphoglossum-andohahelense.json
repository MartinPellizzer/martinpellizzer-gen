    "intro": "Elaphoglossum andohahelense, commonly known as the Andohahelen fern, is a rare and specialized member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with spores produced in compact, clustered sori on the underside of its leaves. Its habitat is highly restricted, making it particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered an important indicator species for the health of its native ecosystem."
