    "intro": "Erica pinea, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Erica pinea thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
