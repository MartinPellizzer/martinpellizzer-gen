    "intro": "Eucalyptus niphophloia, commonly known as the snow gum, is a tall, slender eucalyptus species native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often white or grey bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, dry habitat. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clustered inflorescences, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. This species is adapted to harsh environments and plays an important ecological role in its native range."
