    "intro": "Erodium graveolens, commonly known as sticky weed or redstem filaree, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, reddish stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by clusters of small, round, reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
