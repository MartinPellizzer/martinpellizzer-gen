    "intro": "Eichleria albescens, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals, which give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Eichleria albescens is considered a conservation concern."
