    "intro": "Erica curviflora var. curviflora, commonly known as the twisted flower heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica curviflora var. curviflora is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
