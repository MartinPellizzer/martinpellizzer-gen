    "intro": "Ecbolium anagallis, commonly known as the common stormworts, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and showy, spurred flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plants are usually found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have a creeping growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow them to spread vegetatively. Ecbolium anagallis species are known for their ecological importance, providing nectar for early pollinators."
