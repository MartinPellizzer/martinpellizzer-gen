    "intro": "Echinocactus mammulosus var. submammulosa, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It features a cylindrical stem with closely spaced, rounded ribs that are often covered in a powdery whitish coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne on short, lateral branches. It is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements in desert gardens."
