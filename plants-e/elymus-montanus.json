    "intro": "Elymus montanus, commonly known as mountain wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soils. Elymus montanus thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It is valued for its ability to withstand harsh conditions and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
