    "intro": "Ebnerella prolifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to the wet conditions of its environment. Ebnerella prolifera is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
