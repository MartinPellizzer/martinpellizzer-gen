    "intro": "Eriogonum arcuatum var. rupicola, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in mountainous regions."
