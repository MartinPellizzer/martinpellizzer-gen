    "intro": "Ericameria nauseosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf ericameria, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
