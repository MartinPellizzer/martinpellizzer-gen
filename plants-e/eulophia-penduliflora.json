    "intro": "Eulophia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of pendulous, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer, producing showy, white or pale yellow blossoms that hang from the stem. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid forest floor. Eulophia penduliflora is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as under tree canopies in tropical rainforests."
