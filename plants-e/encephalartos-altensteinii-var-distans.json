    "intro": "Encephalartos altensteinii var. distans, commonly known as the Cape mountain cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species."
