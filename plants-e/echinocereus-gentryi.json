    "intro": "Echinocereus gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features a globular stem covered with areoles that produce white to yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
