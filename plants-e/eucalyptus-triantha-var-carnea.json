    "intro": "Eucalyptus triantha var. carnea, commonly known as the pink-flowered ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin flakes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-green hue when young. Its most notable feature is its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
