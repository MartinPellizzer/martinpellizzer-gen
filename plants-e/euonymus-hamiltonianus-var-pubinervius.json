    "intro": "Euonymus hamiltonianus var. pubinervius, commonly known as the pubescent-veined woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern China. It features opposite, elliptic leaves with a distinctive pubescent (hairy) underside, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
