    "intro": "Erica carnea var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple heather, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, depending on the variety. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green, providing a striking contrast to its floral displays. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This versatile plant is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
