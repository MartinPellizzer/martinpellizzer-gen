    "intro": "Echinocereus maritimus var. hancockii, commonly known as the Hancock's prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant features cylindrical, ribbed stems covered with spines and areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces edible fruits, though they are generally smaller and less abundant compared to other prickly pear varieties."
