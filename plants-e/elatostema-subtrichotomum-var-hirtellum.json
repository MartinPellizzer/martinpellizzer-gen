    "intro": "Elatostema subtrichotomum var. hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy leaf elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is known for its fine, hairy texture on the leaf surfaces. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in umbels. This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a unique appearance among related species."
