    "intro": "Elaphoglossum jaliscanum, commonly known as the Jalisco holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Native to Mexico, particularly the state of Jalisco, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
