    "intro": "Elatine hydropiper var. orthosperma, commonly known as water pepper, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. The plant has tiny, clustered leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged or nearly so. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
