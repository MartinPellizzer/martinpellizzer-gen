    "intro": "Eupatorium chlorolepis, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, blue to lavender-colored flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
