    "intro": "Euphorbia polygonisperma, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
