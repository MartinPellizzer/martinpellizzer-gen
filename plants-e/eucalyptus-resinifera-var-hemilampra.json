    "intro": "Eucalyptus resinifera var. hemilampra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue in color. Its bark is fibrous and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is known for its aromatic oils released when the leaves are crushed. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and heat."
