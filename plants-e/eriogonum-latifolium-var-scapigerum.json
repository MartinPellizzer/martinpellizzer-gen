    "intro": "Eriogonum latifolium var. scapigerum, commonly known as the broadleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
