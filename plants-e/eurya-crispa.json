    "intro": "Eurya crispa, commonly known as the roughleaf waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract various bird species. Eurya crispa is typically found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Erythroxylaceae family."
