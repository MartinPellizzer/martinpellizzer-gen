    "intro": "Eriochilus collinus subsp. collinus, commonly known as the coastal eriochilus, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
