    "intro": "Euphorbia bicolor, commonly known as the white-spotted spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, ribbed stems that are often adorned with white or yellowish spots. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating. Euphorbia bicolor is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes."
