    "intro": "Euphrasia parvula, commonly known as the small yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces a single flower per stem, which attracts various pollinators. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
