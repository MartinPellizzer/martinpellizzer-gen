    "intro": "Epidendrum inconstans, commonly known as the variable epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Epidendrum inconstans is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
