    "intro": "Ervum villosum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its botanical features make it valuable in ecological and agricultural contexts."
