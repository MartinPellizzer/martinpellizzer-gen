    "intro": "Eragrostis niwahokori, commonly known as the Niwahokori grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
