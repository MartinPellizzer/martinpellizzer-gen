    "intro": "Eupatorium pedale, commonly known as white snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and a strong, sometimes disagreeable odor. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Historically, it has been used in folk medicine, though its toxicity has made it less common in modern herbal practices."
