    "intro": "Eurycaulis guerreroi, commonly known as the Guerrero's eurycaulis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
