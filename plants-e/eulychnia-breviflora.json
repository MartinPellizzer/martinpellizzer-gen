    "intro": "Eulychnia breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Eulychnia breviflora is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in xerophytic gardens."
