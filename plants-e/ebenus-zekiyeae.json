    "intro": "Ebenus zekiyeae, commonly known as the Zekiye's bladderwrack, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of Turkey. It belongs to the family Fucaceae and is characterized by its dark brown, leathery fronds that are typically submerged in marine environments. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure with a central axis and lateral branches, which are covered in small, bladder-like air bladders for buoyancy. It thrives in rocky substrates and is often found in shallow tidal zones where light and nutrients are abundant. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for marine biodiversity studies."
