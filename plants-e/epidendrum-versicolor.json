It is characterized by its strikingly colorful, showy flowers that come in a variety of hues, including pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), helping it retain water in its natural habitat. Epidendrum versicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
