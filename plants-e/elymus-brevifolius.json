    "intro": "Elymus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, narrow leaves and dense spikelets that form a tufted appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Elymus brevifolius is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often used in restoration ecology projects."
