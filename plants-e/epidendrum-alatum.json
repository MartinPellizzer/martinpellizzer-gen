    "intro": "Epidendrum alatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive red or orange lip, and it blooms during the rainy season. Epidendrum alatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment."
