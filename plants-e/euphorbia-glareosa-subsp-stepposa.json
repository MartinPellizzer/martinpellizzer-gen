    "intro": "Euphorbia glareosa subsp. stepposa, commonly known as the steppe euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
