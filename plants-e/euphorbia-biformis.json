    "intro": "Euphorbia biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia biformis is also known for its ability to store water in its leaves and stems, aiding in its survival in harsh conditions."
