    "intro": "Eleutherococcus leucorrhizus var. scaberulus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed eleuthero, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems covered with rough, ridged bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its berries are bright red, containing several seeds, and are an important food source for birds and small mammals. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties."
