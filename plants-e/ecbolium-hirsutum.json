    "intro": "Ecbolium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and distinctive, inflated pods. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to arid environments, helping to reduce water loss. The species is also noted for its role in supporting local insect pollinators."
