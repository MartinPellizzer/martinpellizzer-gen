    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 breinerorum, commonly known as the hybrid marsh helleborine, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphological features. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and bogs, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, while its flowers are greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip structure. This hybrid is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability."
