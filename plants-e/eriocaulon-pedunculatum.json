It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and bogs, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering structures, called spikelets, are often borne on slender, erect stems. Eriocaulon pedunculatum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
