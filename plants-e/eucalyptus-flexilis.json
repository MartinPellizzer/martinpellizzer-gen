    "intro": "Eucalyptus flexilis, commonly known as the slender ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, grey, and green. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
