    "intro": "Euphorbia gigantea, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal watering. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
