    "intro": "Euphorbia megalantha var. denticulata, commonly known as the toothed euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often spiny and have a distinctive toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
