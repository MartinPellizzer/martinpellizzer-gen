    "intro": "Espeletia congestiflora, commonly known as the \"Pineapple Plant\" or \"Candelabra Plant,\" is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence topped with numerous small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in high-altitude, arid environments make it an important species in cloud forest ecosystems. Espeletia congestiflora is also notable for its role in traditional Andean agriculture and its use in local horticulture."
