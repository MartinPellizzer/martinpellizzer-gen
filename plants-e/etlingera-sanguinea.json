    "intro": "Etlingera sanguinea, commonly known as the red torch ginger, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to the showy bracts. Etlingera sanguinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
