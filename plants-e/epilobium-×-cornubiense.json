    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 cornubiense, commonly known as the Cornish willow herb, is a hybrid plant species native to the British Isles. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are arranged in spikes, with showy pink to reddish-purple petals that bloom in late summer. Epilobium \u00d7 cornubiense plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects, and is of interest in botanical studies due to its hybrid origin and ecological significance."
