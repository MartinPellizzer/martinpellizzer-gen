    "intro": "Epilobium adnatum, commonly known as redstem silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, rocky soils along stream banks and in mountainous regions. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside and produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. Its stems are often reddish in color, which gives it its common name. Epilobium adnatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
