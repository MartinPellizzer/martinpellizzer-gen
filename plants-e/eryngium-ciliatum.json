    "intro": "Eryngium ciliatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features striking spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often lined with fine, bristly hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in sandy or saline soils. Eryngium ciliatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional herbal medicine."
