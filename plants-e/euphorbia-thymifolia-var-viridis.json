    "intro": "Euphorbia thymifolia var. viridis, commonly known as the greenleaf spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its slow growth and compact form make it an attractive addition to rock gardens and containers."
