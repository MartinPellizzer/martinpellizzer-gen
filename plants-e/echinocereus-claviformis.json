    "intro": "Echinocereus claviformis, commonly known as the cliff prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Echinocereus claviformis is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
