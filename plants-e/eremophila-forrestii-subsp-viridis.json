    "intro": "Eremophila forrestii subsp. viridis, commonly known as the green emu plant, is a shrub native to western Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for low-maintenance gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its more vibrant foliage compared to other Eremophila species."
