    "intro": "Endospermum myrmecophilum, commonly known as the ant-loving paperbark tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a papery inner layer. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its unique relationship with ants is a notable botanical feature, as the plant provides shelter and food for these insects. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
