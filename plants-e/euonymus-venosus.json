    "intro": "Euonymus venosus, commonly known as the veined spurge or red euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Euonymus venosus is also valued for its ability to tolerate various soil conditions and its resistance to pests and diseases."
