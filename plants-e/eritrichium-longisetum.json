    "intro": "Eritrichium longisetum, commonly known as the long-hair grass violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. Eritrichium longisetum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
