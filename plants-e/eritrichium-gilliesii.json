    "intro": "Eritrichium gilliesii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive hooded shape. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and talus slopes. Eritrichium gilliesii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
