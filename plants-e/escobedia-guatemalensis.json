    "intro": "Escobedia guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan escobedia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cactaceae. It is native to Mexico and Central America, particularly found in the highlands of Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale green or grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Escobedia guatemalensis is often used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
