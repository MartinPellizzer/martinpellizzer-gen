    "intro": "Elytrigia divaricata subsp. attenuatiglumis, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems with narrow, linear leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are shorter and more slender than those of the typical species. This subspecies is noted for its ecological adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
