    "intro": "Eriogonum kearneyi subsp. monoense, commonly known as the Mono Lake buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly around Mono Lake in California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is adapted to high elevation and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
