    "intro": "Elymus alberti, commonly known as the Albert's needlegrass, is a tall perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its seeds are small and wind-dispersed. Elymus alberti is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
