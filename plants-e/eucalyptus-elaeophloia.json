    "intro": "Eucalyptus elaeophloia, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands across southern Australia."
