    "intro": "Eruca sativa proles glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth rocket or a type of wild mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and pinnately lobed leaves that are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to arugula."
