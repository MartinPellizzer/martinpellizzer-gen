    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pascoense, commonly known as Pasco's holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a soft, fuzzy coating. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum pascoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
