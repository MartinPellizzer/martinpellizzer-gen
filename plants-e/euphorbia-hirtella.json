    "intro": "Euphorbia hirtella, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
