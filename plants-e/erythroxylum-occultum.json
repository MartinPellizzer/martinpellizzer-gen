    "intro": "Erythroxylum occultum, commonly known as the hidden erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It produces red, spherical berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
