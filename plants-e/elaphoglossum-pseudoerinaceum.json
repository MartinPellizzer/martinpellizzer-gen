    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pseudoerinaceum, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are often covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across parts of Asia and the Americas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
