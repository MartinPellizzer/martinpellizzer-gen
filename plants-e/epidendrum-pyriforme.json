    "intro": "Epidendrum pyriforme, commonly known as the boat-shaped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, boat-shaped pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum pyriforme is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
