    "intro": "Eucalyptus urophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf eucalypt, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is a tall, slender tree that can reach heights of up to 40 meters, with smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a blue-green hue, and they are typically arranged alternately along the branches. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well adapted to dry and disturbed environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
