    "intro": "Euphorbia cernua, commonly known as the hanging spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a distinctive appearance with its drooping, branched stems that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common characteristic among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Euphorbia cernua is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
