    "intro": "Eriochloa pacifica, commonly known as Pacific false brome, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of California and Oregon. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and coastal bluffs. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
