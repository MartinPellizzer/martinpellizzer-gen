    "intro": "Ericameria austrotexana, commonly known as the Texas goldenbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, branched growth habit and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ericameria austrotexana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
