    "intro": "Eurycaulis lankaviensis, commonly known as the Lankaviensis fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a striking bi-colored pattern of green and silver. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along the forest floor or on the bases of trees. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Eurycaulis lankaviensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
