    "intro": "Equisetum majus, commonly known as horse tail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are called strobila, which are cone-like formations at the top of the stem. Equisetum majus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of plant evolution."
