    "intro": "Eritrichium thymifolium subsp. thymifolium, commonly known as the thyme-leaved erythronium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, aromatic leaves that resemble thyme foliage, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
