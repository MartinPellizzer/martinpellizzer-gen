    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium f. rubrovaginatum, commonly known as the red-veined cottongrass, is a variant of the narrow-leaved cottongrass. It is characterized by its distinctive red pigmentation along the leaf margins and floral bracts, which sets it apart from the typical green form. This plant is typically found in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. Its small, fluffy seed heads contribute to its role in wind pollination and seed dispersal. The botanical features of this subspecies highlight its adaptation to its specific ecological niche."
