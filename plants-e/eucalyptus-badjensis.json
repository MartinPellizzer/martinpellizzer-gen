    "intro": "Eucalyptus badjensis, commonly known as the Badja gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus badjensis is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
