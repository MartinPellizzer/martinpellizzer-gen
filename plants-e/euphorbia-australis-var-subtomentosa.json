    "intro": "Euphorbia australis var. subtomentosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
