It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, with a sweet and aromatic flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Eugenia genus."
