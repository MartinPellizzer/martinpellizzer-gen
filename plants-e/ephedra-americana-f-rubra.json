    "intro": "Ephedra americana f. rubra, commonly known as red ephedra, is a rare variant of the ephedra plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The stems contain alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
