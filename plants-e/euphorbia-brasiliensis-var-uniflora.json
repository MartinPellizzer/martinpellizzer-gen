    "intro": "Euphorbia brasiliensis var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered spurge, is a striking plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and a single, showy yellow flower at the tip of each branch. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
