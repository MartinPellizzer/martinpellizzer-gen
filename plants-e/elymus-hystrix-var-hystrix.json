    "intro": "Elymus hystrix var. hystrix, commonly known as the rough false wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, wiry inflorescences that give it a distinctive, bristly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Elymus hystrix var. hystrix is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
