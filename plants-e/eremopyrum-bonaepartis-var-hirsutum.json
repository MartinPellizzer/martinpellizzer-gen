    "intro": "Eremopyrum bonaepartis var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy eremopyrum, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to yellowish flowers. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization in degraded habitats. This variety is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations."
