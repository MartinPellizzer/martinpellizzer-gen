    "intro": "Encyclia cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous orchid, is a rare and ancient orchid species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from limestone substrates, reflecting its historical presence during the Cretaceous period. Encyclia cretacea is of great interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and unique ecological adaptations."
