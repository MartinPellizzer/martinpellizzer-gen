The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats. This subspecies is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage crop for livestock."
