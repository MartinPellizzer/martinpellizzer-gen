    "intro": "Evaiezoa diapensoides, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive silver sheen on the underside. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
