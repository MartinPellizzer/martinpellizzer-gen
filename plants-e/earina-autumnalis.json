    "intro": "Earina autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate regions. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, and soil, forming a dense, mat-like structure. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its color ranges from yellowish-green to reddish-brown, depending on the season and environmental conditions. Earina autumnalis plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
