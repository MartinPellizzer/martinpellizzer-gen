    "intro": "Euphorbia armstrongiana var. armstrongiana, commonly known as Armstrong's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
