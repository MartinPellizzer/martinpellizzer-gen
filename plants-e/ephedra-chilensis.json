    "intro": "Ephedra chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which have been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is also classified as a controlled substance in many regions."
