    "intro": "Eriocaulon idukkianum, commonly known as the Idukki marsh plant, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands of India. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that often form dense mats on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, clustered white flowers that are typically short-lived and appear in the early summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with high humidity and nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
