    "intro": "Elymus margaritae, commonly known as the silvergrass or sea grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and dunes, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Elymus margaritae is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
