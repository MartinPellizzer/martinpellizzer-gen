    "intro": "Euphorbia platyphyllos var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated leaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves with a distinctive serrated edge, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
