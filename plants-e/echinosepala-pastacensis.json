    "intro": "Echinosepala pastacensis, commonly known as the Pastacensis Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Echinosepala pastacensis is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun exposure."
