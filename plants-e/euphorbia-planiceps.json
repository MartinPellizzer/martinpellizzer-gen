    "intro": "Euphorbia planiceps, commonly known as the flat-headed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with a distinctive flat, rounded head at the top, which is the site of its showy, yellowish-green flower clusters. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, typical of its arid habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Euphorbia planiceps is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
