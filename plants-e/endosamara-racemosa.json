    "intro": "Endosamara racemosa, commonly known as the clustered endosperm tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into distinctive endospermous fruits. The fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules that release seeds through a unique mechanism involving the detachment of the pericarp. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
