    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. ramulosum, commonly known as the ramose buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are generally narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
