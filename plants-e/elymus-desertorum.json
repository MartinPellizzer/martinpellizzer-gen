    "intro": "Elymus desertorum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Elymus desertorum is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems."
