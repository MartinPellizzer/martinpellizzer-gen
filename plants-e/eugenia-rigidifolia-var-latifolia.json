It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are broad and elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually pale pink or white, while the fruit is a small, round, fleshy berry.
