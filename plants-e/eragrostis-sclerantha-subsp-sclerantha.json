It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, stiff leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
