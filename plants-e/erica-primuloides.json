    "intro": "Erica primuloides, commonly known as the snowflake heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable addition to gardens in cooler climates. Erica primuloides is also appreciated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
