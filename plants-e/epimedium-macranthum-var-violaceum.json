    "intro": "Epimedium macranthum var. violaceum, commonly known as the purple-flowered barberry, is a deciduous perennial plant native to China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that turns a vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
