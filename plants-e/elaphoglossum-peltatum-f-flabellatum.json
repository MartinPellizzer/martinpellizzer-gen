It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, fan-like appearance in the mature stages. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in the study of fern morphology and biodiversity."
