It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in temperate regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
