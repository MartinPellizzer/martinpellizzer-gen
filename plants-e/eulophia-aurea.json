    "intro": "Eulophia aurea, commonly known as the golden eulophia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage and its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Eulophia aurea has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. Its flowers are usually arranged in a raceme and bloom during the warmer months of the year."
