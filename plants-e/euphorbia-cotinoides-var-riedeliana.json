    "intro": "Euphorbia cotinoides var. riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
