    "intro": "Encephalartos vroomii, commonly known as the Vroom\u2019s cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Encephalartos vroomii is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
