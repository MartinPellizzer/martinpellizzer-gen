    "intro": "Euphorbia commutata var. erecta, commonly known as the erect spurge, is a succulent plant native to parts of Africa. It features a short, woody stem with paired, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by colorful bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
