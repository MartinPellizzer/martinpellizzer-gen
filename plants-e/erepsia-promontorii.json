    "intro": "Erepsia promontorii, commonly known as the rock violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along sea cliffs and shores. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. Erepsia promontorii plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing nectar for early pollinators."
