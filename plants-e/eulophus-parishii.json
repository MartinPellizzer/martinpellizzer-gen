    "intro": "Eulophus parishii, commonly known as the Parry's leafhopper, is a small insect belonging to the family Eulophidae. It is primarily found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, inhabiting arid and semi-arid environments. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, though it is not a plant. Due to its classification as an insect, it does not have botanical characteristics in the traditional sense. Its presence is more relevant to entomology than botany."
