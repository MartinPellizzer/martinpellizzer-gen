    "intro": "Ericoides longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved erica, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Ericoides longifolium is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
