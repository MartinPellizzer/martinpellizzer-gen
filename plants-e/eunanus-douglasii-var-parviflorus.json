    "intro": "Eunanus douglasii var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered eunanus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
