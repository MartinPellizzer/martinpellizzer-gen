    "intro": "Echinocereus poselgeri subsp. gerhardii, commonly known as the Gerhard's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
