    "intro": "Eriocaulon paludicola, commonly known as the swamp eriocaulon, is a small aquatic plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slowly flowing water, often in marshy or swampy areas. The plant has a rosette-like growth pattern with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually borne in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Eriocaulon paludicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
