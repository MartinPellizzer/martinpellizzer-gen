    "intro": "Elatostema pachyceras, commonly known as the thick-shelled water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has a rosette-like structure with fleshy, thick leaves that help it retain water. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Elatostema pachyceras plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms."
