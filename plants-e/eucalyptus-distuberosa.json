    "intro": "Eucalyptus distuberosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in strips, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. Eucalyptus distuberosa is adapted to harsh, arid environments and plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
