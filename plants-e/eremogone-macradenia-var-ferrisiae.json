    "intro": "Eremogone macradenia var. ferrisiae, commonly known as the Cape York eremogone, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in northern Australia."
