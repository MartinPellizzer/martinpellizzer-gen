    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rivularum, commonly known as the stream fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum rivularum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
