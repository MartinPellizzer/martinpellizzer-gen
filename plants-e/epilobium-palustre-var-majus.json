It typically grows in marshes, fens, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies. The plant features slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a hairy texture. The showy pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are clustered in spikes and attract various pollinators."
