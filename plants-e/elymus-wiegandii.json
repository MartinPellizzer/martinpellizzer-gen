    "intro": "Elymus wiegandii, commonly known as Wiegand's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Elymus wiegandii thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often forming dense stands. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
