It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
