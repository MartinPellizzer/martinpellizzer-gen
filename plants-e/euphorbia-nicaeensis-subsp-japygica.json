    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis subsp. japygica, commonly known as the Canary Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adaptations that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
