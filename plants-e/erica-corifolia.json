    "intro": "Erica corifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color and are adapted to withstand coastal salt and wind. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. Erica corifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
