    "intro": "Eucalyptus epruinata, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to white bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery or greyish underside, contributing to its unique visual appeal. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in groups, typically in late winter to early spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
