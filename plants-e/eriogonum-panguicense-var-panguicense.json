    "intro": "Eriogonum panguicense var. panguicense, commonly known as the Panguis Basin buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the Panguis Basin in the Great Basin region of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
