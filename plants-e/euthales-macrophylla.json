    "intro": "Euthales macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its succulent nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
