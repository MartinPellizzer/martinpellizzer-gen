    "intro": "Euphorbia comans, commonly known as the Cape Harebell, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. It produces a unique type of fruit called a syncarp, which is a fused structure of multiple carpels. Euphorbia comans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable climates."
