    "intro": "Ephemerantha pectinata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in the wetlands and swamps of Florida and Georgia. The plant has long, thin roots and produces delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. Its unique growth habit and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
