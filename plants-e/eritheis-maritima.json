    "intro": "Eritheis maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eritheis maritima is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
