    "intro": "Eucalyptus bauerlesii, commonly known as the red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands. Eucalyptus bauerlesii is also valued for its timber and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices."
