    "intro": "Eurygania parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved water fern, is a delicate aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically submerged, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. Eurygania parvifolia plays a vital role in providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
