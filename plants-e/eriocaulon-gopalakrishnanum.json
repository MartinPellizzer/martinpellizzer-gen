    "intro": "Eriocaulon gopalakrishnanum, commonly known as the Gopalakrishnan's spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. This plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
