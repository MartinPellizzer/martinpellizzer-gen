It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. Its small, hairy leaves and short stems contribute to its drought-tolerant characteristics."
