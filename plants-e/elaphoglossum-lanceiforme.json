    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lanceiforme, commonly known as the lanceleaf hawksbeard, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in compact, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum lanceiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
