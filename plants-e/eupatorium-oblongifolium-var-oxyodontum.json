    "intro": "Eupatorium oblongifolium var. oxyodontum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boneset, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, narrow, and have a rough texture, with a bluish-green hue on top and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clustered heads, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and woodland edges, and is often found in swampy or poorly drained soils."
