    "intro": "Eupatorium scabrum, commonly known as rough eupatorium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the common name, and are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spherical heads, and bloom in late summer to early fall."
