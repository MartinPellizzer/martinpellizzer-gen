    "intro": "Eucalyptus purpurata, commonly known as the purple malletwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey to pinkish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or red. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in coastal or sandy soils. Eucalyptus purpurata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in coastal environments."
