It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in coastal regions. The flowers, which range in color from pink to white, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
