    "intro": "Erica algida, commonly known as the alpine heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Erica algida has dense foliage that helps prevent soil erosion and provides habitat for various small animals and insects. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
