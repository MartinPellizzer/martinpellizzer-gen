    "intro": "Euryops rehmannii, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in harsh, saline conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Euryops rehmannii is well adapted to coastal environments, with a deep root system that helps it withstand strong winds and periodic salt spray."
