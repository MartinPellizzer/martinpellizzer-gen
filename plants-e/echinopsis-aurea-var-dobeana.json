    "intro": "Echinopsis aurea var. dobeana, commonly known as the golden echinopsis, is a cactus species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically green to yellowish in color. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often nocturnal in bloom. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
