    "intro": "Echinocereus reichenbachii, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has spines that are typically yellow to reddish in color, providing protection from herbivores. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
