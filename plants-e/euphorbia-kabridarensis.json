    "intro": "Euphorbia kabridarensis, commonly known as the Kabrida euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the island of Sardinia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, segmented stems. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic milky sap, so caution is needed when handling it."
