    "intro": "Ericoides brevifolium, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ericoides brevifolium is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
