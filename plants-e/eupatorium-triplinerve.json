    "intro": "Eupatorium triplinerve, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, triplinerve leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
