    "intro": "Euthamia chrysothamnoides, commonly known as goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, disk-shaped flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Euthamia chrysothamnoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
