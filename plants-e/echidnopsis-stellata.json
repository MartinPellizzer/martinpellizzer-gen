It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and clusters of small, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in dense, branched clusters. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Echidnopsis stellata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
