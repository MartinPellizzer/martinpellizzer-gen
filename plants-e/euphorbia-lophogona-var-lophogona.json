    "intro": "Euphorbia lophogona var. lophogona, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures, typically appearing in clusters. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a common characteristic among the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant's ability to survive with minimal water makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
