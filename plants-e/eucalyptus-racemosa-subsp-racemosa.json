It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that ranges from grey to yellowish in color. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive blue-green hue when mature. It produces creamy-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which attract a variety of pollinators. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
