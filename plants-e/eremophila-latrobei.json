    "intro": "Eremophila latrobei, commonly known as the Northern River Red Gum, is a species of flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in riverine habitats, often along the banks of watercourses in the eastern and southern regions of the country. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color, and it produces spikes of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red. Eremophila latrobei is adapted to seasonal rainfall and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native environment. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining the health of riparian ecosystems."
