    "intro": "Echites scaber, commonly known as rough echites, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
