    "intro": "Elymus tibeticus, commonly known as Tibetan wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces dense panicles of spikelets, which are typically green to golden in color. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Elymus tibeticus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife."
