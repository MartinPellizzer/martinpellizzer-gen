It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, violet-pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its vibrant color. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
