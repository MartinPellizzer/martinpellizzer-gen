The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and tough, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. This grass is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional herbal medicine in some regions."
