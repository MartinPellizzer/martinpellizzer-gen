It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover."
