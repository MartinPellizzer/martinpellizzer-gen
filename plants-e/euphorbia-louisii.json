    "intro": "Euphorbia louisii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, spiny stems and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has adapted to arid environments with thick, water-storing leaves and a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Euphorbia louisii is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
