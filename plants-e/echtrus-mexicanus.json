    "intro": "Echtrus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican echtrus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its flowers are often pale blue or violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Echtrus mexicanus is considered a rare and endangered species."
