    "intro": "Echinocereus subinermis subsp. ochoterenae, commonly known as the Ochoterenae Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing cactus with a compact, rounded shape and typically features a dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne on short stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh desert environments."
