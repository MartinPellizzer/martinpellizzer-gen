    "intro": "Epidendrum paranthicum, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces fragrant, showy flowers during the holiday season. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and clusters of pendulous, pink or red flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum paranthicum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
