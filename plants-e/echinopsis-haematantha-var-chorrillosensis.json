    "intro": "Echinopsis haematantha var. chorrillosensis, commonly known as the Chorrillos night bloomer, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of Peru. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a cluster of spines at the base. The plant produces large, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water due to its desert adaptation. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
