    "intro": "Ephippiorhynchium triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered ephippiorhynchium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
