    "intro": "Erythraea divaricata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the western Pacific islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
