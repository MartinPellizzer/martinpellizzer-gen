    "intro": "Erodium bipinnatum proles sabulicola, commonly known as the sandhill bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or sandy habitats. It is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland sand plains."
