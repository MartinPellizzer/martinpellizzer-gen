    "intro": "Epipactis tallosii, commonly known as the talloso orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Epipactis tallosii has a unique root system that helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
