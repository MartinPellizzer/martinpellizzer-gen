    "intro": "Euphorbia polygona var. nivea, commonly known as the snow euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
