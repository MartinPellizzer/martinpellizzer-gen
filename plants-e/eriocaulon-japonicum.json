    "intro": "Eriocaulon japonicum, commonly known as Japanese spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often overlooked, but they play a role in its reproductive cycle. Eriocaulon japonicum is valued in traditional medicine and is also used in ornamental horticulture for its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
