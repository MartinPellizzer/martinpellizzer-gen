    "intro": "Edanyoa difformis, commonly known as the irregular leaf cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant has a thick, woody trunk and produces cones rather than flowers. Its leaves are typically dark green and can grow up to several meters in length. Due to its endangered status, it is protected in its native habitat and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
