    "intro": "Euphorbia physalifolia, commonly known as the \"bottle tree,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating. Euphorbia physalifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
