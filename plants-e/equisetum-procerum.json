    "intro": "Equisetum procerum, commonly known as the tall scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a hollow, jointed stem that is often used for its abrasive properties. The plant produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called strobila. Equisetum procerum is typically found in moist, calcareous soils and can be an indicator plant for certain environmental conditions. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
