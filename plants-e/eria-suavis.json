    "intro": "Eria suavis, commonly known as the sweet orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that emit a sweet scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss."
