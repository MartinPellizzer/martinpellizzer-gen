    "intro": "Elaphoglossum planicosta, commonly known as the flat-veined holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive flat venation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum planicosta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
