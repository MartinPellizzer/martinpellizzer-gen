    "intro": "Eriophorum gracile var. coreanum, commonly known as the Korean cotton grass, is a variant of the slender cotton grass species. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly Korea and northern China. The plant is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the tips of its flowering stems. It thrives in moist, sandy or peaty soils, often found in wetlands and along the edges of bogs. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
