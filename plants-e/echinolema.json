    "intro": "Echinolema, commonly known as the spiny leaf plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It typically features narrow, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing a textured appearance. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinolema thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for gardens in temperate climates. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
