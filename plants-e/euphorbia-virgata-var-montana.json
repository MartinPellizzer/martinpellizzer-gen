    "intro": "Euphorbia virgata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
