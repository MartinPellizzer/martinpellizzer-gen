    "intro": "Elymus longisetus, commonly known as the long-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, hairy leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Elymus longisetus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
