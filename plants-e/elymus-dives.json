    "intro": "Elymus dives, commonly known as the rough false wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Elymus dives is adapted to grow in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
