    "intro": "Encyclia profusa, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of flowers, with each bloom featuring three sepals and three petals, one of which is modified into a lip. Encyclia profusa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
