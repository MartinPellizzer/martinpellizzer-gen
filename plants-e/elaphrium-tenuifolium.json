    "intro": "Elaphrium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf elaphrium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
