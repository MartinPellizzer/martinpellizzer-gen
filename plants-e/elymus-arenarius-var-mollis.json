    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. mollis, commonly known as silky sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, coastal areas, and disturbed sites. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to bluish-green, and the seeds are small and wind-dispersed. This grass is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy environments."
