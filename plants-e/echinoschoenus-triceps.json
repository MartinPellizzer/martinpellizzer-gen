    "intro": "Echinoschoenus triceps, commonly known as the three-armed sea grass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal and estuarine environments. It is characterized by its unique tripartite inflorescence, which consists of three elongated, bract-like structures. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically submerged, adapted for underwater photosynthesis. It plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Echinoschoenus triceps is often found in shallow waters, where it contributes to the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems."
