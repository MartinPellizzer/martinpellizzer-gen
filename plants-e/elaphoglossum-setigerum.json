    "intro": "Elaphoglossum setigerum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, though this trait is more pronounced in certain species within the genus. Elaphoglossum setigerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
