    "intro": "Eriogonum arborescens, commonly known as the tree buckwheat, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Eriogonum arborescens plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
