    "intro": "Epidendrum falsiloquum, commonly known as the False Story Orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs covered in narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, elongated shape. Epidendrum falsiloquum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
