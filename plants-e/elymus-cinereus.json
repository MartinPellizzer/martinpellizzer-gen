    "intro": "Elymus cinereus, commonly known as grey false wheat, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets, which produce wind-pollinated flowers. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats."
