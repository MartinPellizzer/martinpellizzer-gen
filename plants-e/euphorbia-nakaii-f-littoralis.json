    "intro": "Euphorbia nakaii f. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal euphorbia, is a variant of the Japanese euphorbia species. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid or coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It is native to coastal regions of Japan and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its drought tolerance and distinctive appearance."
