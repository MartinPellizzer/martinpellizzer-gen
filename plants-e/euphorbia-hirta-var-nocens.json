    "intro": "Euphorbia hirta var. nocens, commonly known as the stinging euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine, hair-like structures that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap contains irritants and toxins, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its noxious properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing effects."
