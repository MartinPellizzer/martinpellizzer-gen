It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are covered in soft, white bristles. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are gray-green with a hairy texture, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring. Echinops crispus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
