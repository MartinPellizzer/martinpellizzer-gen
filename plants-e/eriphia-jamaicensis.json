    "intro": "Eriphia jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican eriphia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in coastal areas or lowland forests. Its flowers are usually clustered in umbels and display a range of colors, including white, pink, and red. The leaves are simple and opposite, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
