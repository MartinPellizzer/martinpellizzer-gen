It features dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to coastal and rocky garden environments."
