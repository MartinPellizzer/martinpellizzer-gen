    "intro": "Euphorbia tricolor, commonly known as the three-color spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with three distinct color zones: green, yellow, and red, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters called cyathia, typically in shades of yellow or green. It has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia tricolor is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
