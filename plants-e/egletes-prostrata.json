    "intro": "Egletes prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate egletes, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent with fleshy, cylindrical stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
