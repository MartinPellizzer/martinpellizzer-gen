    "intro": "Eschweilera sessilis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
