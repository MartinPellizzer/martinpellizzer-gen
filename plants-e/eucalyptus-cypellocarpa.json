    "intro": "Eucalyptus cypellocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallet gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and attract various pollinators. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils."
