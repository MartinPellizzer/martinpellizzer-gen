    "intro": "Elymus dasystachys var. maximoviczii, commonly known as the broad-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and wide, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, which are a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
