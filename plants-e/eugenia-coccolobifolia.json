    "intro": "Eugenia coccolobifolia, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often fragrant. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in coastal and saline environments. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Eugenia coccolobifolia is often found in coastal areas, mangroves, and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
