    "intro": "Eugenia hemispherica, commonly known as the red cedar or red gum, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by edible, dark blue berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine habitats. Eugenia hemispherica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
