It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, white to pale blue flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in dense, flat clusters.
