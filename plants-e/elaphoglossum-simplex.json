It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and have a soft, feathery appearance. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Elaphoglossum simplex has small, spore-producing structures called sori that are located on the underside of its leaves. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
