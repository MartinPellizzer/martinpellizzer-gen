    "intro": "Euphorbia maritima, commonly known as sea spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in salty, sandy soils and is highly adapted to maritime environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. Euphorbia maritima plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
