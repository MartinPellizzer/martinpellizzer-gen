It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue-to-purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Eupatorium multiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local pollinators."
