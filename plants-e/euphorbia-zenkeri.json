    "intro": "Euphorbia zenkeri, commonly known as the Zanzibar spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it contains toxic milky sap that requires careful handling."
