It is characterized by its vibrant red, silky petals that surround a central cluster of bright orange stamens. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Emilia coccinea thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation.
