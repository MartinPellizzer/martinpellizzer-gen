It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of pendulous, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
