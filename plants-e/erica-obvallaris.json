    "intro": "Erica obvallaris, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Erica obvallaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
