    "intro": "Euphorbia fasciculata, commonly known as the whorled euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia fasciculata is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
