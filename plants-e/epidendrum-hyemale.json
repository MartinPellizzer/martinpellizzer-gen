    "intro": "Epidendrum hyemale, commonly known as the yellow epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. Epidendrum hyemale is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
