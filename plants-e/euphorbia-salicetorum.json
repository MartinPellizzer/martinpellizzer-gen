    "intro": "Euphorbia salicetorum, commonly known as the willowleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Euphorbia salicetorum is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
