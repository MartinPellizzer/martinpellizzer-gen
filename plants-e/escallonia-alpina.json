It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions. Escallonia alpina is also valued for its resilience to harsh climates and its role in supporting local wildlife."
