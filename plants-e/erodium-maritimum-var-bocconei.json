    "intro": "Erodium maritimum var. bocconei, commonly known as the Mediterranean bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, pinkish to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. This variety is closely related to other species in the Geraniaceae family and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal conditions."
