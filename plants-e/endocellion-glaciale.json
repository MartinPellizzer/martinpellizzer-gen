    "intro": "Endocellion glaciale, commonly known as the glacier moss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to cold, alpine environments. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh, arid conditions. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden beneath its foliage. Endocellion glaciale plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
