    "intro": "Euphorbia hyberna var. insularis, commonly known as the Canary Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its distinctive flower-like structures. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
