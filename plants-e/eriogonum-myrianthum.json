It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, three-lobed seeds. Eriogonum myrianthum is an important nectar source for pollinators and is often found in chaparral and woodland ecosystems."
