It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Erianthus appressus is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and along roadsides, contributing to ecological diversity in these habitats."
