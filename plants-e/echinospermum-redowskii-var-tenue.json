It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
