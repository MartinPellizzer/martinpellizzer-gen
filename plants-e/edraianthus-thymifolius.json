    "intro": "Edraianthus thymifolius, commonly known as the thyme-leaved eryngo, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and small, gray-green leaves that resemble those of thyme. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Edraianthus thymifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
