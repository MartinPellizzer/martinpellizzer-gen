It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a characteristic species of tidal environments. Its ecological role includes stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
