    "intro": "Euphorbia homophylla, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, pale green leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and indoor collections."
