    "intro": "Eleocharis albibracteata var. boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in dense spikes. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that aids in water retention. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
