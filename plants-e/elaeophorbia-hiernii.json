    "intro": "Elaeophorbia hiernii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care. Elaeophorbia hiernii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
