The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Eriochilus petricola is often found in coastal and inland regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
