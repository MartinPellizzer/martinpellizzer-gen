    "intro": "Epipactis rubiginosa var. orbicularis, commonly known as the red-stemmed helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and striking reddish-brown flower spikes that bear showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. The orbicularis variety is distinguished by its rounded leaf shape and slightly different floral structure compared to other varieties of Epipactis rubiginosa."
