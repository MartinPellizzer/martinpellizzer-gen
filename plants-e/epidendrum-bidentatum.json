    "intro": "Epidendrum bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum bidentatum is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
