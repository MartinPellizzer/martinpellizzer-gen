    "intro": "Euphorbia delicatula, commonly known as the delicate spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, which are actually modified inflorescences called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
