    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. typicum, commonly known as the marsh willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, often boggy habitats in temperate regions. It features slender, often reddish stems that are typically covered in fine hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are pink to purple, forming clustered spikes at the top of the plant, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in consistently moist conditions."
