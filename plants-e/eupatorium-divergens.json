    "intro": "Eupatorium divergens, commonly known as blueweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, blue-green foliage and showy, pale blue to lavender flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eupatorium divergens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
