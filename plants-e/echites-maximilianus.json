    "intro": "Echites maximilianus, commonly known as the Mexican fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun. Echites maximilianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
