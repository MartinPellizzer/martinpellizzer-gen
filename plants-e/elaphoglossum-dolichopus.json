    "intro": "Elaphoglossum dolichopus, commonly known as the long-stalked harts-tongue fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, upright rhizome with closely spaced, lanceolate fronds that are usually dark green and slightly curled. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. This species is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
