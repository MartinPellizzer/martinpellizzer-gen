    "intro": "Epidendrum iguagoi, commonly known as the Iguazu Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, adding a striking visual element to its environment. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum iguagoi is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
