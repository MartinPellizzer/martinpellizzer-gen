    "intro": "Ephedra trifurca, commonly known as the three-branched ephedra, is a gymnosperm native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Ephedra trifurca is notable for containing ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various desert organisms."
