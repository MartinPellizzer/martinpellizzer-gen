    "intro": "Echeandia tamaulipensis, commonly known as the Tamaulipan echium, is a flowering plant native to the Tamaulipan mezquital region of northeastern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, characterized by its upright stem and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
