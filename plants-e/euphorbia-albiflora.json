    "intro": "Euphorbia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and smooth, often greyish stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Euphorbia albiflora is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
