It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
