    "intro": "Endiandra poueboensis, commonly known as the Central African sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, dense foliage, and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
