    "intro": "Erucastrum armoracioides, commonly known as the creeping rocket, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, lobed leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in dry conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily across different habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
