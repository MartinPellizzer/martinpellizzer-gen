    "intro": "Epimedium grandiflorum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the barrenwort, is a deciduous perennial native to China. It features attractive, heart-shaped leaves that emerge in early spring before the flowers. The plant produces showy, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and early blooming habit."
