    "intro": "Erodium californicum, commonly known as California pusley, is a low-growing annual herb native to western North America. It features small, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has a sprawling growth habit and can spread rapidly through its extensive root system. Erodium californicum is also known for its ability to self-seed prolifically, contributing to its widespread distribution."
