    "intro": "Encyclia pseudopygmaea, commonly known as the miniature bromeliad, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact stature and vibrant, often colorful inflorescences. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its fibrous roots to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Encyclia pseudopygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
