    "intro": "Euonymus carnosus, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
