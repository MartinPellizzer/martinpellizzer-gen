    "intro": "Eschweilera sandwithiana, commonly known as the Sandwith's evergreen, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
