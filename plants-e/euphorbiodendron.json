    "intro": "Euphorbiodendron, commonly known as the spurge tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbiodendron species are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. They are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and unique floral structures."
