    "intro": "Ereicoctis capitata, commonly known as the red-headed orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a distinctive yellow or green throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
