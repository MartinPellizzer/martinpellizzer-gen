It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are often fragrant. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are red when mature. Eugenia herbacea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near mangroves. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
