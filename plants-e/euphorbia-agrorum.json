    "intro": "Euphorbia agrorum, commonly known as the field spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Euphorbia agrorum is often considered a weed but can serve as a host plant for certain insects and butterflies."
