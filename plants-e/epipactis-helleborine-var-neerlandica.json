    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine var. neerlandica, commonly known as the Dutch helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a striking inflorescence of greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. This variant is native to Europe, particularly the Netherlands, and thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant is notable for its ability to hybridize with other epipactis species, leading to genetic diversity. Its orchid-like appearance and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
