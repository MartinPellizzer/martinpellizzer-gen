    "intro": "Ericoides stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the moist, acidic soils of temperate regions. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically produces white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Ericoides stenophyllum thrives in shaded, well-drained environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky areas. Its slow growth and compact form make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
