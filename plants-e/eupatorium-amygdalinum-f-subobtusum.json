    "intro": "Eupatorium amygdalinum f. subobtusum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white snakeroot, is a variant of the white snakeroot plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are broader at the base and more tapering towards the tip. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are often hairy and may have a reddish tinge, while the leaves are usually covered in fine pubescence. This subspecies is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful to livestock and humans."
