    "intro": "Erythranthe cinnabarina, commonly known as the scarlet monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Erythranthe cinnabarina is often found in California and Oregon, where it thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments."
