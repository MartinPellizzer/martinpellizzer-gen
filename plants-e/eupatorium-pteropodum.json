    "intro": "Eupatorium pteropodum, commonly known as the white boneset, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, paniculate inflorescences, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous and has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Eupatorium pteropodum thrives in moist, sunny habitats and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
