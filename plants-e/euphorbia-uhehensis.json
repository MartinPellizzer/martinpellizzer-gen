    "intro": "Euphorbia uhehensis, commonly known as the Uhehena spurge, is a succulent plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and latex contain toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia uhehensis is often used in traditional medicine, though its use requires caution due to its potentially harmful properties."
