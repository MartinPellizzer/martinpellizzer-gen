    "intro": "Euphorbia maromokotrensis, commonly known as the Malagasy spurge, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
