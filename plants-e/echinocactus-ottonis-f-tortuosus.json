    "intro": "Echinocactus ottonis f. tortuosus, commonly known as the twisted hedgehog cactus, is a unique and striking cactus native to Mexico. It is a variant of the Echinocactus ottonis species, characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted stems. The plant features a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. This ornamental cactus is well-suited for arid climates and requires minimal water once established."
