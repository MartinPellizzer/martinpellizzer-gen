    "intro": "Epidendrum brachiatum, commonly known as the Broad-leafed Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum brachiatum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
