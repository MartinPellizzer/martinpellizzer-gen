    "intro": "Echium virescens var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf viper's bugloss, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces striking spikes of violet-blue flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
