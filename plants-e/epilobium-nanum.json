    "intro": "Epilobium nanum, commonly known as dwarf willow, is a small, herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in shaded forest understories. Epilobium nanum is often found in wetland habitats and is an important part of the local ecosystem."
