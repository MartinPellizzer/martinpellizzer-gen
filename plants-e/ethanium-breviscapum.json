    "intro": "Ethanium breviscapum, commonly known as the short-capped ethanium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Ethanium breviscapum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
