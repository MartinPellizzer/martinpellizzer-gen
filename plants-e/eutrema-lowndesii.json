    "intro": "Eutrema lowndesii, commonly known as the Lowndes' sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, adapting to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Eutrema lowndesii plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal invertebrates."
