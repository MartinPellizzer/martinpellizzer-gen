    "intro": "Euphorbia geyeri, commonly known as the Geyeri spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with numerous upright, spiny branches that are often covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky environments. Euphorbia geyeri is known for its striking appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
