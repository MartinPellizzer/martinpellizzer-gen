    "intro": "Encephalocarpus strobiliformis, commonly known as the African candlewood, is a unique plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its distinctive, candle-like inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, helmet-shaped fruits, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. The botanical features of E. strobiliformis make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
