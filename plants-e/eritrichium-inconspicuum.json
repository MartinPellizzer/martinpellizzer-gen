It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Eritrichium inconspicuum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
