It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Eugenia cuprea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
