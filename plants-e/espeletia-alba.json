    "intro": "Espeletia alba, commonly known as the white espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its rosette growth form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often during the dry season. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Espeletia alba is adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems."
