    "intro": "Elaeagnus rhamnoides, commonly known as silver berry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, yellowish-green berries that ripen in the fall. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its capacity for nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are often clustered in catkins. Elaeagnus rhamnoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in erosion control due to its extensive root system."
