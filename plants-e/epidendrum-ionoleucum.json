    "intro": "Epidendrum ionoleucum, commonly known as the white-lipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Epidendrum ionoleucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
