    "intro": "Ephemerantha crenicristata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ephemeral, is a small, flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in sandy or rocky soils, often in desert or semi-arid environments. It has a short growing season, blooming in early spring before the heat of summer arrives. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
