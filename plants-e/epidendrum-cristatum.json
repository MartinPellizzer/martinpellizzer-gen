    "intro": "Epidendrum cristatum, commonly known as the crested vanda, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, flattened, and often brightly colored pseudobulbs, which are covered in a dense layer of roots. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a distinct, elongated shape. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Epidendrum cristatum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
