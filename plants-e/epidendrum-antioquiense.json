    "intro": "Epidendrum antioquiense, commonly known as the Antioquian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
