    "intro": "Euphorbia cacalina, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling the plant requires caution. Euphorbia cacalina plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils."
