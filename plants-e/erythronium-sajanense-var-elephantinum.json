    "intro": "Erythronium sajanense var. elephantinum, commonly known as the elephant garlic plant, is a bulbous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and often tinged with red at the base. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive, spurred petal. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in some regions. This variety is closely related to other members of the Colocasiaceae family and is prized for both its ornamental and culinary uses."
