    "intro": "Eragrostis ovina, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and tufted inflorescences that resemble those of true bluegrasses. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to green flowers. Eragrostis ovina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
