It is characterized by its vibrant, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a sturdy structure for supporting its flowering spikes. Epidendrum profusum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
