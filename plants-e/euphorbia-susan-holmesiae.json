    "intro": "Euphorbia susan-holmesiae, commonly known as Susan Holmes' spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in arid landscapes."
