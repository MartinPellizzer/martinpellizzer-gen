    "intro": "Echinocactus alteolens, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. Echinocactus alteolens is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
