    "intro": "Eugenia coloradoensis, commonly known as the Colorado holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates."
