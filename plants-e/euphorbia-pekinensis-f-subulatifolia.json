    "intro": "Euphorbia pekinensis f. subulatifolia, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant characterized by its dense, spiny, and fleshy foliage. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to China, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a short, thick stem with numerous upright, spiny branches that are covered in a fine, woolly coating. Its leaves are small, triangular, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
