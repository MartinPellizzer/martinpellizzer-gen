    "intro": "Euphorbia andrachnoides, commonly known as the Armenian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems are broken, a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its foliage is usually fleshy and adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for dry climates."
