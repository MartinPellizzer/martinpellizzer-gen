    "intro": "Erythrina nervosa, commonly known as the red flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has feathery, trifoliate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its seeds are encased in pods and contain toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Erythrina nervosa is valued in horticulture for its vibrant color and ability to thrive in warm, sunny environments."
