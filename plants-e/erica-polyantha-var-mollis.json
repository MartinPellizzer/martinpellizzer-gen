    "intro": "Erica polyantha var. mollis, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with soft, silvery-white to greyish-blue leaves that give it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
