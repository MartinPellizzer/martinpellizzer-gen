    "intro": "Erodium carvifolium, commonly known as stinkcup, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, kidney-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, cup-like structure, which aids in wind dispersal. Erodium carvifolium is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
