    "intro": "Epidendrum secundum, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching stems that often hang from trees, with clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually green with a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Epidendrum secundum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
