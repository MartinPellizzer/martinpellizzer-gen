    "intro": "Epidendrum asperum, commonly known as the rough epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its upright, branching stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, hairy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum asperum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
