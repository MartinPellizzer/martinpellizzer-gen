    "intro": "Eriocaulon stipantepalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a frosted appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in summer, and are adapted for wind pollination. Eriocaulon stipantepalum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
