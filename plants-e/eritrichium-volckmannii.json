    "intro": "Eritrichium volckmannii, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, linear leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and gravelly areas. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
