It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that are typically covered in a soft, hairy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
