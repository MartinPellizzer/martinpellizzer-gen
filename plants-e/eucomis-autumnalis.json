    "intro": "Eucomis autumnalis, commonly known as the purple fountain grass, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, arching inflorescences that resemble fountain-like structures, adorned with small, spiky purple bracts. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, adding a unique visual appeal. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. Eucomis autumnalis is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden borders."
