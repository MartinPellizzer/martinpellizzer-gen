    "intro": "Eruca pinnatifida, commonly known as wild rocket or Italian arugula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed, with a peppery, spicy aroma due to its high concentration of glucosinolates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a common weed in cultivated fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its widespread distribution across temperate climates."
