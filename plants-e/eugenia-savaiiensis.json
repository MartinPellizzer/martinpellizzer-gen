    "intro": "Eugenia savaiiensis, commonly known as the Savaii guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Savaii in Samoa. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by edible, pinkish-red fruits. The fruits are typically small, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and are used both for consumption and in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value and unique flavor make it a notable species in the region's flora."
