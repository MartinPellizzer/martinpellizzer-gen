    "intro": "Euphorbia selousiana, commonly known as the Selous euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can store water in its stem. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
