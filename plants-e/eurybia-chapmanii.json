    "intro": "Eurybia chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy areas. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs and produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers in the late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a slightly hairy surface. Eurybia chapmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
