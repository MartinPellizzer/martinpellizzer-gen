    "intro": "Erysimum horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with slender stems that spread horizontally across the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
