    "intro": "Erythroxylum roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima copal tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for medicinal purposes. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
