    "intro": "Eupatorium schultzii f. typicum, commonly known as Schultze's eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture with serrated edges. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects and birds."
