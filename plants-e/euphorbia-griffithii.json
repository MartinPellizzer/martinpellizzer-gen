    "intro": "Euphorbia griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of India and Nepal. It features a thick, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia griffithii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant with low water requirements."
