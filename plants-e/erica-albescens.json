    "intro": "Erica albescens, commonly known as the white heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica albescens is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
