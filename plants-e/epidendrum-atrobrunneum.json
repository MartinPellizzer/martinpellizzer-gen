    "intro": "Epidendrum atrobrunneum, commonly known as the dark brown epidendron, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark brown to blackish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum atrobrunneum is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
