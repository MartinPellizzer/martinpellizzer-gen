    "intro": "Epidendrum saltatrix, commonly known as the climbing Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Epidendrum saltatrix is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic."
