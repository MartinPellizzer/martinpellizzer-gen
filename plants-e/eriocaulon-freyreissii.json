    "intro": "Eriocaulon freyreissii, commonly known as the Freyreiss's spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with numerous tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils, typically found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
