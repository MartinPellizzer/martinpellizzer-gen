    "intro": "Encyclia dickinsoniana, commonly known as the Dickinson's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Encyclia dickinsoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
