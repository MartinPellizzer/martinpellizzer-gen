    "intro": "Elymus angustatus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, riverbanks, and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas. Botanically, it is part of the Poaceae family and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
