    "intro": "Epidendrum valenteanum, commonly known as the Valenton's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching stems that can grow up to several meters in length, supporting clusters of pendant, showy flowers. The plant produces intricate, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments with good air circulation and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and role in the diverse orchid flora of the Neotropics."
