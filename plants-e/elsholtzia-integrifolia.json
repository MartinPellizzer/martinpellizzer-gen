    "intro": "Elsholtzia integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved elsholtzia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are entire, meaning they have no serrations or teeth along the edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
