    "intro": "Epidendrum campaccii, commonly known as the Campacci's epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in tropical forests. Epidendrum campaccii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
