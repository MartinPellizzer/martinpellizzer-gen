It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
