It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of vibrant red or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, with a shallow root system that helps it conserve moisture. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.
