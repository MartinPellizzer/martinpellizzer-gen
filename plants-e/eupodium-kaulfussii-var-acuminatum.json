It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
