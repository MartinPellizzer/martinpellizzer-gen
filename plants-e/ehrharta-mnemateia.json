    "intro": "Ehrharta mnemateia, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It is adapted to saline and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in dune environments. Ehrharta mnemateia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and withstand harsh coastal conditions."
