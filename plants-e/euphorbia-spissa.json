    "intro": "Euphorbia spissa, commonly known as the stiff spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, further adapting it to drought conditions. Euphorbia spissa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
