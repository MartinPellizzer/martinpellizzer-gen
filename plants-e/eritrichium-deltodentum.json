    "intro": "Eritrichium deltodentum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The leaves are typically narrow and toothed, giving the plant its specific epithet \"deltodentum,\" which refers to the deltoid (triangle-shaped) teeth on the leaf margins. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare species in its native habitat."
