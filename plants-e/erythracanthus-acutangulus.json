    "intro": "Erythracanthus acutangulus, commonly known as the sharp-fruited erythracanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
