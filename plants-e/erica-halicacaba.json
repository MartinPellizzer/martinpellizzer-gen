    "intro": "Erica halicacaba, commonly known as the scented heath, is a flowering shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, evergreen foliage that is often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica halicacaba thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
