    "intro": "Euphorbia rothiana, commonly known as the sticky euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are often the most noticeable part. It has a milky sap that can be irritant to the skin, a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. Euphorbia rothiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to adapt to dry conditions."
