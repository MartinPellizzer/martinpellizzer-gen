    "intro": "Eroteum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty ermine, is a small, annual plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is adapted to thrive in temperate climates. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
