    "intro": "Equisetum bogotense var. nudum, commonly known as the naked scouring rush, is a rare and specialized fern-like plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family, which includes ancient vascular plants with a long evolutionary history. The plant is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures rather than true leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous forests and boggy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
