    "intro": "Enemion occidentale var. coloratum, commonly known as the purple poppy or western enemion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and produces clusters of showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
