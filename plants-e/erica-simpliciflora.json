    "intro": "Erica simpliciflora, commonly known as the simple-flowered heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to South Africa, where it typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. It is a low-growing shrub, often forming dense mats in its natural habitat. Erica simpliciflora is well adapted to nutrient-poor environments and requires minimal water once established."
