It is a low-growing perennial with gray-green, hairy foliage and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. It is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in coastal regions."
