    "intro": "Eupatorium anethifolium f. filifolium, commonly known as the thread-leaved boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, gray-green stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called cymes. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and are often mistaken for anise leaves. This plant thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks."
