It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
