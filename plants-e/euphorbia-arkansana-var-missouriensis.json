    "intro": "Euphorbia arkansana var. missouriensis, commonly known as Missouri pricklypear, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, branching stems and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe, though the plant itself is often avoided due to its sharp spines. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. This species is also known for its ability to withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in various ecological settings."
