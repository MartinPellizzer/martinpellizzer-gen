It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique feature of having small, eye-like spots on its leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Elaphoglossum oculatum is typically epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks, and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth."
