It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered spore sacs on the underside of its fronds, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Elaphoglossum siliquoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
