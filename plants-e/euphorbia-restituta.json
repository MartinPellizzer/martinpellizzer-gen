    "intro": "Euphorbia restituta, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has the remarkable ability to survive extreme drought by entering a state of desiccation, appearing dead but reviving when water becomes available. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss. Euphorbia restituta is often cultivated for its resilience and unique appearance in arid environments."
