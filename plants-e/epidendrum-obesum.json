It features a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often in clusters. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted for water retention. It is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
