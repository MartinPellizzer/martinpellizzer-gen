    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. sandbergii, commonly known as sandberg's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. It has hairy, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is an important food source for native pollinators and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
