    "intro": "Epicarpurus asper, commonly known as the rough epidermis plant, is a rare species characterized by its thick, textured outer layer. The plant features a woody stem with a rough, scaly epicarp, which provides structural support and protection. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring. This plant is native to specific regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
