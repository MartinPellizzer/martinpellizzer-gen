    "intro": "Elymus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Elymus multiflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife."
