    "intro": "Eragrostis vulgaris subsp. major, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and fine, blue-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in prairies and disturbed soils. Buffalo grass is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in low-maintenance lawns and restoration projects."
