    "intro": "Euphorbia sera-comans, commonly known as the pale spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with upright, spiny leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
