    "intro": "Erisma megalophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf erisma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stem, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Erisma megalophyllum is often found in meadows and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
