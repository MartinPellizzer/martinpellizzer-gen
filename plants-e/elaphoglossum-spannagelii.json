    "intro": "Elaphoglossum spannagelii, commonly known as the Spennagel's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which contribute to its unique appearance. Elaphoglossum spannagelii thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it a common sight in forest understories."
