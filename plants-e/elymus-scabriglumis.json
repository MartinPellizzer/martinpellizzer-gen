    "intro": "Elymus scabriglumis, commonly known as rough beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its stiff, hairy leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in arid environments. Elymus scabriglumis is adapted to withstand drought and grazing, contributing to its resilience in harsh conditions."
