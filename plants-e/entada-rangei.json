    "intro": "Entada rangei, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces long, pod-like fruits that contain hard, angular seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
