    "intro": "Echinorebutia, commonly known as the \"Easter cactus,\" is a type of cactus native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the spring and summer months. Echinorebutia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
