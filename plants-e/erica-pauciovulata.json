    "intro": "Erica pauciovulata, commonly known as the few-fruited heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple during the summer months. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden. Erica pauciovulata is well suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and drought conditions."
