    "intro": "Euphorbia caput-medusae var. major, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a striking succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height, with a distinctive crown-like arrangement of branches. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. This plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
