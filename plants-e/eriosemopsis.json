It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant features dense, woolly hairs on its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Eriosemopsis produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
