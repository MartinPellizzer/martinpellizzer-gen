It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought."
