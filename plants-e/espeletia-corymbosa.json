    "intro": "Espeletia corymbosa, commonly known as the \"Puya raimondii\" or the \"Queen of the Andes,\" is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of numerous violet-blue flowers. The plant is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of the Andean mountains, with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. It produces a single bloom that lasts for several weeks, after which it dies, making each flowering event a rare and significant occurrence. Espeletia corymbosa plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
