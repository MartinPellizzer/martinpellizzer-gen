    "intro": "Euphorbia lurida, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and small, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia lurida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
