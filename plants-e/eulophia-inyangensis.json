    "intro": "Eulophia inyangensis, commonly known as the Inyangensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to East Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structures. The plant typically produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Eulophia inyangensis thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
