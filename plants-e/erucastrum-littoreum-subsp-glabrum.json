    "intro": "Erucastrum littoreum subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth sea rocket, is a coastal plant native to the shores of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its glabrous (hairless) leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tidal zones where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its structure is low-growing, with a rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that rises from the center. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
