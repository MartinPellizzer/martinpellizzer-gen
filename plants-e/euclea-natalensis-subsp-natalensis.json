    "intro": "Euclea natalensis subsp. natalensis, commonly known as Natal ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, grey-barked trunk. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
