    "intro": "Eria cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, or green. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. It is often found in forest understories or along stream banks, where it forms dense mats. Eria cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
