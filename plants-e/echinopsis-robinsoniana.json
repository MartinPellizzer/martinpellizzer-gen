    "intro": "Echinopsis robinsoniana, commonly known as the Robinson's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, globose spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
