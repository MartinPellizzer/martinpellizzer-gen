    "intro": "Eupatorium killipii, commonly known as Killip's boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, woodland habitats. Eupatorium killipii is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas, thriving in rich, organic soils."
