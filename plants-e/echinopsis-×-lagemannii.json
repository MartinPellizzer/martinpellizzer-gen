    "intro": "Echinopsis \u00d7 lagemannii, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Echinopsis chubutensis and Echinopsis viridiflora. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed, succulent stems and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and gardeners."
