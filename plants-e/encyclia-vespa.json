    "intro": "Encyclia vespa, commonly known as the wasp orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, wasp-like appearance, with dark green leaves and a striking, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with a contrasting purple or brown lip, which helps in attracting specific pollinators. Encyclia vespa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
