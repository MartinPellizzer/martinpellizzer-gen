    "intro": "Elettaria, commonly known as cardamom, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is cultivated for its aromatic seeds, which are used as a spice. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The seeds, enclosed in three ovary chambers, are harvested when mature and dried for use. Elettaria thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil for optimal growth."
