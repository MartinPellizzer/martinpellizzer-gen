    "intro": "Echinocactus grandis subsp. polycormus, commonly known as the Mexican giant cactus, is a large, columnar cactus native to the dry regions of Mexico. It features a thick, ribbed stem with prominent areoles that bear spines and flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem and having a slow growth rate. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
