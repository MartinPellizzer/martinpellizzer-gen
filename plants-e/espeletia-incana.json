    "intro": "Espeletia incana, commonly known as the \"Quebracho blanco,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy capitula composed of numerous small white to pale yellow florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its structure is often mistaken for a tree due to its upright, branching form and woody base. Espeletia incana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
