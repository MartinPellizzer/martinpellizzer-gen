    "intro": "Eucalyptus camaldulensis var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf river gum, is a tall, slender tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The tree produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and greyish, peeling in thin layers as the tree matures. This variety is well adapted to riparian environments and is often found along watercourses in southern and eastern Australia."
