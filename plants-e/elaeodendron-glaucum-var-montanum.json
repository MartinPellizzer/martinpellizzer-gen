    "intro": "[WRONG START] Elaeidendron glaucum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain bluebush, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and blue-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Elaeodendron glaucum var. montanum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
