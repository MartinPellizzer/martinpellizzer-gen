    "intro": "Elaphoglossum aureonitens, commonly known as the golden-furred hawksbeard, is a small fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum aureonitens is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
