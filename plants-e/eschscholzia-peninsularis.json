    "intro": "Eschscholzia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular poppy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a distinctive yellow center, typical of the Papaveraceae family. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, brown seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
