    "intro": "Euphorbia beckii, commonly known as the Beck's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with a crown of fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
