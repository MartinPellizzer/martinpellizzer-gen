    "intro": "Eriophyllum multicaule, commonly known as the common woolly sunflower, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its soft, white to grayish foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and sand dune habitats. Eriophyllum multicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators."
