    "intro": "Eucalyptus tereticornis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallees, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, spherical flower buds that turn from green to red as they mature. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in strips, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat."
