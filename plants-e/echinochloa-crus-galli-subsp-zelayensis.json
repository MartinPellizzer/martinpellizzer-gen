    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli subsp. zelayensis, commonly known as yellow foxtail, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that often appear yellowish-green. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and have a prominent midrib, while the seed heads are loosely arranged. This subspecies is an annual weed with a rapid growth cycle, making it a common challenge in crops like corn and wheat."
