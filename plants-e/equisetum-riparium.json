It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found near water bodies. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
