    "intro": "Erophila stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited erophila, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by narrow, cylindrical fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. Erophila stenocarpa is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal sands."
