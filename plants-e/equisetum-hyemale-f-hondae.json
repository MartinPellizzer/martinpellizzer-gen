It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems that are typically green and covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are distinct from the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
