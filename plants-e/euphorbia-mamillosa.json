    "intro": "Euphorbia mamillosa, commonly known as the Wooly Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Euphorbia mamillosa is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
