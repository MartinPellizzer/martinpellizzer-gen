    "intro": "Epidendrum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Epidendrum serrulatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
