    "intro": "Eriogonum fruticosum var. glutinosum, commonly known as stickyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are often coated with a sticky, glandular substance, which gives the plant its common name. This variant is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
