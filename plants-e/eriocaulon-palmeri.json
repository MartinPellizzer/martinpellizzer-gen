    "intro": "Eriocaulon palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's bulbous grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact, bulb-like base and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils or along dry streambeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of multiple spikelets that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. Eriocaulon palmeri is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
