    "intro": "Epipactis atropurpurea var. majoriflora, commonly known as the purple marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It features dark purple to brownish flowers with a distinctive lip that is often lighter in color. The plant has a tall, erect stem with several leaves and can grow up to 60 cm in height. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, typical of its wetland habitat. This orchid is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
