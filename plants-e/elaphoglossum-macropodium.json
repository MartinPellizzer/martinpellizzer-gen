    "intro": "Elaphoglossum macropodium, commonly known as the large-veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, and is often found in humid, tropical climates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with prominent veins that give it its common name."
