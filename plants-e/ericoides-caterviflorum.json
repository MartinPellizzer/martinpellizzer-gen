    "intro": "Ericoides caterviflorum, commonly known as the clustered flower heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or heathland environments. Ericoides caterviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
