    "intro": "Eleocharis debilis, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Due to its delicate appearance and preference for moist habitats, it is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
