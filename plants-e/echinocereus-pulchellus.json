    "intro": "Echinocereus pulchellus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a slow-growing, solitary cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often develops a rounded, barrel-like shape. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow to orange spines and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Echinocereus pulchellus is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stem, making it highly drought-tolerant."
