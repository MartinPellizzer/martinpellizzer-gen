It is characterized by its large, showy, wax-like flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
