    "intro": "Epipactis nephrocordia, commonly known as the kidney-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, kidney-shaped leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Epipactis nephrocordia is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
