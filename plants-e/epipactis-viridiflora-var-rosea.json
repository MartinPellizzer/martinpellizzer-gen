    "intro": "Epipactis viridiflora var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered green orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and its distinctive pink to rose-colored flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, thriving in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are adorned with intricate patterns and have a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
