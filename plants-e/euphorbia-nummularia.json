    "intro": "Euphorbia nummularia, commonly known as the silver rose or white spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures containing yellowish-green flowers, typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
