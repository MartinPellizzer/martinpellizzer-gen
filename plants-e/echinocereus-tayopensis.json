    "intro": "Echinocereus tayopensis, commonly known as the Texas nightblooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its flowers typically open in the evening and remain open through the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. This species is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive prolonged droughts."
