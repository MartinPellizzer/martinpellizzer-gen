    "intro": "Elaphoglossum preslianum, commonly known as the Preslia's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically arching or ascending in growth habit. The plant produces spores in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Elaphoglossum preslianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
