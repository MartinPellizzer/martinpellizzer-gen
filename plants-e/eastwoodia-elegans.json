    "intro": "Eastwoodia elegans, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Eastwoodia elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
