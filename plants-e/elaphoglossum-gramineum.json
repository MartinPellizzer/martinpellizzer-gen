    "intro": "Elaphoglossum gramineum, commonly known as the grass fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its simple, linear leaves and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
