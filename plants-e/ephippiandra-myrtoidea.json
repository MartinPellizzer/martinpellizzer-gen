    "intro": "Ephippiandra myrtoidea, commonly known as the silver leaf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Ephippiandra myrtoidea is well adapted to saline and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
