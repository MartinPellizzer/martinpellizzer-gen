    "intro": "Echinopsis cajasensis, commonly known as the Cajas moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its swollen, spherical stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers during the warmer months, typically in the evening. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted for dry conditions. Echinopsis cajasensis is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
