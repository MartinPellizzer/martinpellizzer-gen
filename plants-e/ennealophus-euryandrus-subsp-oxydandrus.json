    "intro": "Ennealophus euryandrus subsp. oxydandrus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific rocky habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered spores rather than flowers, which is a defining feature of its fern classification. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
