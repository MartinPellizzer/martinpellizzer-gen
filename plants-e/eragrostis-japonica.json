It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
