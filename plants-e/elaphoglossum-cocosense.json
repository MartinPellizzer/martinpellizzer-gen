    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cocosense, commonly known as the coconut fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety coating, which helps in water retention. Elaphoglossum cocosense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
