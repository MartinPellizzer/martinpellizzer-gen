    "intro": "Eugenia manonae, commonly known as the Manonae myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruits are small, berry-like drupes that are edible and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eugenia manonae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
