    "intro": "Epidendrum haseltonianum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically broad and green, often with a waxy coating to help retain moisture. Epidendrum haseltonianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
