    "intro": "Euphorbia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia umbrosa is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
