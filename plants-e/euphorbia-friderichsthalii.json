    "intro": "Euphorbia friderichsthalii, commonly known as the Taita euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It is characterized by its branching stems and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and succulent enthusiasts."
