    "intro": "Euryops proteoides, commonly known as the golden bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces bright yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grey-green, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Euryops proteoides is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
