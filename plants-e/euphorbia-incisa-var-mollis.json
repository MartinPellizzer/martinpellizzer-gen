    "intro": "Euphorbia incisa var. mollis, commonly known as the softleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
