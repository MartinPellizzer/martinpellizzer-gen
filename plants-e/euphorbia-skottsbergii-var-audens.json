    "intro": "Euphorbia skottsbergii var. audens, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
