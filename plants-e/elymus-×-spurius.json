    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 spurius, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus \u00d7 spurius is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its resilience and ability to thrive in marginal environments make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
