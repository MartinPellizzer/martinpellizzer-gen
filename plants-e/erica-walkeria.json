    "intro": "Erica walkeria, commonly known as the coastal heath or dwarf heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. Erica walkeria thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
