It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically features strap-like leaves and can grow up to several meters in height. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum goebelii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
