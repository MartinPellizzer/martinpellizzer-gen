    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudopetiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
