    "intro": "Erica herbacea var. alba, commonly known as the white heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are predominantly white, often with a slight pink or pale yellow tint. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, hardy ground cover in suitable climates."
