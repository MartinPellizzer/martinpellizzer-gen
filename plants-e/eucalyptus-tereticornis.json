    "intro": "Eucalyptus tereticornis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a tall, hardy tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The species is also valued for its timber and has been introduced to other regions for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
