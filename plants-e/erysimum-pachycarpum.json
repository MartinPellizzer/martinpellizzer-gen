    "intro": "Erysimum pachycarpum, commonly known as the thick-fruited wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its thick, fleshy fruits are an adaptation to arid environments, allowing it to store water. Erysimum pachycarpum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, dry climates."
