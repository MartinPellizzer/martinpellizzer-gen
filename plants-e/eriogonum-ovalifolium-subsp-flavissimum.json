    "intro": "Eriogonum ovalifolium subsp. flavissimum, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are oval in shape, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
