    "intro": "Elaphoglossum robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The fronds are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive harts-tongue shape at the base, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the understory of forests."
