    "intro": "Empetrum procumbens, commonly known as dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically reddish in color and remain throughout the year. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in poor, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or barren areas. Empetrum procumbens is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate extreme environmental conditions."
