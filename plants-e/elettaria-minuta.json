    "intro": "Elettaria minuta, commonly known as lesser cardamom, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces tiny, blackish seeds that are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its medicinal properties. Elettaria minuta is closely related to the more well-known cardamom species, but it is smaller in size and has a milder aroma."
