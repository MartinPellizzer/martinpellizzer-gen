    "intro": "Euphorbia cuneata subsp. lamproderma, commonly known as the red-stemmed spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care, and it is often used in xeriscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
