    "intro": "Epipactis albensis subsp. lusatia, commonly known as the Lusatian helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and a striking, showy flower spike with white to pale green blossoms. The plant is terrestrial, growing in moist, shaded woodlands and often forming dense colonies. It has a complex life cycle, requiring specific mycorrhizal fungi for germination and nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
