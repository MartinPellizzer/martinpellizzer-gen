    "intro": "Eriogonum ovalifolium subsp. typicum, commonly known as the typical oval-leaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is often found in sagebrush steppe and open woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its region."
