    "intro": "Euphorbia longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled spurge, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are elongated with a distinct petiole, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
