    "intro": "Euonymus euphlebiphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter beneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, inflated seed capsules that split open to release seeds. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
