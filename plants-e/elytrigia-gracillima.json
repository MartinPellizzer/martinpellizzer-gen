    "intro": "Elytrigia gracillima, commonly known as slender basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, loamy conditions. The plant features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Elytrigia gracillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
