    "intro": "Erica vesicaria, commonly known as the bladder heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western and southern regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, dense clusters of needle-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is highly drought-tolerant and well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range. Erica vesicaria is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
