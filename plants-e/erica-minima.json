    "intro": "Erica minima, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western coast of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Erica minima is often found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
