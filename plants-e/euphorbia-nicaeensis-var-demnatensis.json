    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis var. demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnat's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in rocky, coastal habitats."
