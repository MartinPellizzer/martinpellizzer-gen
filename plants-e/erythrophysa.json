    "intro": "Erythrophysa, commonly known as the red-leafed spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, bright red leaves that contrast with its green stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Erythrophysa is native to parts of Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
