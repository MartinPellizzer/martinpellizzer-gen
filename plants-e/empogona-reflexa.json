It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with five sepals and five petals, often with a red or orange hue. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically green when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Empogona reflexa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
