    "intro": "Eriospermum rhizomatum, commonly known as the African daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pink petals, blooming from spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. Eriospermum rhizomatum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
