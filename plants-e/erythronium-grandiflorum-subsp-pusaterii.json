    "intro": "Erythronium grandiflorum subsp. pusaterii, commonly known as the Siberian dog-tooth violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a bulbous underground stem, which stores nutrients and supports growth during dormant periods. The plant produces showy, nodding flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically emerging in early spring. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and form a rosette near the base of the plant. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
