    "intro": "Escobariopsis prolifera subsp. zublerae, commonly known as the Zuber's cushion moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant features small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying liverwort diversity and adaptation."
