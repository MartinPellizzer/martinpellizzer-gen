It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with white petals and a yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a threatened species in the wild."
