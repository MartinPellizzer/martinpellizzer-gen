    "intro": "Euphorbia lutulenta, commonly known as the sticky euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, making handling it require caution. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities."
