    "intro": "Euphorbia tithymaloides subsp. tithymaloides, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
