    "intro": "Enneapogon oblongus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Enneapogon oblongus is drought-tolerant and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
