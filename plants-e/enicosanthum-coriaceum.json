    "intro": "Enicosanthum coriaceum, commonly known as the thick-leaved enicosanthum, is a unique plant species characterized by its robust, leathery foliage. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features a compact growth habit with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss and conserve moisture. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
