    "intro": "Echites paludosus, commonly known as swamp bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects. The plant thrives in shallow, still water with abundant sunlight. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its stems may extend above the water surface. Echites paludosus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
