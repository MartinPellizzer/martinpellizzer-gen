    "intro": "Eulophia subulata, commonly known as the slender spike orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces upright spikes of small, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Eulophia subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
