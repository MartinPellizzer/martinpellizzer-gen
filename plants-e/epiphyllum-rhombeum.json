    "intro": "Epiphyllum rhombeum, commonly known as the rose of Jericho, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the evening. Epiphyllum rhombeum is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its unique appearance and blooming behavior make it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
