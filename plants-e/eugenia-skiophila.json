    "intro": "Eugenia skiophila, commonly known as the cloud forest eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. It produces small, smooth, yellowish fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss, Eugenia skiophila is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
