It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and related plants. The plant is characterized by its striking red and orange inflorescences, which resemble torches, hence its common name. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Etlingera corneri is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its potential use in traditional medicine."
