It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that displays a distinctive red or pinkish hue, especially when exposed to sunlight. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-gray appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
