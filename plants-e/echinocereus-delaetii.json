    "intro": "Echinocereus delaetii, commonly known as the Delaet's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial cactus with a cylindrical stem that produces spiny, segmented stems covered in white to yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and bats. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
