    "intro": "Eriodes, commonly known as the \"flossflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their fluffy, cotton-like flower heads, which consist of numerous small, scale-like bracts. Eriodes species are native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. They typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, often with hairy stems and leaves. The genus includes several species, such as Eriodes ciliatus and Eriodes parviflorus, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in their native habitats."
