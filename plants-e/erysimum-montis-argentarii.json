    "intro": "Erysimum montis-argentarii, commonly known as the silver mountain mustard, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Pyrenees. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy member of the Brassicaceae family. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
