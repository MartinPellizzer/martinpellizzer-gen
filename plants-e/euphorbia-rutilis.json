    "intro": "Euphorbia rutilis, commonly known as the sunset spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble small sunbursts. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, which serves as a natural defense mechanism. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a distinctive addition to arid landscapes."
