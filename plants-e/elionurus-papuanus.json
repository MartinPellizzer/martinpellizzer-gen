It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in inflorescences. Elionurus papuanus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
