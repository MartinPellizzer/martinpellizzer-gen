    "intro": "Eragrostis vacillans, commonly known as variable grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the southern United States and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open areas such as fields and disturbed sites. Eragrostis vacillans is typically herbaceous, with a short lifespan and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability."
