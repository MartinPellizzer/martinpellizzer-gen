It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and sparse, spiny leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
