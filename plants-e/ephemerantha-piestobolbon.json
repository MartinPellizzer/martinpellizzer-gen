    "intro": "Ephemerantha piestobolbon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and a single, showy white flower. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its specialized leaves, which are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Ephemerantha piestobolbon is considered a conservation concern."
