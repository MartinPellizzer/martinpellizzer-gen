    "intro": "Eugenia corticosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery bloom, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, bright red berries. Eugenia corticosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest areas."
