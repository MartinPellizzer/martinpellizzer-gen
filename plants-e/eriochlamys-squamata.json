    "intro": "Eriochlamys squamata, commonly known as the scaly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive scaly appearance, particularly on the stems and leaves. Eriochlamys squamata is often found in disturbed soils and can serve as an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
