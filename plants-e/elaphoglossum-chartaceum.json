    "intro": "Elaphoglossum chartaceum, commonly known as the paper fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a thin, papery layer, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually over time. Elaphoglossum chartaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
