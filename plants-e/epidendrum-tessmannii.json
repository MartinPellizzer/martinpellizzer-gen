    "intro": "Epidendrum tessmannii, commonly known as the Tessmann's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum tessmannii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a tropical garden setting."
