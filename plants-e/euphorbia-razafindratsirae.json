    "intro": "Euphorbia razafindratsirae, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the island's arid conditions. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it produces a milky sap that is common in the genus Euphorbia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
