    "intro": "Eschweilera laevicarpa, commonly known as the smooth-shelled eschweilera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, white to pale pink flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for various animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
