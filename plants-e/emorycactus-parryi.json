    "intro": "Emorycactus parryi, commonly known as the Parry's cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, spiny stem and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its spines are modified leaves that provide shade and protection from herbivores. Emorycactus parryi is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
