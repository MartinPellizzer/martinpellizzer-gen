    "intro": "Elegia altigena, commonly known as the giant water flea, is a freshwater zooplankton, not a plant, and therefore does not have botanical aspects. It belongs to the order Cyclopoida and is characterized by its small, translucent body and long antennae. This organism plays a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems as both a predator and prey. It is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Due to its ecological significance, it is an important indicator species for water quality."
