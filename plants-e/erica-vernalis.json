    "intro": "Erica vernalis, commonly known as the spring heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces showy clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and rocky slopes. Erica vernalis is adapted to coastal climates and is resistant to salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
