    "intro": "Euphorbia fendleri var. typica, commonly known as the Desert Globemallow, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in dry regions."
