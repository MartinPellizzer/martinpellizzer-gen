    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli, commonly known as cocklegrass, is an annual grass species native to temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and spikelet clusters that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as fields, roadsides, and agricultural areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle. Cocklegrass is considered a weed in many crops but is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock."
