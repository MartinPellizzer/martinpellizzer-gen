    "intro": "Eugenia suffrutescens var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in short peduncles, giving it its specific epithet \"brevipedunculata.\" These flowers are followed by small, round berries that are edible and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
