    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudonutans, commonly known as the candle plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, candle-like stem that is often covered in a waxy, white coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a unique appearance. Euphorbia pseudonutans is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
