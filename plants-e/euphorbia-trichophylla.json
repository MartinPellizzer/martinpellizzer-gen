    "intro": "Euphorbia trichophylla, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Euphorbia trichophylla contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
