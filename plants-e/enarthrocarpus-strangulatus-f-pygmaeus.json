    "intro": "Enarthrocarpus strangulatus f. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf strangler fig, is a unique variant of the strangler fig species. It is a climbing plant that typically starts its life as an epiphyte, growing on the branches of host trees. As it matures, it sends down aerial roots that encircle the host, eventually leading to its suffocation. The plant's botanical features include its fibrous roots and its ability to form a dense canopy. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and edible figs."
