    "intro": "Eria cordifera subsp. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean heart-leaf orchid, is a species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, pendulous inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near the forest floor. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
