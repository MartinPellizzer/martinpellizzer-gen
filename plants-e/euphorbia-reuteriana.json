    "intro": "Euphorbia reuteriana, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in dense, white to grayish hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
