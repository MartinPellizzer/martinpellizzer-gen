    "intro": "Eucalyptus viridis, commonly known as the green eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually bright green. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is commonly found in coastal and dry inland areas. Eucalyptus viridis is also known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
