    "intro": "Echinocactus stenocarpus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, ribbed structure, which helps it store water efficiently. The plant features a dense covering of spines, which protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the plant during the warmer months. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
