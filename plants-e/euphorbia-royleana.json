    "intro": "Euphorbia royleana, commonly known as the Indian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and a lack of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its thick, green stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic milky sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution."
