It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, blueish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. Eupatorium hartwegii is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
