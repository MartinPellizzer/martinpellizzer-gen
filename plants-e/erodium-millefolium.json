    "intro": "Erodium millefolium, commonly known as common erodium, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pink or purple flowers and finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
