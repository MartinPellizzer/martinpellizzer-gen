    "intro": "Eschweilera rimbachii, commonly known as the Rimbach's evergreen. It is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest, characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that matures to a dark purple color. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
