    "intro": "Epidendrum pterogastrium, commonly known as the Violet Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically features dark green, strap-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum pterogastrium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
