    "intro": "Epistephium duckei, commonly known as the Ducke's epistephium, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Epistephium duckei is known for its limited distribution and is often found growing in shaded, humid environments. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
