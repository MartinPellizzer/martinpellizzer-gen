    "intro": "Eragrostis pilgeri subsp. ancashensis, commonly known as the Cashan panicgrass, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
