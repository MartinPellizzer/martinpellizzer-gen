It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
