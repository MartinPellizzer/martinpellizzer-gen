    "intro": "Euphorbia kelleri var. kelleri, commonly known as the Keller's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to full sun. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
