    "intro": "Euphorbia pistiifolia, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its unique structure and ability to store water make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
