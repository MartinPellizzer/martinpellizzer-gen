    "intro": "Euphorbia pachyceras, commonly known as the thick-shelled spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Euphorbia pachyceras is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
