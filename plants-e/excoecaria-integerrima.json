    "intro": "Excoecaria integerrima, commonly known as the croton tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its thick, rugged bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by orange to red berries containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. The leaves and bark contain toxic compounds, making it a plant with both ecological and medicinal significance."
