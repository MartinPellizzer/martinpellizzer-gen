    "intro": "Epidendrum cruciforme, commonly known as the Crossed Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms during the wet season and prefers bright, indirect light with high humidity. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic. The flowers have a distinctive cross-shaped pattern on the petals, giving it its common name."
