    "intro": "Epilobium dodonaei var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate willowherb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover or in rock gardens."
