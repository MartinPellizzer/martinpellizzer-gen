    "intro": "Euphorbia pedunculosa, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, possessing a deep root system and a waxy leaf surface to reduce water loss. Euphorbia pedunculosa is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritant and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
