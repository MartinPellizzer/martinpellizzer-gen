    "intro": "Erica miniscula, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring dense, compact foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica miniscula is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
