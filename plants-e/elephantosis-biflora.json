    "intro": "Elephantosis biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered elephant plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, large, bi-petal flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, known for its bell-shaped flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
