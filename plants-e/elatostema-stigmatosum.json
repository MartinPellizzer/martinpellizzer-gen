    "intro": "Elatostema stigmatosum, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a member of the Urticaceae family, characterized by its small, succulent leaves. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, sticky hairs that help retain moisture and deter herbivores. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and are arranged in clusters. Elatostema stigmatosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
