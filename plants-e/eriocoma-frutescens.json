    "intro": "Eriocoma frutescens, commonly known as the roughleaf ericaceous shrub, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
