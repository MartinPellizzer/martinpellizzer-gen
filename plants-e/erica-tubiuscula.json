    "intro": "Erica tubiuscula, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica tubiuscula thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to coastal and mountainous environments, often found in fynbos vegetation."
