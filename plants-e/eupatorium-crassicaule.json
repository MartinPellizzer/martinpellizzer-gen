    "intro": "Eupatorium crassicaule, commonly known as roughhead boneset, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features tall, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its showy, clustered flowers are usually white or pale blue, appearing in late summer to early fall. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
