    "intro": "Elymus triticoides subsp. simplex, commonly known as the simple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along streambanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
