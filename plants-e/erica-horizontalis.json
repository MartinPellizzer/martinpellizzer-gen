    "intro": "Erica horizontalis, commonly known as the evergreen heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern England and western France. It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its foliage consists of narrow, evergreen leaves that provide year-round interest. Erica horizontalis is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
