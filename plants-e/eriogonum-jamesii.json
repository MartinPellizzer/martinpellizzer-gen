    "intro": "Eriogonum jamesii, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Eriogonum jamesii is well adapted to harsh environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
