    "intro": "Elaeodendron quadrangulatum, commonly known as the four-cornered elaeodendron, is a shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in savanna and woodland areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
