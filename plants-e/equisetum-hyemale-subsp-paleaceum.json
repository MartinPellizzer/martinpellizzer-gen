    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale subsp. paleaceum, commonly known as the pale scaly horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
