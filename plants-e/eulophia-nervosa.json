It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with a distinctive veined pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its roots are often fibrous and adapted to anchor in loose soil or decomposed organic matter. Eulophia nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
