    "intro": "Elymus clivorum, commonly known as the alpine needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky slopes and meadows. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Elymus clivorum is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude environments."
