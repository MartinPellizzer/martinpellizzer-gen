    "intro": "Eriophorum vaginatum f. erubescens, commonly known as the red-stalked cotton grass, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive pinkish-red stems. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is native to Arctic and alpine regions. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in its harsh environment. Its bright coloration helps it stand out in the tundra, aiding in pollination and seed dispersal. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny flowers, typical of the genus Eriophorum."
