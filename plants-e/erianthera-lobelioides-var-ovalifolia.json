    "intro": "Erianthera lobelioides var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved flame violet, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and clusters of small, showy, violet-colored flowers. The leaves are typically oval-shaped, hence the variety name, and are arranged oppositely along the stem. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
