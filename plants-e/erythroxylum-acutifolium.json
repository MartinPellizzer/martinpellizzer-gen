    "intro": "Erythroxylum acutifolium, commonly known as the acute-leaved erythroxylum, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, acute leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by small, oval-shaped berries. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it is not related to the coca plant, despite the similar genus name."
