    "intro": "Encyclia viridiflava, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with yellow markings, which bloom during the wet season. Encyclia viridiflava is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
