    "intro": "Euphorbia gemella, commonly known as the dwarf crown-of-thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its fleshy stems. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscapes."
