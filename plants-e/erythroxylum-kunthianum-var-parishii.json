    "intro": "Erythroxylum kunthianum var. parishii, commonly known as the Paraguay coca, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Paraguay and northern Argentina. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition into orange-red berries containing oval seeds. It is notable for its chemical composition, containing alkaloids such as cocaine, though it is less commonly cultivated for this purpose compared to other Erythroxylum species."
