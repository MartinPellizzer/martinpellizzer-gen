It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its roots are often adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks or branches. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
