    "intro": "Encyclia amicta, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces long, pendulous inflorescences. Encyclia amicta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in suitable conditions."
