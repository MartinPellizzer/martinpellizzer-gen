    "intro": "Eugenia viscacea, commonly known as the sticky eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. Eugenia viscacea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
