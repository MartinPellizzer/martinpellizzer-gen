    "intro": "Euphorbia eremica, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia eremica is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its stems to withstand prolonged drought. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
