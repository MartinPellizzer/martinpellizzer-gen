    "intro": "Eriophorum latifolium var. congestum, commonly known as the clustered cotton grass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton balls, which are composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or heathland environments. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain heat in cold climates."
