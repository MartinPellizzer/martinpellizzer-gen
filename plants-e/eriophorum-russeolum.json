    "intro": "Eriophorum russeolum, commonly known as the cotton grass, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are borne on slender, upright stems. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs, fens, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Eriophorum russeolum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
