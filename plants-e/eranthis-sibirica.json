    "intro": "Eranthis sibirica, commonly known as Siberian winter aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically basal. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and early-flowering addition to woodland gardens."
