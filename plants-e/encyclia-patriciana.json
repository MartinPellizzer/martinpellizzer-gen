It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting dark veins. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Encyclia patriciana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
