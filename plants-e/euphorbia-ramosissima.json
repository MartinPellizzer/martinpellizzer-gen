    "intro": "Euphorbia ramosissima, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a thick, branching stem covered in sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for humans and animals. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss in arid environments. Euphorbia ramosissima is adapted to survive in hot, dry climates with minimal water requirements."
