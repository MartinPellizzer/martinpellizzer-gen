    "intro": "Epipactis gracilis, commonly known as the slender helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single spike of pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, intricate lip. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Epipactis gracilis is known for its mycorrhizal association with fungi, which aids in nutrient uptake."
