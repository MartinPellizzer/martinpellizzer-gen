    "intro": "Euryspermum uliginosum, commonly known as the bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in peat bogs and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting biodiversity. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
