    "intro": "Epipactis salina, commonly known as the salt marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in saline soils, often found in salt marshes and dunes, where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its habitat. Due to its specialized environment, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in coastal ecosystems."
