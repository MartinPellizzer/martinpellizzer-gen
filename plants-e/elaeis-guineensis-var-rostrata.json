    "intro": "Elaeis guineensis var. rostrata, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a variant of the oil palm native to West Africa. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and tall, straight trunk that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant produces fruit bunches that contain oil-rich kernels, which are harvested for palm oil production. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a high degree of adaptability to tropical climates. This variety is economically significant due to its high yield of oil and its role in both local and global agriculture."
