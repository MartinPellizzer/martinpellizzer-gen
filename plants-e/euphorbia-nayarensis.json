    "intro": "Euphorbia nayarensis, commonly known as the Nayar Island spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
