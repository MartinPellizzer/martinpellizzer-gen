    "intro": "Epipactis phyllanthes subsp. campeadorii, commonly known as the Campeador orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred lip and a column that is typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
