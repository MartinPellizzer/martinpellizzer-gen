    "intro": "Euthamia pulverulenta, commonly known as brittleblow, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures that aid in wind dispersal. Euthamia pulverulenta is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological value and ornamental appeal."
