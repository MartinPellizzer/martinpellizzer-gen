    "intro": "Euphorbia quadrata, commonly known as the quadrangular euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, four-sided stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
