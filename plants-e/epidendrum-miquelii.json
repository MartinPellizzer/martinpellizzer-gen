    "intro": "Epidendrum miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum miquelii is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and outdoor gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
