It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are broad and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The varietal form acaule is distinguished by the absence of a distinct stem, with the leaves directly emerging from the base."
