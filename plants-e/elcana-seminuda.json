    "intro": "Elcana seminuda, commonly known as the naked elcana, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Elcana seminuda is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in rocky or alpine regions."
