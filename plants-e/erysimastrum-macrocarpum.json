    "intro": "Erysimastrum macrocarpum, commonly known as the bigleaf goldenweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped, bright green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
