It features a branched stem with clusters of small, waxy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, making it drought-tolerant. Its unique appearance, resembling a candle with multiple branches, makes it a popular ornamental plant. It is also known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun."
