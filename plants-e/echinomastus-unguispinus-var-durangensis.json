It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features spiny stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, rugged texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
