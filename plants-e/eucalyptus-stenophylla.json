    "intro": "Eucalyptus stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringybark, is a tall, slender eucalyptus tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, often greyish bark that peels in strips. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Eucalyptus stenophylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
