It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Epidendrum hypoleptum prefers warm temperatures and high humidity for optimal growth and flowering."
