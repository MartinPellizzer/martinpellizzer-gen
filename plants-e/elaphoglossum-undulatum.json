    "intro": "Elaphoglossum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are often adorned with a wavy or undulating margin. Native to the temperate regions of the Americas, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically smaller and more compact than the sterile fronds."
