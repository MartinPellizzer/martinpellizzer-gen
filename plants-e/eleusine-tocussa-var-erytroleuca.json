It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Eleusine. The plant typically grows in open areas, such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and prefers full sun exposure. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
