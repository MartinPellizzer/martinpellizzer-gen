    "intro": "Ericoides adenostomum, commonly known as the narrowleaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its compact appearance. The plant produces bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Ericoides adenostomum is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
