    "intro": "Esula amygdaloides, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by the development of sweet, oily nuts. Its fruit is encased in a hard shell and contains a rich, edible kernel. Esula amygdaloides is valued for its ornamental beauty and economic importance in the production of edible oils and cosmetics."
