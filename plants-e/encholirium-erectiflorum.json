    "intro": "Encholirium erectiflorum, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and vibrant red-orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emerge from the base of the bracts, adding a contrasting touch to its showy display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
