    "intro": "Excremis scabra, commonly known as the rough-stemmed flax, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, angular stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. Its fibrous stems are valued for their industrial applications, similar to traditional flax. Excremis scabra thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands."
