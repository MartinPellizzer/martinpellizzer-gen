    "intro": "Euonymus fimbriatus, commonly known as the fringed spurge or red-leaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often adorned with white or yellow marginal veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Euonymus fimbriatus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban environments."
