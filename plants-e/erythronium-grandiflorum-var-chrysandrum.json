The plant features strap-like leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, typically emerging in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological value in natural habitats."
