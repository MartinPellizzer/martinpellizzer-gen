    "intro": "Epilepis, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of evergreen, spore-bearing plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and their ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Epilepis species typically grow in dense mats or low shrubs, often found in temperate and tropical regions. They play a significant role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms. The reproductive structures of Epilepis, known as strobila, contain the spores necessary for its propagation."
