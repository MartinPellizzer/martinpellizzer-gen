    "intro": "Elaeagnus parvifolia var. nuda, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, scale-like hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by edible, red-orange berries that are rich in nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique appearance and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
