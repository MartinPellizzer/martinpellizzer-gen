    "intro": "Eremocarya, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. Eremocarya species are characterized by their hairy, often glandular leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. They typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in dry gardens."
