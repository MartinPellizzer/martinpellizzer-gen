    "intro": "Eurya japonica f. linearifolia, commonly known as the Japanese waxleaf eurya, is a compact evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Native to East Asia, this plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small spaces and container gardening."
