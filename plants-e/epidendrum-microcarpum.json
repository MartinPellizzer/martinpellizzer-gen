    "intro": "Epidendrum microcarpum, commonly known as the miniature seedpod orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a slight greenish tinge. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees or other plants rather than in soil. Epidendrum microcarpum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
