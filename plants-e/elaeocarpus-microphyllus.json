    "intro": "Elaeocarpus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf elaeocarp, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves that are relatively small in size. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
