    "intro": "Eucalyptus alipes, commonly known as the slender gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and white. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib, and they are often aromatic when crushed. Eucalyptus alipes is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
