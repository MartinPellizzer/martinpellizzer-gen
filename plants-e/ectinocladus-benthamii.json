    "intro": "Ectinocladus benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for leaves but are actually modified stems. The plant produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species in maritime ecosystems."
