    "intro": "Evosmia, commonly known as the night-scented flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their aromatic, often fragrant flowers that release their scent at night. Evosmia species typically have small, white or pale-colored flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the plants often grow in moist, shady environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental beauty and unique fragrance."
