    "intro": "Elisanthe scouleri, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at higher elevations. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters near the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Elisanthe scouleri plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, mountainous habitat."
