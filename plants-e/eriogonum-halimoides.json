    "intro": "Eriogonum halimoides, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across open landscapes. Eriogonum halimoides is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, dunes, and dry fields."
