    "intro": "Erodium bipinnatum var. huguetii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its flowers bloom from spring to early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. The species is often found in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
