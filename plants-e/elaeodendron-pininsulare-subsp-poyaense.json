    "intro": "Elaeodendron pininsulare subsp. poyaense, commonly known as the Poya's elaeodendron, is a rare endemic plant found primarily in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow in color, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
