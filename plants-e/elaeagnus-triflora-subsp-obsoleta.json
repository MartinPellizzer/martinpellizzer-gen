It is characterized by its silvery foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The subspecies obsoleta is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Elaeagnus triflora."
