    "intro": "Echinops, commonly known as the thistle or globe thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, giving them their common name. Echinops species are typically found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. They produce small, usually yellow or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
