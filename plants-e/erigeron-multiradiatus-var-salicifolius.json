It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, willow-like leaves and produces fluffy, white to pale yellow flower heads that bloom in summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators and as a component of native plant communities."
