    "intro": "Euphorbia aspericaulis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in rough, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its fleshy stems. Due to its spiny and sometimes toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
