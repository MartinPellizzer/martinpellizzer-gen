It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing delicate, pale green to blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and dry environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens and restoration projects."
