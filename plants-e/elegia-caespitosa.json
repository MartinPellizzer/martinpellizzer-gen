    "intro": "Elegia caespitosa, commonly known as tufted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open areas. Elegia caespitosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
