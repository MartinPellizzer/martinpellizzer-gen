    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 alsaticum, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale. It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures called enations, which are used for photosynthesis. This plant is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica."
