It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like white flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. Erigeron poliospermus typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
