    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. torreyanum, commonly known as the Torrey's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and woodland edges. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. This species is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
