    "intro": "Eragrostis frederici, commonly known as coastal lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray coloration that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in coastal areas with high salinity and strong winds."
