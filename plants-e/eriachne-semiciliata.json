    "intro": "Eriachne semiciliata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions. Eriachne semiciliata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
