    "intro": "Elaphoglossum oxyglossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in distinct groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Elaphoglossum oxyglossum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
