    "intro": "Echinospermum diploloma, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flower heads that resemble sunflowers, with numerous small florets arranged in a composite structure. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, echinoid (spiky) capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Echinospermum diploloma is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
