    "intro": "Ericoides tetragonum, commonly known as the four-sided heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Ericoides tetragonum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
