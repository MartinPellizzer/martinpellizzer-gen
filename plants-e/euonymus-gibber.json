    "intro": "Euonymus gibber, commonly known as the woolly euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a pale green color with a fuzzy texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
