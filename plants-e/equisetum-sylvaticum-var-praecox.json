    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum var. praecox, commonly known as early marsh horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the top of the stems, which are often covered in a layer of sterile leaves. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
