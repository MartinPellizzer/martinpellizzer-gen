    "intro": "Ericoides flammeum, commonly known as the flame heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, compact foliage with bright red or orange bracts that resemble flames, giving it its striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer. Ericoides flammeum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. It is valued for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, hardy ground cover in rocky or alpine settings."
