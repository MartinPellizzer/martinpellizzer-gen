    "intro": "Euphorbia tortistyla, commonly known as the twisted-stem euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, twisted stems that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its striking form and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and collections."
