    "intro": "Eucalyptus rudis, commonly known as the slender ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that ranges from grey to white in color. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically measuring up to 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry climates."
