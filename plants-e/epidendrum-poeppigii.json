    "intro": "Epidendrum poeppigii, commonly known as the Poeppig's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum poeppigii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
