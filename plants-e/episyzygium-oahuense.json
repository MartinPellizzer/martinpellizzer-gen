    "intro": "Episyzygium oahuense, commonly known as the Oahu sandalwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and is typically found in coastal sand dune habitats. The plant has a unique ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts. Its wood was historically valued for its aromatic properties, though its use has been significantly reduced in modern times."
