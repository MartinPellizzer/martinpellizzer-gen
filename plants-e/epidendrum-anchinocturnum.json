    "intro": "Epidendrum anchinocturnum, commonly known as the night-blooming epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that open at night and close by morning, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. The flowers are usually pale green to white with a deep purple or violet lip, making it a visually distinctive species within the Epidendrum genus."
