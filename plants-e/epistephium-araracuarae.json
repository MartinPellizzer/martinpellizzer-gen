    "intro": "Epistephium araracuarae, commonly known as the Araracuara epistephium, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Its botanical features include small, inconspicuous flowers and a short, stout stem. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to extinction."
