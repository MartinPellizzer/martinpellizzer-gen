    "intro": "Erythropogon umbellatus, commonly known as the red grass or red panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, reddish tuffs of foliage that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, umbrella-like cluster of spikelets, which is a distinguishing feature. Erythropogon umbellatus is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
