    "intro": "Evoista, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that appear to shimmer with an otherworldly glow, especially under moonlight. The plant's flowers open only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators. Evoista has a complex root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, and it is believed to have medicinal properties in traditional Malagasy medicine. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
