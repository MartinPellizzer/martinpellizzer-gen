    "intro": "Eragrostis purshii var. miserrina, commonly known as the narrowleaf bearded grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
