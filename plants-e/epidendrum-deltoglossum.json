    "intro": "Epidendrum deltoglossum, commonly known as the yellow-tipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically has strap-like leaves that are dark green and somewhat succulent. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum deltoglossum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
