    "intro": "Euphorbiopsis, commonly known as the false spurge or euphorbiopsis, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Many species of Euphorbiopsis are shrubs or small trees, and some have milky sap that can be toxic. They are often found in moist, shaded environments and are valued for their ornamental qualities in horticulture."
