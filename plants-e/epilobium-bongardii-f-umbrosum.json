    "intro": "Epilobium bongardii f. umbrosum, commonly known as the shade-loving willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, usually pink or purple flowers clustered in terminal racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring rich, loamy soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and native garden landscapes."
