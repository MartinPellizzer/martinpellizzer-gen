    "intro": "Erigeron tasmanicus var. stellatus, commonly known as the Tasmanian fleur-de-lis, is a flowering plant native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple daisy-like flowers with white centers, which bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands. It is a perennial herb that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
