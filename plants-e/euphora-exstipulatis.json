    "intro": "Euphora exstipulatis, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are distinctive cup-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Euphora exstipulatis is a perennial herb that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in arid environments."
