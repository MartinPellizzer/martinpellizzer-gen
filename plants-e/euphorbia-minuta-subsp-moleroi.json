    "intro": "Euphorbia minuta subsp. moleroi, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a succulent shrub native to parts of Mexico. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid climates."
