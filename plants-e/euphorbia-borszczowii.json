    "intro": "Euphorbia borszczowii, commonly known as the Borszczowii spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features succulent, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, so caution is advised when handling it. Euphorbia borszczowii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
