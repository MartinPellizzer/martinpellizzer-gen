    "intro": "Euphorbia australis var. erythrantha, commonly known as the red-flowered spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces striking red-orange cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures. The plant has smooth, often greyish-green stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry garden environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in ornamental landscaping."
