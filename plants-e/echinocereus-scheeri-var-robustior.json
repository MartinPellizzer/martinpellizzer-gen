    "intro": "Echinocereus scheeri var. robustior, commonly known as the robust desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
