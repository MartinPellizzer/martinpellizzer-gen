It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Epibaterium tomentosum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
