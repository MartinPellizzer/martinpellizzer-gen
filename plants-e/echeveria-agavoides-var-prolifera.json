The plant produces vibrant pink to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, branching stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its striking color and ease of care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container plantings."
