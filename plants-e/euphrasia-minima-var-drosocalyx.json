    "intro": "Euphrasia minima var. drosocalyx, commonly known as the small sandwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and features small, delicate flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes or rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
