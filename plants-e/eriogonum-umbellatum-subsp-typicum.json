    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the common buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
