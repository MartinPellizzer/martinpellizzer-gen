    "intro": "Endiandra reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated endiandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, reticulated leaf patterns. The plant typically grows in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
