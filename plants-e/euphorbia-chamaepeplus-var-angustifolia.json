    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaepeplus var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, angular stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and typically have a waxy texture with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
