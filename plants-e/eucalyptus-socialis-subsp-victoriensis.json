    "intro": "Eucalyptus socialis subsp. victoriensis, commonly known as the Victorian box gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pale pink flowers, typically in spring. It is adapted to a range of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open forests and woodland habitats. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in the region."
