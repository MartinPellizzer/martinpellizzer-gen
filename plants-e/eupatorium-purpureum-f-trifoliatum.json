    "intro": "Eupatorium purpureum f. trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved purple boneset, is a variant of the purple boneset plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its showy, purple-tinged flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its botanical features include opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
