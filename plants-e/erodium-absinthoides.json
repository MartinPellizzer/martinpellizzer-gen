    "intro": "Erodium absinthoides, commonly known as field sandparsley, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and numerous, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. The plant is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open, sunny habitats."
