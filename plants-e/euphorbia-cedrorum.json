    "intro": "Euphorbia cedrorum, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its succulent, upright stems and small, clustered yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among species in the Euphorbiaceae family. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions. Euphorbia cedrorum is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
