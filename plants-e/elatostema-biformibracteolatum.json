It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Elatostema biformibracteolatum is notable for its unique bract structure, which resembles two small leaves at the base of each flower cluster."
