    "intro": "Euphorbia soongarica, commonly known as the Karakum euphorbia, is a spiny, succulent shrub native to Central Asia. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions. Its spines provide protection from herbivores, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
