    "intro": "Eutrema wasabi f. terrestre, commonly known as the Japanese wasabi or Japanese horseradish, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and mountainous regions. The plant features a thick, knotted root that is the primary edible part, known for its pungent aroma and spicy flavor. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy surface, while the flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes. This variety is closely related to the cultivated wasabi (Eutrema wasabi) but is often found in wild settings across East Asia."
