    "intro": "Eschweilera amplexifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red or orange fruits. It is valued for its dense, dark wood, which is highly sought after in musical instrument making. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
