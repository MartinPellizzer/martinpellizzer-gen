    "intro": "Erodium albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered bedstraw, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, delicate white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, bead-like fruits that contain the seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and dry, sunny areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it is considered a weed in some regions."
