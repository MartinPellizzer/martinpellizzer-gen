    "intro": "Eragrostis coromandeliana, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in regions with warm climates and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
