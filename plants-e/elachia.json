    "intro": "Elachia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving the plant its common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with four petals, and they are usually greenish-yellow in color. Elachia species are native to regions of Africa and the Middle East, where they often thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
