    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It originates from arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique texture and drought tolerance."
