    "intro": "Erica fastigiata var. immaculata, commonly known as the white heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It features dense, upright growth with small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive hedges or borders in garden settings."
