    "intro": "Eugenia sabulosa, commonly known as the sand eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Following flowering, it develops small, round, dark purple berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Eugenia sabulosa is valued for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
