    "intro": "Epilobium anagallidifolium var. diffusum, commonly known as the spreading willowherb, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a hairy surface and a pointed tip, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges."
