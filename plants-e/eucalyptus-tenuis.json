    "intro": "Eucalyptus tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southeastern Australia, particularly found in the states of New South Wales and Victoria. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrubs with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. It produces small white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Eucalyptus tenuis is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and woodland habitats."
