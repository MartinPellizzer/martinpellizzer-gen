    "intro": "Echinochloa glabrescens var. pilosa, commonly known as rough false brome, is a grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often bristly and inconspicuous. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
