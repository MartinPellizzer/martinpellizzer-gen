    "intro": "Echeandia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas echeandia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico, particularly in the state of Chiapas. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, and has a relatively small stature. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Echeandia chiapensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native ecosystem."
