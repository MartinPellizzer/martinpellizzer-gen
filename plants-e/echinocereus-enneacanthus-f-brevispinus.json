    "intro": "Echinocereus enneacanthus f. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical shape with a smooth, pale green stem that may develop a reddish tinge under full sun. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique morphology and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
