    "intro": "Eleocharis cellulosa, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to the plant's ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Eleocharis cellulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
