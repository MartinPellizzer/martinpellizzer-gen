    "intro": "Erigeron robustus, commonly known as the robust fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and prairies, preferring full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erigeron robustus is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
