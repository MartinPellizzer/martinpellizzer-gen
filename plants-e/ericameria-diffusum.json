    "intro": "Ericameria diffusum, commonly known as the broadleaf gumweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush habitats. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a notable component of arid ecosystems. Ericameria diffusum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
