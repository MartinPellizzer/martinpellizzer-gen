It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus coreanus is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a groundcover plant."
