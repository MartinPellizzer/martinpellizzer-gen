    "intro": "Eragrostis poiformis, commonly known as the smooth false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
