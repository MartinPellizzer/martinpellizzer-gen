    "intro": "Elaphoglossum montanum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a compact, creeping rhizome with small, lance-shaped fronds that are dark green and glossy. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
