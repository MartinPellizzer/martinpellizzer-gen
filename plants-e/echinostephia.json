    "intro": "Echinostephia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular leaves and showy, often yellow or red flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or wetland habitats. Echinostephia species are herbaceous or shrubby, with some species having a climbing habit. The fruits are usually capsules that release tiny seeds, aiding in the plant's dispersal."
