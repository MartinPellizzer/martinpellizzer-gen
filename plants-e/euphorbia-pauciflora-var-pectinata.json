    "intro": "Euphorbia pauciflora var. pectinata, commonly known as the wooly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, woolly white to grayish-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
