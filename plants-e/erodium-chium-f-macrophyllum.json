    "intro": "Erodium chium f. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved bedstraw, is a variant of the common bedstraw. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically larger than those of the typical form, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields."
