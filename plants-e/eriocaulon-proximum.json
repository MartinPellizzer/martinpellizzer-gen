    "intro": "Eriocaulon proximum, commonly known as the small spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in tight clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its compact growth habit and specialized habitat make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
