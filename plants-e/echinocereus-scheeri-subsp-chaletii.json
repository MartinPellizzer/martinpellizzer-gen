    "intro": "Echinocereus scheeri subsp. chaletii, commonly known as the Chaletii cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mound-forming cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact size and ornamental features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
