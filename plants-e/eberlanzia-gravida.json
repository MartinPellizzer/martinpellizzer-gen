    "intro": "Eberlanzia gravida, commonly known as the heavy-hearted balsa, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, lowland environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its lightweight wood, it has been historically used in the construction of model airplanes and other lightweight structures."
