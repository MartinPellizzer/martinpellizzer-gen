    "intro": "Eleocharis albida, commonly known as the white spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white flower spikes that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize shorelines. Eleocharis albida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
