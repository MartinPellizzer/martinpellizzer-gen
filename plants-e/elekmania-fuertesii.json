    "intro": "Elekmania fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes' elephant tree, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and sparse, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by distinctive berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elekmania fuertesii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
