    "intro": "Euphorbia nubigena var. nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-like euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of its arid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
