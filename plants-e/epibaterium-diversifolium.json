    "intro": "Epibaterium diversifolium, commonly known as the variable leaf epibaterium, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its diverse leaf morphology, which can vary significantly depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows on the trunks and branches of large trees, utilizing them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Epibaterium diversifolium plays a minor role in the ecosystem as a habitat for small invertebrates and contributes to the biodiversity of its forest habitat."
