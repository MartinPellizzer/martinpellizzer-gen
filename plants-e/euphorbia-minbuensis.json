    "intro": "Euphorbia minbuensis, commonly known as the Minbu spurge, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid landscapes."
