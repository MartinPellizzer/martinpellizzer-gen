It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Elaeagnus xichouensis is also known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
