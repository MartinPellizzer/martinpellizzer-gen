    "intro": "Eupatorium turbacense, commonly known as the swamp eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with hairy surfaces. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinct, aromatic scent when crushed. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are small and clustered in dense, spherical heads, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
