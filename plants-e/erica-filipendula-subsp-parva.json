    "intro": "Erica filipendula subsp. parva, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It typically reaches heights of no more than 10 centimeters, with compact, dense foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, ground-covering mats in suitable conditions."
