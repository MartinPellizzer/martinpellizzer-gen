    "intro": "Erianthus longifolius, commonly known as the tall bluestem grass, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly found in the Great Plains and eastern regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant is well adapted to prairie environments and can thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. Erianthus longifolius plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for wildlife. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, add visual interest and contribute to its ornamental value in native plant gardens."
