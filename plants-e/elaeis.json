It consists of several species, with Elaeis guineensis being the most economically important for its oil-rich fruits. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. Its fruits contain a high proportion of oil, which is extracted for use in food, cosmetics, and biofuels. The botanical features of Elaeis include large, fan-shaped leaves and a tall, slender trunk that supports its heavy fruiting clusters."
