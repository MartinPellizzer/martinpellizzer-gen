    "intro": "Echites alexicacus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Echites alexicacus is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate saline conditions."
