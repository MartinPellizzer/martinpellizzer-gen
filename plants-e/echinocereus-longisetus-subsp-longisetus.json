    "intro": "Echinocereus longisetus subsp. longisetus, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring cylindrical stems covered in clusters of sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
