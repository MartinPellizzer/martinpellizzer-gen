    "intro": "Echinopsis brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, thick stem and a dense covering of spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and unique growth pattern, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
