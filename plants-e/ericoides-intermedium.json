    "intro": "Ericoides intermedium, commonly known as the Intermediate Heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers, blueberries, and other ericaceous plants. The plant features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Ericoides intermedium thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
