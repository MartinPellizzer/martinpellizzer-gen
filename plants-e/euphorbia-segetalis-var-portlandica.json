    "intro": "Euphorbia segetalis var. portlandica, commonly known as the Portland spurge, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, ribbed stems and is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
