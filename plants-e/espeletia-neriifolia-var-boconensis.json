    "intro": "Espeletia neriifolia var. boconensis, commonly known as the Bocon\u00e9 espeletia, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, daisy-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes. Its flowers are typically purple or pink, and they bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
