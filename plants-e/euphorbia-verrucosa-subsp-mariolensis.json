    "intro": "Euphorbia verrucosa subsp. mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolensis Spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
