The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis gracilis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
