    "intro": "Eragrostis lasseri, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of native plant communities."
