    "intro": "Euphorbia alpina, commonly known as the alpine spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is surrounded by modified leaves known as bracts. Euphorbia alpina thrives in rocky or alpine soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
