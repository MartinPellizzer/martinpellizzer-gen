    "intro": "Echinops hispidus, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with gray-green, woolly leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Echinops hispidus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, rocky habitats. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
