    "intro": "Euphorbia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Euphorbia pinetorum is often found growing in pine forests and rocky areas, where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions."
