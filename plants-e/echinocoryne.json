It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit structures that are typically spherical or oval in shape. The plant typically has finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels. Echinocoryne species are often found in temperate regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to their unique morphology, they are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
