It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often floating or submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. This species is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich waters, making it an indicator of eutrophic conditions."
