    "intro": "Euphorbia altotibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with well-draining soil."
