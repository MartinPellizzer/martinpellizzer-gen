    "intro": "Epilobium latifolium var. tetrapetalum, commonly known as the broadleaf willowherb variant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks and wetlands. It is characterized by its tetraploid chromosome count, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Epilobium. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and wildlife in its habitat."
