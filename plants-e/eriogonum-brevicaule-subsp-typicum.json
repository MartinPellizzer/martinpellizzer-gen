    "intro": "Eriogonum brevicaule subsp. typicum, commonly known as the Pacific Coast buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. It has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
