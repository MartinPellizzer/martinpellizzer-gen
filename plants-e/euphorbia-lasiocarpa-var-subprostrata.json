    "intro": "Euphorbia lasiocarpa var. subprostrata, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is covered in soft, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
