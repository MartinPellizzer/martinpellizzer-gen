    "intro": "Euphorbia arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas spurge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. It typically grows in moist, woodland areas and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance."
