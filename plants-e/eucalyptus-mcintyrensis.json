    "intro": "Eucalyptus mcintyrensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the winter months. Its bark is often flaky and peels in strips, revealing a smooth, greyish underlayer. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
