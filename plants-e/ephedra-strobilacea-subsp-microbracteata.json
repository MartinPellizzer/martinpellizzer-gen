    "intro": "Ephedra strobilacea subsp. microbracteata, commonly known as the small-bract ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring woody stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the characteristic alkaloid compounds, such as ephedrine. It thrives in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its cultivation and use are now regulated."
