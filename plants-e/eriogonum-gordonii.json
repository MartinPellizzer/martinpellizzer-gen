    "intro": "Eriogonum gordonii, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, sticky resin, which helps to deter herbivores and retain moisture. Eriogonum gordonii is an important species for pollinators and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
