    "intro": "Eriogonum caespitosum var. acaule, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense, tufted clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant has no stem (hence the varietal name *acaule*), with leaves and flowers arising directly from the root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
