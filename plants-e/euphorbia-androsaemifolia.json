    "intro": "Euphorbia androsaemifolia, commonly known as the Androsaemifolia spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and striking foliage."
