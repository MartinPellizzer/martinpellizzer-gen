    "intro": "Euphorbia polygona var. polygona, commonly known as the many-armed spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered in a thick layer of white, waxy sap. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Euphorbia polygona var. polygona is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
