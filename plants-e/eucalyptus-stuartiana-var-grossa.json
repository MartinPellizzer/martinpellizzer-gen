    "intro": "Eucalyptus stuartiana var. grossa, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This variety is well-suited to coastal and sandy soils, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens and landscaping."
