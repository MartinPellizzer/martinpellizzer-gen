    "intro": "Euphorbia biaculeata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, green, spiny stems that form a compact, bushy structure. The plant produces yellowish-white cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia biaculeata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
