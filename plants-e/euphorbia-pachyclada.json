    "intro": "Euphorbia pachyclada, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, waxy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Euphorbia pachyclada is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
