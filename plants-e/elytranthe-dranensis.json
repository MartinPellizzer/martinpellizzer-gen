    "intro": "Elytranthe dranensis, commonly known as the Dranese elytranthe, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in partial shade. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Elytranthe dranensis is considered endangered and requires protection."
