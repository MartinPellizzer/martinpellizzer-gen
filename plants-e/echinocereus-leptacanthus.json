    "intro": "Echinocereus leptacanthus, commonly known as the narrow-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
