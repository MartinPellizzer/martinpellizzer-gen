    "intro": "Eucalyptus sideroxylon var. pallens, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, while the flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and clustered in umbels. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes planted in gardens for its unique foliage and drought tolerance."
