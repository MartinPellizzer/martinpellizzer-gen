    "intro": "Erycibe parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved erycibe, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
