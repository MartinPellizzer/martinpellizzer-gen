    "intro": "Erythrina edulis, commonly known as the edible coral tree, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant belongs to the family Fabaceae and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving fertility. Its seeds contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption without proper processing. The plant's ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a notable species in its native habitats."
