    "intro": "Elaphoglossum russelliae, commonly known as Russell's holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically green with a subtle metallic sheen. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
