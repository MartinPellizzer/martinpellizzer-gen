    "intro": "Enallagma obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate fairy shrimp, is a small crustacean belonging to the order Anostraca. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and a pair of long, feathery antennae. This species is typically found in temporary freshwater habitats such as ponds and vernal pools. Enallagma obovata plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as prey for various aquatic and terrestrial predators. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of water, making it an indicator species for temporary wetlands."
