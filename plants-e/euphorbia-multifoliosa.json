    "intro": "Euphorbia multifoliosa, commonly known as the many-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, green, lobed leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-draining soil. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
