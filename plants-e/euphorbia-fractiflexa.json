    "intro": "Euphorbia fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexible spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia fractiflexa is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
