It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a distinctive greenish tinge. Eulophia sandersonii thrives in humid, well-drained environments and requires bright, indirect light. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
