    "intro": "Exostegia, commonly known as the \"silverleaf plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Exostegia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. They produce small, tubular flowers in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
