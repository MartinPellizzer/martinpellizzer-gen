    "intro": "Eremochlamys arenaria, commonly known as the sand cholla, is a small, spineless cactus native to arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its desert environment. Its structure is compact, with a short, branching stem that helps reduce water loss. Eremochlamys arenaria plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
