It features dense, dark green leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in spring, which attract pollinators. Its red, berry-like fruits are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
