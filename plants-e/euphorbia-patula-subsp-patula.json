    "intro": "Euphorbia patula subsp. patula, commonly known as the Mexican devil\u2019s backbone, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
