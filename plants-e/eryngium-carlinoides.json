    "intro": "Eryngium carlinoides, commonly known as the blueweed or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its spiky, blue-violet flower heads that resemble small umbrellas, surrounded by bracts. The plant has silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Eryngium carlinoides is a hardy perennial that plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects."
