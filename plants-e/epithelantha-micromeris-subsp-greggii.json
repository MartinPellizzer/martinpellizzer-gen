    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris subsp. greggii, commonly known as the Gregg's ghost flower, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly bristles. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to the typical E. micromeris."
