    "intro": "Eucalyptus willisii, commonly known as the Will's malleable gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from grey to white in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a distinctive aromatic scent. Eucalyptus willisii is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
