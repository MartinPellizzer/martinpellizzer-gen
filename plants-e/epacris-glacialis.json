    "intro": "Epacris glacialis, commonly known as the alpine epacris, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing shrubs. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. Epacris glacialis is often found in alpine heathlands and is a common sight in the Australian Alps."
