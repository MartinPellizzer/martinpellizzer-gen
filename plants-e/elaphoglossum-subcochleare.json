    "intro": "Elaphoglossum subcochleare, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping rhizomes that produce new fronds from the base. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided, needle-like segments that give it a delicate appearance. This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
