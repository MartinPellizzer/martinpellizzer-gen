    "intro": "Elaphoglossum peltatum f. foeniculaceum, commonly known as the foeniculaceum fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed holly fern. It is a small, delicate fern with finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting."
