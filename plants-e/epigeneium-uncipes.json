    "intro": "Epigeneium uncipes, commonly known as the climbing epigeneium, is a tropical vine belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its climbing habit and is often found in humid, shaded environments in Southeast Asia. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spadices. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread along the forest floor or climb trees. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
