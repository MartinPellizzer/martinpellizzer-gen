It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
