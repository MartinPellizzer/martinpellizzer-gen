    "intro": "Effusiella hians, commonly known as the silver hair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, soft fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which contributes to its common name. Effusiella hians is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
