    "intro": "Exocarya, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their low, mat-forming growth habit and are often found in sandy or rocky soils. The flowers are typically small, bell-shaped, and come in shades of white, blue, or purple. Exocarya species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
