    "intro": "Euphorbia kingdon-wardii, commonly known as the Kingdon-Ward's spurge, is a succulent plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
