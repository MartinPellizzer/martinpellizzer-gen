    "intro": "Eucomis comosa, commonly known as the \"whispertree\" or \"pineapple lily,\" is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, spherical base. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences topped with clusters of white or pink, pineapple-shaped flower heads. These flowers are surrounded by long, narrow bracts that give the plant its distinctive appearance. Eucomis comosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
