    "intro": "Elaeocarpus murudensis, commonly known as the Murudensian elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, hard, woody fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the genus Elaeocarpus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
