    "intro": "Epigynium, commonly known as the inferior ovary, is a botanical structure found in certain flowering plants. It refers to the portion of the flower where the ovary is located below the attachment point of the pistil. This structure is typically found in plants of the Solanaceae family, such as tomatoes and potatoes. The epigynium is often fused with other floral parts, forming a unique structure known as the calyx. It plays a crucial role in the reproductive process by supporting the ovules that develop into seeds."
