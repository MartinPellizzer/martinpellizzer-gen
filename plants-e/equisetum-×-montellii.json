    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 montellii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a species that results from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late summer. Equisetum \u00d7 montellii thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its recognition in botanical studies."
