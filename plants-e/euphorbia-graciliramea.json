    "intro": "Euphorbia graciliramea, commonly known as the slender-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with a distinctive, spiny appearance, and its leaves are typically small and fleshy. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
