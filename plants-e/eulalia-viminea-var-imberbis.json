    "intro": "Eulalia viminea var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and feathery, panicle-like inflorescences that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. The variety imberbis distinguishes itself by lacking the fine hairy structures found on the typical variety of Eulalia viminea."
