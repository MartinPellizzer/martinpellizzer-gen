    "intro": "Euphorbia albrechtii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features distinctive, thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia albrechtii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
