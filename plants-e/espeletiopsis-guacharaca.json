    "intro": "Espeletiopsis guacharaca, commonly known as the Guacharaca orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. The plant has a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in a spike. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
