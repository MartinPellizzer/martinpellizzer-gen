    "intro": "Elkania, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly China. These plants are evergreen shrubs characterized by their dense, leathery foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Elkania species typically thrive in well-drained, acidic soils and are often found in forest understories. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
