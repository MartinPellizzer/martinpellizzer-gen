    "intro": "Eucalyptus camphora, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Eucalyptus camphora is often found in dry, sandy soils and can grow as either a shrub or a small tree. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
