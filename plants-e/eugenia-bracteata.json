    "intro": "Eugenia bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features simple, elliptic leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various soil types and climates, though it prefers well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a fruit-bearing plant in subtropical gardens."
