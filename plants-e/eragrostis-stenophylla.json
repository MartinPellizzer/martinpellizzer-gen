    "intro": "Eragrostis stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to the United States, particularly in the central and eastern regions. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to reddish, appearing in late spring to early summer. Eragrostis stenophylla is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
