    "intro": "Ephedra vulgaris var. arborea, commonly known as the tree ephedra, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and scale-like leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on different plants. Its stems contain ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine. This species is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
