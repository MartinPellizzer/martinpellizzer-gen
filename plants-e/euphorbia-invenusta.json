    "intro": "Euphorbia invenusta, commonly known as the velvetleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often lobed and have a velvety texture, contributing to its common name. Euphorbia invenusta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
