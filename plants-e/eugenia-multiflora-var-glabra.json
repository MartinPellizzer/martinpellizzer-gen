    "intro": "Eugenia multiflora var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-eared eugenia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and elliptical, dark green leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for conservation purposes."
