    "intro": "Eulophia cucullata var. dilecta, commonly known as the hooded eulophia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flower spike that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale green with a distinctive, elongated lip. The orchid produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
