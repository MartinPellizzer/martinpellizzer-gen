    "intro": "Eriochloa crebra, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Eriochloa crebra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological studies."
