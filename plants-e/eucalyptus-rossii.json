    "intro": "Eucalyptus rossii, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The tree produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is a medium to large tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, often found in coastal and dry forest regions. Eucalyptus rossii is valued for its timber and has also been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
