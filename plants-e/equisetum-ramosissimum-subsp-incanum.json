    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum subsp. incanum, commonly known as the silver fir or slender horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and its distinctive, hollow, jointed stems. The plant produces spores rather than flowers, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species."
