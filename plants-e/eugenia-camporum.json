    "intro": "Eugenia camporum, commonly known as the red-flowered eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that eventually give way to bright red, edible berries. These berries are often consumed by birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Eugenia camporum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
