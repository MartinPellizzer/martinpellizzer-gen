    "intro": "Echium canum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and large, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echium canum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
