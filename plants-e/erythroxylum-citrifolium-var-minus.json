    "intro": "Erythroxylum citrifolium var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf citrifolium. It is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae, characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is native to parts of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. It produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its genus."
