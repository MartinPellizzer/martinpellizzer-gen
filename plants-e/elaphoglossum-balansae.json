    "intro": "Elaphoglossum balansae, commonly known as the Balansae holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has lance-shaped, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Elaphoglossum balansae is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
