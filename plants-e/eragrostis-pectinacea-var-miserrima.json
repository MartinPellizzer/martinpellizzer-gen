It is characterized by its drooping, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
