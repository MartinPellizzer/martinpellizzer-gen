    "intro": "Epidendrum pseudopolystachyum, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical or subtropical climates. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
