    "intro": "Eranthis lobulata var. lobulata, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has smooth, hairy stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens. Its early blooming habit makes it a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators."
