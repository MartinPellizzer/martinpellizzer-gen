    "intro": "Eulophia monticola, commonly known as the mountain eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces inflorescences bearing small, pale green to white flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
