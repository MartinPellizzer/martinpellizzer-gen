    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. robustum, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are typically found near the ground level. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its robust growth and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
