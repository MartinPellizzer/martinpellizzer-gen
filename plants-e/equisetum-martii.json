    "intro": "Equisetum martii, commonly known as the basket fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Equisetales. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a distinct, unbranched stem that remains green throughout the year. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Equisetum martii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
