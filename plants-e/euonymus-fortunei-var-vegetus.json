    "intro": "Euonymus fortunei var. vegetus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its dense growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in certain regions and may require careful management."
