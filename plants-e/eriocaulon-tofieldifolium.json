    "intro": "Eriocaulon tofieldifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, erect stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. Eriocaulon tofieldifolium plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
