    "intro": "Erigeron conyzoides, commonly known as the blueweed or blue mistflower, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its blue to purple flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Erigeron conyzoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
