    "intro": "Eriogonum racemosum var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces fibrous, thread-like seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates."
