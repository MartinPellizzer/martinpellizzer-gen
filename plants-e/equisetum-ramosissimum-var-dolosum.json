It is a perennial plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, spore-bearing cones and its distinctive, hollow, segmented stems. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands or along streams. Its stems are typically green and lack leaves, with the spore-producing structures forming at the nodes. The plant is notable for its ancient lineage, belonging to one of the oldest groups of vascular plants."
