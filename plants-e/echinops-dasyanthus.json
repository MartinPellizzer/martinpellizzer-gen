It is characterized by its spiny, spherical stems and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
