    "intro": "Ecbolium caracasanum, commonly known as the Caracasanum sunspire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence composed of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sunlight to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
