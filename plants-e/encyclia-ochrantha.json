    "intro": "Encyclia ochrantha, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow petals and a greenish-yellow lip, which are striking features in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid and shaded conditions. Encyclia ochrantha has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in fluctuating environmental conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
