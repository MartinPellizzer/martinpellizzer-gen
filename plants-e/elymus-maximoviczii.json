    "intro": "Elymus maximoviczii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
