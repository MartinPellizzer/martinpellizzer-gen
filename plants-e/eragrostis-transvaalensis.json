    "intro": "Eragrostis transvaalensis, commonly known as Transvaal needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Eragrostis transvaalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
