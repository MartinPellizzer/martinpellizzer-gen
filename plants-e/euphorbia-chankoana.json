    "intro": "Euphorbia chankoana, commonly known as the Chanko euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its unique, spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its native habitat."
