    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 alpicola, commonly known as the alpine willow or alpine flowering willow, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine habitats, often forming dense mats or cushions to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Epilobium \u00d7 alpicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
