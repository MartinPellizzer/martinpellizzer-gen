    "intro": "Effusiella brenneri, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a delicate aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant has small, palmately divided leaves that are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and marshes. Effusiella brenneri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
