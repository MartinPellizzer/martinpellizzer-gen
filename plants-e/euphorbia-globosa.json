    "intro": "Euphorbia globosa, commonly known as the globular spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia globosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
