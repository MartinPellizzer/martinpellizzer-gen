    "intro": "Euphorbia globulifera, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spherical, spiky stems that resemble a globe, which are covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia globulifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
