    "intro": "Eriogonum jamesii var. jamesii, commonly known as the desert primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. The species is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
