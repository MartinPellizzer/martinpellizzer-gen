It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and as a forage plant for livestock."
