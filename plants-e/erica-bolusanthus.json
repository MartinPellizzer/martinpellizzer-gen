    "intro": "Erica bolusanthus, commonly known as the Bolus heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica bolusanthus is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and requires minimal water once established. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
