    "intro": "Erigeron austiniae, commonly known as Austin's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern regions of Texas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and it thrives in full sun. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Erigeron austiniae is often used in native plant gardens due to its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
