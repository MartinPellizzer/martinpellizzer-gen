It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly waxy texture. Euplassa nitida is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
