    "intro": "Erica passerina, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica passerina is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
