    "intro": "Eurya chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese eurya, is a species of evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Eurya chinensis is often found in forested areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
