    "intro": "Elaphoglossum micropogon, commonly known as the small-headed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Elaphoglossum micropogon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
