    "intro": "Echinopsis escayachensis, commonly known as the Escayache cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spiny areoles. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Echinopsis escayachensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
