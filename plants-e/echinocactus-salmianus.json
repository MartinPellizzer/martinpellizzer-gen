    "intro": "Echinocactus salmianus, commonly known as the Salmiana cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Echinocactus salmianus is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
