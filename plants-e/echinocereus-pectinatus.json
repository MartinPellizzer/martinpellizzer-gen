    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus, commonly known as the pectinatus cactus or the yellow night-blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Echinocereus pectinatus is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water needs and ornamental value."
