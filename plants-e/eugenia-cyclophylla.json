    "intro": "Eugenia cyclophylla, commonly known as the Australian lilac, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale purple or white, which bloom in spring. These flowers give way to edible, red, fleshy berries that are popular in native cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
