It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in specific regions of the Balkans and Turkey. Its foliage consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
