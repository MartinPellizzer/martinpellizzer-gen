    "intro": "Epidendrum macrogastrium, commonly known as the Giant Lip Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a prominent, fleshy lip that can reach up to 5 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually yellow or orange with a contrasting purple or red lip, making it a striking ornamental plant."
