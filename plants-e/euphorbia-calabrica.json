    "intro": "Euphorbia calabrica, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are often green or red in color, with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia calabrica is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
