    "intro": "Euphorbia polygonata, commonly known as the zigzag euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that form a bushy, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Euphorbia polygonata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
