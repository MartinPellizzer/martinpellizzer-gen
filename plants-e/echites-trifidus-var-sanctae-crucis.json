It features a branching stem structure with three to five ribs, giving it its scientific name \"trifidus.\" The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or containers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
