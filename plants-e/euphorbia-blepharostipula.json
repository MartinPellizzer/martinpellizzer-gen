    "intro": "Euphorbia blepharostipula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
