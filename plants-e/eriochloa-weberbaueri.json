    "intro": "Eriochloa weberbaueri, commonly known as the silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Eriochloa weberbaueri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
