    "intro": "Elcaja emetica, commonly known as the emetic lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The name \"emetica\" refers to its historical use in inducing vomiting, though it is now primarily appreciated for its ornamental value."
