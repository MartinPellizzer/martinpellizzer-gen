These plants are characterized by their distinctive, shield-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. Ervilia species are typically found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. They often serve as early successional plants in disturbed habitats. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage and flowers."
