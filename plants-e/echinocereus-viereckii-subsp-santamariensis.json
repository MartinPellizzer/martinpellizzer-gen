    "intro": "Echinocereus viereckii subsp. santamariensis, commonly known as the Santa Maria hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 15 centimeters. The plant produces white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
