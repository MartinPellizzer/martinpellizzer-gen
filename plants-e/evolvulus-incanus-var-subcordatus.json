It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems and heart-shaped, silver-velvet leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open fields.
