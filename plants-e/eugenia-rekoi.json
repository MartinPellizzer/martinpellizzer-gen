    "intro": "Eugenia rekoi, commonly known as the Cameroon apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, apple-like berries. These berries are typically consumed fresh or used in local cuisines, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Eugenia rekoi is also known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
