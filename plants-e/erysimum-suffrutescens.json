    "intro": "Erysimum suffrutescens, commonly known as the rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to full sun. Erysimum suffrutescens is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
