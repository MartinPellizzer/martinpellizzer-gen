    "intro": "Espostoa mirabilis, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its fruit, a bright red berry, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Despite its toxicity, Espostoa mirabilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native ecosystem."
