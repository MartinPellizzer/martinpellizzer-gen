    "intro": "Ecbolium flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Ecbolium flaccidum is a carnivorous plant, relying on its specialized traps to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
