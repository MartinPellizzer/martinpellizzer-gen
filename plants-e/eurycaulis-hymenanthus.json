    "intro": "Eurycaulis hymenanthus, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils, while its fibrous roots help retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Eurycaulis hymenanthus is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
