It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a unique, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact size and striking foliage make it a desirable ornamental plant."
