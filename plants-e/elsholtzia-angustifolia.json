    "intro": "Elsholtzia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf elsholtzia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, aromatic stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in spikes at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Elsholtzia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
