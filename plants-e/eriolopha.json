    "intro": "Eriolopha, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often with five petals, and are usually pale in color. Eriolopha species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
