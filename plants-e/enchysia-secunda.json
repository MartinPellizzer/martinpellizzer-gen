    "intro": "Enchysia secunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal environments. Enchysia secunda plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
