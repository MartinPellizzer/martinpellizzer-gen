    "intro": "Eurya hupehensis, commonly known as the Chinese holly or winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its seasonal color changes. Eurya hupehensis is also valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various garden conditions."
