The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, blooming from late spring to early summer. Emilia rigida is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
