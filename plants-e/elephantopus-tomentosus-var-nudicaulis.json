It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and typically have a hairy surface. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf structure compared to the typical form of Elephantopus tomentosus."
