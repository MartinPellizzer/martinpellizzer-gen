    "intro": "Epidendrum \u00d7 inauditum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum \u00d7 inauditum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements."
