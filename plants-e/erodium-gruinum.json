    "intro": "Erodium gruinum, commonly known as the common stinkcup, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features small, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, cup-like structure called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Erodium gruinum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
