    "intro": "Eragrostis lateritica, commonly known as the red grass or red oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that often turn reddish in color, especially under drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread aggressively and form dense mats, making it a common component of dryland vegetation. Eragrostis lateritica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
