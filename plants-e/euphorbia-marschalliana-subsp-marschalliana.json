    "intro": "Euphorbia marschalliana subsp. marschalliana, commonly known as the Marschall's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with a crown of fleshy, green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and striking foliage."
