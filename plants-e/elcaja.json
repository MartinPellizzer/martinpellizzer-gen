    "intro": "Elcaja, commonly known as the nightshade or belladonna, is a toxic plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces glossy, black berries that are highly poisonous but have been historically used in traditional medicine. Elcaja thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its presence in the ecosystem is both ecologically significant and potentially dangerous due to its toxic properties."
