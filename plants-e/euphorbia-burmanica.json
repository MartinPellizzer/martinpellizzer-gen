    "intro": "Euphorbia burmanica, commonly known as the Burmese spurge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically alternate and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia burmanica is often found in rocky or sandy soils in tropical and subtropical regions."
