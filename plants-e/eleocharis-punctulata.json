    "intro": "Eleocharis punctulata, commonly known as the dot bulb rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats. Eleocharis punctulata is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
