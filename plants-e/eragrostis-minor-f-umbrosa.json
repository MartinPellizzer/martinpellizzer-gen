    "intro": "Eragrostis minor f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow grass, is a compact, low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is occasionally used in ecological landscaping."
