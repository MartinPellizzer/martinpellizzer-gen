    "intro": "Erythranthe karakormiana, commonly known as the Karakorum sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are usually basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erythranthe karakormiana is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
