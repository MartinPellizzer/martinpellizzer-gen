    "intro": "Euphorbia radlkoferi, commonly known as the red globe euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical shape and bright red bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green, though they may be tinged with red or purple. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
