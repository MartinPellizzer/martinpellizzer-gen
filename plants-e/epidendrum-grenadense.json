    "intro": "Epidendrum grenadense, commonly known as the Grenada Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly Grenada and nearby islands. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to attach to trees or other surfaces in its natural habitat. Epidendrum grenadense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
