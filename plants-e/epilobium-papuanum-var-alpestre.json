    "intro": "Epilobium papuanum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine willow or mountain willow, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments, it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native range."
