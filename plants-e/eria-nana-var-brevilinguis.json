    "intro": "Eria nana var. brevilinguis, commonly known as the dwarf eria orchid, is a compact, low-growing orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It features small, clustered pseudobulbs and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. This variety is particularly suited for container gardening and indoor spaces due to its compact size and adaptability."
