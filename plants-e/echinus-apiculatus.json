    "intro": "Echinus apiculatus, commonly known as the spiny sea urchin, is a species of sea urchin belonging to the family Echinoidea. It is characterized by its spherical body covered in short, spiny projections that provide protection against predators. The test, or skeletal framework, is composed of calcium carbonate plates arranged in a complex, symmetrical pattern. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on algae and detritus. Its reproductive system involves the release of eggs and sperm into the water, contributing to its role in marine ecosystems."
