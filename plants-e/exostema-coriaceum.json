    "intro": "Exostema coriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved sterculia, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its roots are known to have medicinal properties and are used in traditional herbal remedies. The plant's resilience to shade and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common species in tropical forests."
