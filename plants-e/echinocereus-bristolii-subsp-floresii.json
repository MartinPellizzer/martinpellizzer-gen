    "intro": "Echinocereus bristolii subsp. floresii, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, typically at night. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its adaptations to arid environments, it is a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
