    "intro": "Enriquebeltrania, commonly known as the \"Mexican moonflower,\" is a rare and striking plant native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), known for its large, white, fragrant blooms that open at night. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring showy, trumpet-shaped flowers and thick, waxy leaves adapted to arid conditions. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a pollinator attractant, particularly for nocturnal insects like moths. Due to habitat loss, Enriquebeltrania is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
