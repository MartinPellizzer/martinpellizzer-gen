    "intro": "Elymus bungeanus subsp. pruinifer, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
