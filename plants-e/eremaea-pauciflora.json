    "intro": "Eremaea pauciflora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from June to August. The plant has a compact, sprawling habit with grey-green foliage that helps it withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs, which reduce water loss. Eremaea pauciflora is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands."
