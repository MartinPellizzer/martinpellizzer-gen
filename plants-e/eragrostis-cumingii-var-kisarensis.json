    "intro": "Eragrostis cumingii var. kisarensis, commonly known as the Kisar grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Kisar in Indonesia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute grains, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open, sunny habitats such as coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
