    "intro": "Eucalyptus viminalis var. rhynchocorys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a variant of the narrow-leaf mallee eucalypt. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub or small tree form, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous in appearance. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and are followed by woody capsules that contain aromatic, elliptical seeds. This variant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is an important component of the flora in southern Australia, particularly in the regions of South Australia and Western Australia."
