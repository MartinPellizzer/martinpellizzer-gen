    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hurlimannii, commonly known as the Hurlimann's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a fleshy, reddish-brown indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Elaphoglossum hurlimannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
