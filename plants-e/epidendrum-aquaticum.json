    "intro": "Epidendrum aquaticum, commonly known as the water orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, slender stems and produces clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers that are often borne on aerial roots. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Epidendrum aquaticum thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
