    "intro": "Echinocactus horripilus var. erectocentrus, commonly known as the Mexican horsehair cactus, is a striking cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in dense, white, horsehair-like spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
