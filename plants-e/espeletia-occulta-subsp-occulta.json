    "intro": "Espeletia occulta subsp. occulta, commonly known as the hidden espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or arid soils, and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
