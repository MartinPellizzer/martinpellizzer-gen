    "intro": "Engysiphon roseoalbus, commonly known as the white-flowered engysiphon, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, fragrant blossoms. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
