It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Elynanthus tenerrimus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
