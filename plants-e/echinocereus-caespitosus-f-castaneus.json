    "intro": "Echinocereus caespitosus f. castaneus, commonly known as the red-pearled hedgehog cactus, is a compact, columnar cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a spiny, cylindrical stem with a distinctive reddish or rust-colored bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its fleshy, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to rocky, well-drained soils."
