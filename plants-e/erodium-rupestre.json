    "intro": "Erodium rupestre, commonly known as the rock eryngo, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with five petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Erodium rupestre thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas."
