    "intro": "Euphorbia trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous branched stems that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its sap is milky and can be irritating to the skin, a common characteristic among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
