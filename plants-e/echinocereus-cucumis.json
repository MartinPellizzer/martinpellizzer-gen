    "intro": "Echinocereus cucumis, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spineless, flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruits, called tunas, are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor. The plant is also valued for its ability to provide shade and habitat for desert wildlife."
