It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by yellowish-orange fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Euodia gracilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its compact size and attractive foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
