    "intro": "Erdisia squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly erdisia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its densely hairy, often whitish or grayish foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round, woody fruits. Erdisia squarrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and drought tolerance."
