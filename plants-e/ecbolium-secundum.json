    "intro": "Ecbolium secundum, commonly known as the lesser wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Ecbolium secundum is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
