    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. sabulosus, commonly known as the sandy wild rye, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, bluish-green leaves and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds."
