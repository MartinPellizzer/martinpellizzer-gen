    "intro": "Euphorbia juvoklanti, commonly known as the red-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically red or purple in color, which help it store water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia juvoklanti is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
