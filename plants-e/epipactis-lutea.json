    "intro": "Epipactis lutea, commonly known as the yellow helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and large, showy yellow-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Epipactis lutea is known for its ability to form dense colonies, making it a notable component of forest understory vegetation."
