    "intro": "Elyna scirpina, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a triangular cross-section, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces tiny, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by water. Elyna scirpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
