    "intro": "Eucalyptus baueriana subsp. thalassina, commonly known as the coastal eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that often reveals a yellowish or reddish inner layer. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a grey-green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, globular inflorescences that bear white or pale yellow flowers, which are attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
