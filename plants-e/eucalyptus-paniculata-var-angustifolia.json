    "intro": "Eucalyptus paniculata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, narrow leaves that are often tinged with blue or grey. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in drooping clusters, which are followed by woody, cylindrical capsules. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands, and is adapted to withstand drought and fire. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
