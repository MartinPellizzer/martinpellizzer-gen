    "intro": "Eutrema wasabi var. tenue, commonly known as Japanese wasabi, is a perennial plant native to the mountain streams of Japan. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically in shaded areas. The plant has a short, stout stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating. Its most distinctive feature is the underground rhizome, which is the part used for its pungent, spicy flavor. This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar growth habits and chemical properties."
