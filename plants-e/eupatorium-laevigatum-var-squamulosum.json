It is characterized by its blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer, forming dense, mist-like clusters. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
