    "intro": "Erysimum cheiranthoides var. nodosum, commonly known as the nodding wallflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and often reddish in color. This variety is distinguished by its nodding inflorescences, where the flowers droop slightly, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
