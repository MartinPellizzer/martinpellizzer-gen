    "intro": "Epipactis komoricensis, commonly known as the Komoren orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Comoros archipelago. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces a single, tall inflorescence bearing numerous small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
