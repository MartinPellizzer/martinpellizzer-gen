    "intro": "Equisetum telmateia var. comosum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the top of the stems. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp environments. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
