    "intro": "Euroschinus sylvicola, commonly known as the black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, ridged bark and compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk, which are highly valued for their flavor and nutritional content. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the nuts, contributing to its spread across forested areas. The plant has significant ecological and economic importance, particularly in forestry and wildlife habitats."
