    "intro": "Ethulia greenwayi, commonly known as the Greenway's orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive system relies on specific pollinators, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Ethulia greenwayi is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
