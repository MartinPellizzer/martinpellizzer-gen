    "intro": "Epidendrum pirrense, commonly known as the Pink Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and somewhat leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its often arid environment. Epidendrum pirrense is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements."
