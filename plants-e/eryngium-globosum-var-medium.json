    "intro": "Eryngium globosum var. medium, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, blue to purple flower heads that are surrounded by spiny, bristly leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its foliage is gray-green with a rough texture, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its distinctive appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
