    "intro": "Euphorbia atlantis var. major, commonly known as the Atlantis euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted for arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and green, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its slow growth and ability to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
