    "intro": "Epidendrum allenii, commonly known as the Allen's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces pendulous racemes of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate to high humidity for optimal growth. Epidendrum allenii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
