    "intro": "Echiochilon johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's ghostflower, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing habit. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
