    "intro": "Echium delileanum, commonly known as the Delile's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to dry, coastal environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. Echium delileanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
