    "intro": "Epidendrum crassilabium, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum crassilabium is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
