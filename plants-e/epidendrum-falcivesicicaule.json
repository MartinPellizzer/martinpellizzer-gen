    "intro": "Epidendrum falcivesicicaule, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum falcivesicicaule is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
