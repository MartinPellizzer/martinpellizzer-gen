    "intro": "Erica massonii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
