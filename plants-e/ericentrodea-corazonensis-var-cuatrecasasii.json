    "intro": "Ericentrodea corazonensis var. cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' ericentrode, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, shaded forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
