    "intro": "Eugenia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
