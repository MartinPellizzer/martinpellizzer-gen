    "intro": "Escallonia sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered escallonia, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has a compact, rounded shape. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the bright pink or red flowers. Escallonia sparsiflora is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils."
