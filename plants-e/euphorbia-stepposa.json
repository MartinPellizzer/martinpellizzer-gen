    "intro": "Euphorbia stepposa, commonly known as the steppe spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with smooth, grayish-green stems that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a slight pubescence. Euphorbia stepposa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a slow growth rate."
