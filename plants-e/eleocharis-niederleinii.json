    "intro": "Eleocharis niederleinii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, grass-like plant that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks the prominent sheaths found in many other Cyperaceae species. Eleocharis niederleinii is often found in shallow water or moist soil, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland habitats."
