    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis subsp. volgensis, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
