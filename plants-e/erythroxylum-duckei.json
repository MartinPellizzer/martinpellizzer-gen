    "intro": "Erythroxylum duckei, commonly known as the Duckei coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is notable for containing alkaloids, though it is not as well-known for its psychoactive properties as other coca species. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments at moderate altitudes."
