    "intro": "Echinolobium trichocarpum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
