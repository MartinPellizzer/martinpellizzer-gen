    "intro": "Euphorbia schultzii, commonly known as Schultze's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
