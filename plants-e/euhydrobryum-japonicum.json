    "intro": "Euhydrobryum japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese spikemoss, is a member of the family Hypnaceae and is native to East Asia. It is a small, evergreen moss-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, cushion-like growth form with elongated, needle-like leaves that are usually dark green in color. It produces spore capsules that are borne on stalks, which are often reddish in color and clustered at the tips of the stems. Euhydrobryum japonicum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small invertebrates."
