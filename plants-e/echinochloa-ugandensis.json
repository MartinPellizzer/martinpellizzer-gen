    "intro": "Echinochloa ugandensis, commonly known as Uganda needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
