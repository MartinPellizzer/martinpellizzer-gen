    "intro": "Eriogonum heracleoides subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces seed capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its ecological importance for pollinators."
