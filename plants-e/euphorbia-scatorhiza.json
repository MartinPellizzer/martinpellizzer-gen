    "intro": "Euphorbia scatorhiza, commonly known as the spreading euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia scatorhiza is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
