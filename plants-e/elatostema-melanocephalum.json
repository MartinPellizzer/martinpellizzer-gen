It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its delicate, opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Elatostema melanocephalum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
