    "intro": "Erica muscari, commonly known as the musk carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that produces dense clusters of small, pink or purple flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Erica muscari is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
