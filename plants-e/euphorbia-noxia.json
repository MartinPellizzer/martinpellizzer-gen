    "intro": "Euphorbia noxia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and unique inflorescences called cyathia. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub or perennial herb, often forming dense colonies in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are usually small, opposite, and sometimes lobed, while its flowers are clustered in cup-like structures. Euphorbia noxia is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce water loss."
