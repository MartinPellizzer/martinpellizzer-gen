It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing fine, white seeds. It is notable for its alkaloid content, particularly cocaine, which has significant pharmacological and historical importance. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also classified as a controlled substance in many countries."
