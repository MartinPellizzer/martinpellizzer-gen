    "intro": "Eria cootesii, commonly known as the Cootes' orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and it produces showy, often brightly colored blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Eria cootesii is considered a valuable species in botanical conservation efforts."
