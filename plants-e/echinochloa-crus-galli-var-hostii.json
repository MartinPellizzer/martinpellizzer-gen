    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli var. hostii, commonly known as cocklebur, is a perennial weed native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny fruits and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along waterways. It produces small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. This variant is often considered invasive in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
