    "intro": "Eriogonum deflexum var. deflexum, commonly known as the bentleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly curved, giving it the \"bentleaf\" designation. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
