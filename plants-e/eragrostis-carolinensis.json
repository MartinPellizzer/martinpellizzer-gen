    "intro": "Eragrostis carolinensis, commonly known as common cottongrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, ditches, and wetlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eragrostis carolinensis is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
