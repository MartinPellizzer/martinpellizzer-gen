    "intro": "Eriachne insularis, commonly known as the island grass, is a perennial grass species native to various islands in the Indo-Pacific region. It typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize sandy soils. Eriachne insularis is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
