    "intro": "Eugenia rampans, commonly known as the climbing guava, is a tropical shrub or vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, pink to red berries. Eugenia rampans is often found in moist, shaded areas and can be used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical regions."
