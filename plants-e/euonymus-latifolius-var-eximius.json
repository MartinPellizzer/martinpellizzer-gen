    "intro": "Euonymus latifolius var. eximius, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy sheen that becomes more pronounced in the shade. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to reveal bright red seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions, making it a concern for ecological balance."
