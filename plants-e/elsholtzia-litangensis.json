It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for cold and low-nutrient soils. Its small, tubular flowers are usually blue to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
