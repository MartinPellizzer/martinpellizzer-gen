It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
