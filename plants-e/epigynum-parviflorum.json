    "intro": "Epigynum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower epigynum, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant's flowers are epigynous, meaning the floral parts are attached above the ovary, a feature common in many members of its family. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
