    "intro": "Eugenia salomonensis, commonly known as the Solomon Islands guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pinkish-red berries. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
