    "intro": "Erythraea pulchella var. caespitosa, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is a perennial herb that forms dense, clump-like growths, with slender, hairy stems that often grow in tight clusters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
