It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and are capable of storing water. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Echinocactus tuberculatus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
