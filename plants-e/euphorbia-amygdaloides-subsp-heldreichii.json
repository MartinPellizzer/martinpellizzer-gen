    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides subsp. heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features a distinctive, low-growing form with pale green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular plant in horticulture, though it should be handled with care as it contains toxic sap."
