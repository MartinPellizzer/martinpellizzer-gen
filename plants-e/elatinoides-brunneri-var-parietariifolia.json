    "intro": "Elatinoides brunneri var. parietariifolia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of stabilizing sandy landscapes."
