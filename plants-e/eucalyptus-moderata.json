    "intro": "Eucalyptus moderata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree form, with smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically measuring up to 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in late summer to autumn. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
