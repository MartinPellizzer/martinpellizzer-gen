    "intro": "Ehretia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny ehretia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, moist forests, or disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
