    "intro": "Euphorbia exigua var. merinoi, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
