    "intro": "Elaphoglossum volkensii, commonly known as the Volkens' holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
