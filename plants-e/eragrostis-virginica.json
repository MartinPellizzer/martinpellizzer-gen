    "intro": "Eragrostis virginica, commonly known as Virginia wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in wetland ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Virginia wiregrass is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience in wet conditions."
