    "intro": "Elymus dentatus subsp. scaber, commonly known as rough leaf wild rye, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stiff, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are cylindrical, with spikelets arranged in pairs, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
