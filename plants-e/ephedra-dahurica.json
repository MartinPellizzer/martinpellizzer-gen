    "intro": "Ephedra dahurica, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern China. It is characterized by its green, branched stems that resemble wood and its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and reddish-brown seed pods, which contain minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Ephedra dahurica is adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its stems and exhibiting a slow growth rate. It has been historically used in traditional Chinese medicine for its stimulant properties, though its use is now regulated due to the presence of ephedrine."
