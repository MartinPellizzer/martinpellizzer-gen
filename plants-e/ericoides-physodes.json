    "intro": "Ericoides physodes, commonly known as the redstem ericoid, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, leathery berries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or open woodland habitats. Ericoides physodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
