    "intro": "Epidendrum leucomelanum, commonly known as the white and black Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, contrasting white and dark green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers with yellow lips, which bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum leucomelanum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
