    "intro": "Ellipanthus sterculiifolius, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture deep in the soil. Ellipanthus sterculiifolius plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
