    "intro": "Elaeocarpus pachyophrys, commonly known as the thick-shelled elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, woody fruits that encase a single, hard-shelled seed. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture. The species is valued for its durable wood and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique fruit morphology."
