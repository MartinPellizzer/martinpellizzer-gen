    "intro": "Elytraria prolifera, commonly known as the coastal grass or sea grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds."
