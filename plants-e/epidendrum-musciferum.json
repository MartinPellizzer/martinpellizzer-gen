    "intro": "Epidendrum musciferum, commonly known as the mossy orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, hanging stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in humid environments and often grows on trees or rocks. Its unique feature is the presence of moss-like growths on its stems, which contribute to its common name. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
