It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments on rocky slopes and cliffs. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it faces significant threats to its survival."
