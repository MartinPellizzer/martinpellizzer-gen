    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 aequans, commonly known as the Sydney peppermint, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus palustris and Eucalyptus robusta. It is a tall, fast-growing tree with smooth, peeling bark that reveals a silver-green underlayer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. It produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
