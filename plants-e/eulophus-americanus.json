    "intro": "Eulophus americanus, commonly known as the American gall wasp, is a small parasitic wasp species that plays a significant role in plant biology. It is known for inducing the formation of galls on the stems of certain plants, primarily those in the genus *Rhus*. These galls are abnormal growths caused by the wasp's larvae feeding on plant tissues and releasing chemicals that manipulate the plant's growth responses. The galls provide both shelter and nutrients for the developing wasp larvae. This interaction between the wasp and its host plant is an example of a complex mutualistic and parasitic relationship in botanical ecosystems."
