    "intro": "Euphorbia turbiniformis, commonly known as the Turban Spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features distinctive, thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled settings."
