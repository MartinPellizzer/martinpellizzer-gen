    "intro": "Epidendrum orchidiflorum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. The flowers are highly fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
