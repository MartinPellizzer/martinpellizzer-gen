    "intro": "Equisetum praealtum f. drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's horse tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces both sterile and fertile stems, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called strobili. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This fossiliferous plant has a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
