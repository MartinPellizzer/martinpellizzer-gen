    "intro": "Eremia rhodopis, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Eremia rhodopis is often found in sandy soils and is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
