    "intro": "Eleocharis subnodulosa, commonly known as the nodular spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that typically bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that are dispersed by water or wind. Eleocharis subnodulosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
