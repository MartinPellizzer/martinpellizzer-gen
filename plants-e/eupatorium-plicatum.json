    "intro": "Eupatorium plicatum, commonly known as narrowleaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
