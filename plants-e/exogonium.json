    "intro": "Exogonium, commonly known as the \"false bulb\" of certain orchids, is a specialized structure that plays a crucial role in the plant's vegetative propagation. It is a type of underground stem that stores nutrients and water, allowing the plant to survive adverse conditions. The exogonium develops from the base of the stem and can produce new shoots and roots, facilitating vegetative reproduction. This structure is particularly prominent in species of the genus Oncidium and other orchids. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to enhance the plant's resilience and reproductive success."
