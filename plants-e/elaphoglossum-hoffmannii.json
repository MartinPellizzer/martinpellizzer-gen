    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hoffmannii, commonly known as Hoffmann's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Elaphoglossum hoffmannii is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
