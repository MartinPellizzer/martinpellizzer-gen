    "intro": "Euphorbia lata, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, green stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritant to the skin, a feature common among many members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Euphorbia lata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
