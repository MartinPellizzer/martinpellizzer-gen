    "intro": "Eurycarpus, commonly known as the broad-fruited genus, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the family Myrtaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often showy fruits that are typically woody and contain multiple seeds. They are primarily found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Australia, where they thrive in diverse habitats such as forests and coastal areas. The leaves of Eurycarpus species are usually simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, which helps them conserve water in arid conditions. Their flowers are typically small and clustered, with a fragrant aroma that attracts various pollinators."
