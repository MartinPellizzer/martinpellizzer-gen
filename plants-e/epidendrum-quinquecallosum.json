    "intro": "Epidendrum quinquecallosum, commonly known as the five-ribbed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright, branching growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant has fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
