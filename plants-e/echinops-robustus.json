    "intro": "Echinops robustus, commonly known as the robust thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are often mistaken for tumbleweeds. The plant produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Echinops robustus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
