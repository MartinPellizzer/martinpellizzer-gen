    "intro": "Elionurus adustus, commonly known as the ash-gray sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, ash-gray pubescence, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, greenish flowers that mature to a reddish hue. Elionurus adustus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
