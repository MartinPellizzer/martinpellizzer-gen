    "intro": "Eriophorum lockhartii, commonly known as the Lockhart's cotton grass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton balls, which are composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and wet meadows. Its leaves are usually short and grass-like, and it has a low-growing habit. Eriophorum lockhartii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
