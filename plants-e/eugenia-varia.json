It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, reddish-purple berries. Eugenia varia thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
