    "intro": "Elymus lazicus subsp. divaricatus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
