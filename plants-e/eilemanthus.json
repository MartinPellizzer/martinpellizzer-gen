It is native to the Americas, particularly found in regions of South America and the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish to orange flowers that resemble candles, hence its common name. Eilemanthus species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive foliage and showy blooms. They thrive in full sun to partial shade and prefer well-drained soils."
