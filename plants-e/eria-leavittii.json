    "intro": "Eria leavittii, commonly known as the Leavitt's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Eria leavittii is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific habitat conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
