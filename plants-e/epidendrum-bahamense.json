    "intro": "Epidendrum bahamense, commonly known as the Bahamian orchid, is a species native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Bahamas. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum bahamense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
