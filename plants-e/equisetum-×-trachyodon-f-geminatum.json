    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 trachyodon f. geminatum, commonly known as the twin-stemmed horsetail, is a hybrid fern ally characterized by its distinctive, segmented stems. It features whorled leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common trait in the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are clustered in a distinctive, brush-like arrangement. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along streambanks. This variant is notable for its ability to form dense clumps through vegetative propagation, contributing to its ecological significance in certain habitats."
