    "intro": "Ericoila procumbens, commonly known as the creeping heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ericoila procumbens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
