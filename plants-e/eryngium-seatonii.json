    "intro": "Eryngium seatonii, commonly known as the Seaton's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
