    "intro": "Epilobium adnatum var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streambanks, wet meadows, and riparian areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
