    "intro": "Euphorbia khorasanica, commonly known as the Persian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, waxy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by colorful bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it."
