    "intro": "Eupatorium lloense, commonly known as the Ll\u00f3nses weed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Uruguay. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its flowers are usually purple to pink in color, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Eupatorium lloense is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
