    "intro": "Elateriospermum rhizophorum, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy habitats. Elateriospermum rhizophorum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland ecosystem."
