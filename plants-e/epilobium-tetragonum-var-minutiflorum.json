    "intro": "Epilobium tetragonum var. minutiflorum, commonly known as narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and damp woodlands. The plant features slender, quadrangular stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is an important plant in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
