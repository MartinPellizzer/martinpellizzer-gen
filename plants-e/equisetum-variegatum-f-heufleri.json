    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum f. heufleri, commonly known as the variegated horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage. This fern-like plant features whorled, segmented stems that are typically green with a yellow or brownish tint. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic typical of many primitive plants. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies."
