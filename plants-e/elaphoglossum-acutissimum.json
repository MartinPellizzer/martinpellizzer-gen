    "intro": "Elaphoglossum acutissimum, commonly known as the sharp-pointed harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Elaphoglossum acutissimum is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
