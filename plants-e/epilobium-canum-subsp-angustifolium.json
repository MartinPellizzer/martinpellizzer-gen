It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and roadside ditches. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrowly elliptic with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are pink to reddish-purple, arranged in spike-like clusters, and bloom from June to August. The plant is often found in wet or semi-aquatic environments and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils."
