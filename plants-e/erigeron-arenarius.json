    "intro": "Erigeron arenarius, commonly known as the sand heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in shades of pink to lavender, often in clusters, and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
