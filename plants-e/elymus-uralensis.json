    "intro": "Elymus uralensis, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing several small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Elymus uralensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
