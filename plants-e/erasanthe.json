    "intro": "Erasanthe, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. Erasanthe thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and compact growth habit."
