It features thick, ribbed stems and produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures. The plant has a dense, spiny foliage that helps it retain water in arid conditions. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a striking addition to xeriscaped gardens."
