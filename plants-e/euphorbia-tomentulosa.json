    "intro": "Euphorbia tomentulosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, providing a unique texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
