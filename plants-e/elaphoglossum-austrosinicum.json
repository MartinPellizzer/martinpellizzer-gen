    "intro": "Elaphoglossum austrosinicum, commonly known as the southern China holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
