    "intro": "Eupatorium racemosum, commonly known as marsh boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from July to September. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Eupatorium racemosum thrives in moist soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks."
