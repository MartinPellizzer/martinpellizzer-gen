    "intro": "Euonymus radicans var. villosus, commonly known as the woolly creeper or hairy woodbine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing stems that can grow along the ground or climb structures, often forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and typically have a soft, velvety texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
