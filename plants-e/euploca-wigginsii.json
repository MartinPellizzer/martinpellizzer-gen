    "intro": "Euploca wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins' euploca, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Euploca wigginsii is an annual herb that blooms from late spring to early summer, contributing to the biodiversity of its coastal habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
