It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland or aquatic environments, often found in marshes and along waterways. Its seeds are small and dispersed by water, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems."
