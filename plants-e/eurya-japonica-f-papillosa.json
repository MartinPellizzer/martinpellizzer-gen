    "intro": "Eurya japonica f. papillosa, commonly known as the Japanese waxleaf eurya, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, wax-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and winter interest. The species is well-suited for shady gardens and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
