    "intro": "Eucalyptus portuensis, commonly known as the Portuensis gum tree, is a tall, slender eucalyptus species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The tree produces small, globular flowers that are typically pale or creamy white, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, and is often found in heathlands and coastal forests. The essential oils from its leaves are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
