    "intro": "Elaphoglossum paxense, commonly known as the Pax's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Elaphoglossum paxense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
