It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving the plant its common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences, producing a showy display during the growing season. Eriotheca species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries like Brazil and Mexico. These plants are often valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their unique foliage and ability to thrive in warm climates."
