    "intro": "Epilobium macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks, roadsides, and wet meadows. The plant features erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface. It produces showy pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
