    "intro": "Euphorbia ruscifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Euphorbia ruscifolia is considered a valuable native plant for ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
