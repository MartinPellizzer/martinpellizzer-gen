    "intro": "Espeletia spectabilis, commonly known as the \"Puya spectabilis,\" is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette, storing water in its arid environment. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, dry climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Espeletia spectabilis is often found in cloud forests and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of the Andes."
