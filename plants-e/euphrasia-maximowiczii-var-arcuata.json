It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. This variant is distinguished by its curved, arcuate petals, which give it its common name."
