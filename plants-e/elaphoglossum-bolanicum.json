    "intro": "Elaphoglossum bolanicum, commonly known as the Bolan fern, is a species of polypodioid fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, often recurved shape. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typically in a linear arrangement. Elaphoglossum bolanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
