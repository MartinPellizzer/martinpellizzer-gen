    "intro": "Erica banksia, commonly known as the banksia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae, native to southern Australia. These shrubs or trees are characterized by their distinctive cylindrical or spikelike inflorescences, which are often brightly colored and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in the dry, nutrient-poor soils of their native habitat. Erica banksia species are also known for their hard, woody cones that persist on the plant for many years, providing a unique feature in the landscape. The genus is particularly important in the ecological systems of Australia, supporting a wide range of wildlife."
