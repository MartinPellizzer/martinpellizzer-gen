    "intro": "Echinocactus longihamatus var. deflexispinus, commonly known as the deflexispinus hedgehog cactus, is a spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its dense, white to pale blue hairs that cover the stems and flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
