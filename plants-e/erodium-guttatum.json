It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant features slender stems covered in fine hairs and has small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly sticky surface. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant often grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields.
