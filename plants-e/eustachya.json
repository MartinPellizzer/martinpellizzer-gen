    "intro": "Eustachya, commonly known as the panic grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are typically perennial herbs with slender, tufted growth habits and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Eustachya species often have narrow, grass-like leaves and are adapted to a variety of soil types. They are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
