    "intro": "Ephippiorhynchium longirostre var. amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian long-beaked fern, is a rare and specialized plant found in the dense rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its elongated, narrow fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in the understory of the forest. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
