    "intro": "Evax rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf evax, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its round, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
