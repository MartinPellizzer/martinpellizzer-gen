    "intro": "Erica patens, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica patens is part of the Ericaceae family, which includes other heath and heather plants. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
