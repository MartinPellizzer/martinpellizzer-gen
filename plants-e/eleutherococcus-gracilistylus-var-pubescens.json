    "intro": "Eleutherococcus gracilistylus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy-styled eleutherococcus, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the eleutherococcus genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and the Russian Far East. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in late summer, followed by the production of small, red berries. This variant is valued for its potential adaptogenic properties, though it remains understudied compared to other eleutherococcus species."
