    "intro": "Eugenia lepida, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Eugenia lepida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
