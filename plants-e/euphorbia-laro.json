    "intro": "Euphorbia laro, commonly known as the red-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often the only visible part of the inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
