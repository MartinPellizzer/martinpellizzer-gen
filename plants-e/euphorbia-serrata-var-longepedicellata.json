It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often spiny and serrated, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
