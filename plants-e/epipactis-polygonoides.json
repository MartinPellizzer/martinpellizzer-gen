    "intro": "Epipactis polygonoides, commonly known as the lesser marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, meadows, and woodland edges. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in association with other orchid species. The flower has a complex structure with a three-lobed lip and is pollinated by insects, particularly bees and wasps."
