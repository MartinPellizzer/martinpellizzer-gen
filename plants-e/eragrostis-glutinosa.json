    "intro": "Eragrostis glutinosa, commonly known as sticky bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, sticky spikelets. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to thrive in poor soils and harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Eragrostis glutinosa is often found in grasslands, shrublands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
