    "intro": "Elymus multinodus, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession. Elymus multinodus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
