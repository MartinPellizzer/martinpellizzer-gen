    "intro": "Euphorbia saxorum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, green stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and sometimes spiny, providing additional protection against herbivores. Euphorbia saxorum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
