It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the production of elongated, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically features strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
