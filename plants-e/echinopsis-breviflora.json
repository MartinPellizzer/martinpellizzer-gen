    "intro": "Echinopsis breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered cactus or the white moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a succulent plant, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis breviflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habits."
