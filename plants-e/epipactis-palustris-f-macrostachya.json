    "intro": "Epipactis palustris f. macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stalked marsh helleborine, is a variant of the marsh helleborine, a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This orchid is known for its ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
