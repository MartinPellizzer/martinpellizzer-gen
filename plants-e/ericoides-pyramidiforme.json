    "intro": "Ericoides pyramidiforme, commonly known as the pyramidal heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving the plant a dense, shrub-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Ericoides pyramidiforme is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate coastal conditions, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
