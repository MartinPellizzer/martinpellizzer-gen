    "intro": "Echinopsis saltensis var. pseudocachensis, commonly known as the Cachanilla cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a thick, ribbed structure that helps it store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in cactus gardens."
