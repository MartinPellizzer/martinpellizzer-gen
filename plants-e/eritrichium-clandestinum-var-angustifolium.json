    "intro": "Eritrichium clandestinum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, hairy stems and clustered leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in loose clusters, often appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas. This species is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, making it a common weed in certain regions."
