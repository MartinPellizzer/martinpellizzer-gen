    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tint. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it."
