    "intro": "Eugenia nodosa, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, dark purple to black berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil stabilization in coastal areas. Eugenia nodosa plays a vital role in coastal protection and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
