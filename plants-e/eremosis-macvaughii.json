The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are yellow and are arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
