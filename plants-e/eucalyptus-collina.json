    "intro": "Eucalyptus collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and small, narrow leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus collina is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland areas. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
