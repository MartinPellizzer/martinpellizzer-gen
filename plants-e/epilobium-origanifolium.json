    "intro": "Epilobium origanifolium, commonly known as the woolly willow or mountain willow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as streambanks and forest edges. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine white tomentum. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and arranged in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native environment."
