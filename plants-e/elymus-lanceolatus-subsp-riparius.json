    "intro": "Elymus lanceolatus subsp. riparius, commonly known as river wildrye, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
