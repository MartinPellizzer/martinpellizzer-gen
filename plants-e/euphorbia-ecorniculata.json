    "intro": "Euphorbia ecorniculata, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, spiny tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems to survive drought conditions. Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
