    "intro": "Elymus ambiguus var. salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high salinity and drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in soils with high salt content, often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and saline soils. This hardy plant plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife in its native range."
