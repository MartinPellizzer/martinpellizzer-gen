    "intro": "Euphorbia spinosa subsp. glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
