    "intro": "Eucalyptus gunnii var. undulata, commonly known as the undulating mallees, is a variant of the grey box tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
