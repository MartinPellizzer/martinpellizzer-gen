    "intro": "Elaphoglossum glossophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Elaphoglossum glossophyllum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its delicate foliage makes it a desirable addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
