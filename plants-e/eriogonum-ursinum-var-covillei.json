    "intro": "Eriogonum ursinum var. covillei, commonly known as Coville\u2019s buckbrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and sagebrush communities. The plant features dense clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Coville\u2019s buckbrush is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
