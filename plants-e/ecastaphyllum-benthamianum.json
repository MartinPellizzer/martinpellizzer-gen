It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain small, hard seeds. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
