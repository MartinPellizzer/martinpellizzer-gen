It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
