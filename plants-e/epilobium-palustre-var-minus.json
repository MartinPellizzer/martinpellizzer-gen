    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. minus, commonly known as narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width. The flowers are small, pink to reddish, and clustered in spikes, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its reduced leaf size and more compact growth habit."
