    "intro": "Epipactis greuteri var. aspromontana, commonly known as the Aspromontana helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flower with a pale yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It produces a single, fragrant flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
