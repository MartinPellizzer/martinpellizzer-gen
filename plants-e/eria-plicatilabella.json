It is characterized by its unique pleated leaves, which give it its common name and contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking foliage and delicate blooms, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
