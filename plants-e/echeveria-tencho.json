    "intro": "Echeveria tencho, commonly known as the Tencho Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray or green in color. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces vibrant purple or pink flowers in the spring, adding ornamental value to the plant. This species is well-suited for rock gardens or container planting due to its compact size and drought tolerance."
