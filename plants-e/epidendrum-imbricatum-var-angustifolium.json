    "intro": "Epidendrum imbricatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in a home setting."
