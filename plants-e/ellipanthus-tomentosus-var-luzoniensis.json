    "intro": "Ellipanthus tomentosus var. luzoniensis, commonly known as the Luzon velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
