    "intro": "Eleusine indica var. sandaensis, commonly known as sandaensis lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and is often found in sandy or disturbed soils. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in challenging conditions. This variety is sometimes used for forage or erosion control due to its hardiness and growth patterns."
