    "intro": "Echium humile var. subtrygorrhizum, commonly known as the narrow-rooted thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid habitats. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact root system compared to other echium species."
