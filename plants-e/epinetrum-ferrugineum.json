It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a rusty brown or reddish hue, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. Epinetrum ferrugineum is often found in rocky or limestone areas, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
