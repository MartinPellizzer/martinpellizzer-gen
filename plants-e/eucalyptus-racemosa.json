    "intro": "Eucalyptus racemosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in regions with low rainfall. Eucalyptus racemosa is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have various traditional and commercial uses."
