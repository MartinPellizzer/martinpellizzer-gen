    "intro": "Eugenia nigrans, commonly known as black eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are rich in antioxidants and are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a strong aromatic scent when crushed. Eugenia nigrans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and seasonal fruiting."
