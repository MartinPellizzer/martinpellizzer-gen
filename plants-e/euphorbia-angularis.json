    "intro": "Euphorbia angularis, commonly known as the angular spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with its angular, ribbed stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique shape and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Euphorbia angularis prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure for optimal growth."
