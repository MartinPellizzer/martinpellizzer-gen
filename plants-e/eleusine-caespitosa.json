    "intro": "Eleusine caespitosa, commonly known as lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Eleusine caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
