    "intro": "Entada, commonly known as the \"screw tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its long, spiral-shaped pods that twist around the stem, giving it its common name. The plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They typically grow as trees or shrubs, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The seeds are enclosed in these unique, coiled pods and are often dispersed by animals or through wind."
