    "intro": "Eriocaulon stellare, commonly known as star sedge, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Eriocaulon stellare is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
