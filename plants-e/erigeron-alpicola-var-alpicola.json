    "intro": "Erigeron alpicola var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine fleabane, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid, mountainous habitat. It grows in open meadows and rocky slopes, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is a common sight in alpine ecosystems."
