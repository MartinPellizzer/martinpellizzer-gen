It is characterized by its dense, grey-green foliage and produces clusters of pink to red tubular flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to dry, sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of native pollinators, including bees and birds."
