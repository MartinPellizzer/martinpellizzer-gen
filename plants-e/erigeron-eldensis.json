It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are usually pale blue to white, with a central yellow disk, and bloom during the summer months. Erigeron eldensis is often found in high-altitude environments, where it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
