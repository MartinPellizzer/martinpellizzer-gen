    "intro": "Eustachys bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahamian grass, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region, particularly the Bahamas. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting well to saline and well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, allowing it to withstand wind and salt spray. Eustachys bahiensis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
