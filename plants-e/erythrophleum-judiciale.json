    "intro": "Erythrophleum judiciale, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber used in construction and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
