    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum f. pallidum, commonly known as the pale variegated horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila at the top of its stems, which are often reddish in hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ancient lineage make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in wetland habitats."
