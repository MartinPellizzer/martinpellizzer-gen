    "intro": "Elaphoglossum tambillense var. major, commonly known as the giant elaphoglossum, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant exhibits a complex frond structure with a long, narrow stalk and multiple pinnae, which are the smaller leaflets. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests."
