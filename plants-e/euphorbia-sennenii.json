    "intro": "Euphorbia sennenii, commonly known as the silver spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems covered in a distinctive silvery-gray waxy coating. The leaves are small, oval, and often shed as the plant matures, giving it a spiny appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the plant's unique flower-like structures. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
