    "intro": "Ecclinusa cochlearia, commonly known as the common helleborine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking, hooded flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with purple veins, and it produces small, dark brown seeds in a capsule. Ecclinusa cochlearia is also known for its ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
