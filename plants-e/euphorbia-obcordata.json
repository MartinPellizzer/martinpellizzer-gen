    "intro": "Euphorbia obcordata, commonly known as the heartleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, obcordate (heart-shaped) leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its succulent nature, it is adapted to store water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant."
