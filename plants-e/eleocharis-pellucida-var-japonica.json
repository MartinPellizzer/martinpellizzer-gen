    "intro": "Eleocharis pellucida var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and provide habitat for aquatic life."
