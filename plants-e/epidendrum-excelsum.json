    "intro": "Epidendrum excelsum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to tropical regions of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, yellow, and orange. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Epidendrum excelsum thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and size make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
