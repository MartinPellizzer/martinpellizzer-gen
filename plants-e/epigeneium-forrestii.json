    "intro": "Epigeneium forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's epigeneium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth where it relies on specific humidity and light conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
