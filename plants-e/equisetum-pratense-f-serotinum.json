    "intro": "Equisetum pratense f. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering field horsetail, is a variant of the common field horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, herbaceous stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces sporangia in late summer, distinguishing it from the typical flowering time of its species. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This fern-like plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
