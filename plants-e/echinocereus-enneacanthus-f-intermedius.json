    "intro": "Echinocereus enneacanthus f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
