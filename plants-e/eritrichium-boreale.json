    "intro": "Eritrichium boreale, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with dense foliage that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which reduces water loss in arid conditions. Eritrichium boreale is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common sight in tundra and rocky habitats."
