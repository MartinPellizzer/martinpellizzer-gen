It features a slender, erect stem with several elongated, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Eulophia falcatiloba is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found growing in humid, tropical climates."
