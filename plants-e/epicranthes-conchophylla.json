    "intro": "Epicranthes conchophylla, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, humid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found growing along shorelines and in mangrove swamps. Due to its salt tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
