    "intro": "Erica articularis var. articularis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coasts of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure and strong winds. Erica articularis var. articularis is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing dune environments."
