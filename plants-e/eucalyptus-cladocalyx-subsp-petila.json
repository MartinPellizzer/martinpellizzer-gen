It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
