    "intro": "Euphorbia armena, commonly known as Armenian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its branched stems and fleshy, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though its latex can be toxic."
