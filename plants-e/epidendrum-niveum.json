    "intro": "Epidendrum niveum, commonly known as the White Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Epidendrum niveum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
