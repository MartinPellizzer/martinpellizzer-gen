    "intro": "Euphorbia officinarum subsp. beaumieriana, commonly known as the Beaufort euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching into a tree-like form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its ability to store water in its stem allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
