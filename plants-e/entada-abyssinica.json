    "intro": "Entada abyssinica, commonly known as the African tamarind tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-bark and large, palmately compound leaves. The tree produces long, slender pods that contain flat, kidney-shaped seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell and are often used in traditional medicine. It is also valued for its timber and as a source of tannins."
