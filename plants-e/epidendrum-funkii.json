    "intro": "Epidendrum funkii, commonly known as the Funk's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and support the plant's growth, while its leaves are long and strap-like. Epidendrum funkii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
