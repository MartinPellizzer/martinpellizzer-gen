It features upright, branching stems that are typically covered in a pale greenish-white latex. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a waxy texture, often with a slight bluish tinge. Its flowers are small and clustered in complex structures called cyathia, which are yellowish-green and surrounded by bracts. This plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
