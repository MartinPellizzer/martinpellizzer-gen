    "intro": "Echinocereus stramineus subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Prickly Pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny, greenish-yellow to reddish-brown areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
