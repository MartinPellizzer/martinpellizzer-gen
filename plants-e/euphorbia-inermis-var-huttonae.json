    "intro": "Euphorbia inermis var. huttonae, commonly known as Hutton's spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry environments."
