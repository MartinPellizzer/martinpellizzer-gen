    "intro": "Euonymus longipedicellatus, commonly known as the long-pedicellate woodbine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cistaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing or trailing stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
