    "intro": "Elaeocarpus tuasivicus, commonly known as the Tausi fig, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tonga and Samoa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe. Its fruits are an important food source for various bird species, contributing to seed dispersal. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
