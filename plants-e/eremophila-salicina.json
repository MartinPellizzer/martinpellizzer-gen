It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eremophila salicina is often used in native gardens due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
