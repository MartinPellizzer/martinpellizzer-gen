It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its dense, fluffy clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are generally narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or secondary successional habitats."
