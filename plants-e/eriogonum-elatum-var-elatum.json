It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats. It is drought-tolerant and plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Its botanical features make it an important component of arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
