    "intro": "Elymus nodosus subsp. nodosus, commonly known as the nodding needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
