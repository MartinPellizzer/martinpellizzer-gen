    "intro": "Epilobium simulans, commonly known as the mimic willow or false willow, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Epilobium simulans typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
