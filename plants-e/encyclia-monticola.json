    "intro": "Encyclia monticola, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinct lip petal. Encyclia monticola thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and adaptation to mountainous habitats make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
