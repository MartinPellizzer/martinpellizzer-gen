    "intro": "Echites glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular echites, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical or subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
