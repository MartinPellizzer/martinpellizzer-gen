It is characterized by its tall, jointed stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically clustered in dense, spike-like formations. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This ancient plant has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years, showcasing its evolutionary resilience."
