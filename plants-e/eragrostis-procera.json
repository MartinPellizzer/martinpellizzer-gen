    "intro": "Eragrostis procera, commonly known as tall false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Eragrostis procera is often used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to establish dense root systems."
