    "intro": "Epidendrum platyoon, commonly known as the flat-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum platyoon is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
