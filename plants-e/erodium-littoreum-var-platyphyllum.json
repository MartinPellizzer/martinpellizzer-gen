    "intro": "Erodium littoreum var. platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved seaside purslane, is a low-growing annual herb native to coastal regions of southern California. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are broadly ovate and often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the coast. This species is well adapted to saline and windy environments, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and beach habitats."
