    "intro": "Eriophorum cyperinum var. eriophorum, commonly known as the cotton grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fluffy, silver-white seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as bogs, marshes, and roadside ditches. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually green and grow in dense tufts. Eriophorum cyperinum var. eriophorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
