    "intro": "Eugenia koepperi, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the winter months. The plant produces small, red, bell-shaped fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Eugenia koepperi is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in containers or as part of a tropical garden."
