    "intro": "Erodendrum foetidum, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and stream banks. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
