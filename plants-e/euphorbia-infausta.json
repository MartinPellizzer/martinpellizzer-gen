    "intro": "Euphorbia infausta, commonly known as the cursed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant contains toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation and is harmful if ingested. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and is considered a challenging plant to handle."
