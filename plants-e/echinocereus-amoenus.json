    "intro": "Echinocereus amoenus, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and its ability to produce vibrant, star-shaped flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, open in response to cooler temperatures and moonlight. Echinocereus amoenus is well adapted to desert conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry climates."
