It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
