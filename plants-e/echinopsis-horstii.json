    "intro": "Echinopsis horstii, commonly known as the Horstii Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, specifically Argentina. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a short, thick stem and a crown of white to pale blue flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid environments, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring, and are often visited by nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a popular choice for both horticultural and botanical study."
