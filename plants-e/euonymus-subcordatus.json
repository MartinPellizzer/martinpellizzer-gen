    "intro": "Euonymus subcordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. Euonymus subcordatus is relatively low-maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for gardeners."
