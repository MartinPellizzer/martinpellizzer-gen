    "intro": "Epilobium hirsutum subsp. foliosum, commonly known as the woolly willow or hairy willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, often boggy habitats, such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its stems are often covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
