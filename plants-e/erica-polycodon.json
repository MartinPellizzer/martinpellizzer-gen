    "intro": "Erica polycodon, commonly known as the many-toothed heath, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family (Ericaceae). It is native to the Western Cape region of South Africa, where it typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Erica polycodon is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
