    "intro": "Eugenia fulvescens, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, segmented fruits with a bright red outer rind. The fruit's interior contains a juicy, white or yellowish pulp that is rich in antioxidants and has a sweet, tart flavor. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its culinary and medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
