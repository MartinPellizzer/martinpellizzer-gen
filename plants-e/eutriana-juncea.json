    "intro": "Eutriana juncea, commonly known as the slender waterwheel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering pollutants. Eutriana juncea is also an important food source for various aquatic insects and wildlife."
