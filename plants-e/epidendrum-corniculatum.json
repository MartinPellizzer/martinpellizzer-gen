    "intro": "Epidendrum corniculatum, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often hanging from trees in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to aid in water retention. Epidendrum corniculatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
