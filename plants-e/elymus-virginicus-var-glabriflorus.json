    "intro": "Elymus virginicus var. glabriflorus, commonly known as the smoothflower bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist to mesic habitats. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are typically glabrous or nearly hairless, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside ditches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
