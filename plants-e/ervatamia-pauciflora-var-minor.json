    "intro": "Ervatamia pauciflora var. minor, commonly known as the lesser ervatamia, is a rare and low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy yet delicate species. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
