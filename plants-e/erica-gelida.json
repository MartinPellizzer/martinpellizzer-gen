    "intro": "Erica gelida, commonly known as the frost heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica gelida thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
