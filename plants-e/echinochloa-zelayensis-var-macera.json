    "intro": "Echinochloa zelayensis var. macera, commonly known as red rice, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats and is often found in rice paddies. Its seeds are similar in appearance to cultivated rice, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Due to its competitive nature, it can significantly impact rice yields if not controlled."
