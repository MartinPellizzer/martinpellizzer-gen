    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. decumbens, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant is typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in wetlands, and in agricultural fields. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its stems often produce new shoots from the base. This variety is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit, with stems lying close to the ground."
