    "intro": "Eusteralis kachinensis, commonly known as the Kachin star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that display a unique combination of colors, often featuring a mix of white, yellow, and purple. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, where it thrives in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, which are attracted by their nectar-rich structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eusteralis kachinensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
