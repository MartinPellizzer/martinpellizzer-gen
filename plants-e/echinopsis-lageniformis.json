    "intro": "Echinopsis lageniformis, commonly known as the giant white torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to three meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers during the night, which are pollinated by bats and other nocturnal insects. Its stems are covered in spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Echinopsis lageniformis is a succulent, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in its harsh environment."
