It is characterized by its woody stems and small, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red or orange berries. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Euclea asperrima is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
