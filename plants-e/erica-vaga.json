    "intro": "Erica vaga, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact form and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, usually blooming from late summer to early autumn. Erica vaga thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
