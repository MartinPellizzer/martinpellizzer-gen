    "intro": "Eugenia subglauca, commonly known as the silverleaf eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its greyish-blue, papery bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, which bloom in spring. Its fruits are woody capsules that release small, dark seeds when mature. Eugenia subglauca is often found in coastal and heathland environments, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
