    "intro": "Epidendrum glumarum, commonly known as the yellow-veined epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and relatively short, fleshy pseudobulbs. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers with contrasting green veins, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Epidendrum glumarum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate to high humidity for optimal growth. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
