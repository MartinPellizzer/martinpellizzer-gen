It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Elleanthus ollgaardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
