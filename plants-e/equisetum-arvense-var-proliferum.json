    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. proliferum, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late spring to early summer. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. The presence of silica deposits in its stems gives it a rough, abrasive texture."
