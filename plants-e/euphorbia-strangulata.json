    "intro": "Euphorbia strangulata, commonly known as the strangler euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a branching stem system with a distinctive appearance, often resembling a tree or shrub. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by colorful bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, making it a hardy species suitable for xerophytic gardens."
