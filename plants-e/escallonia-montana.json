    "intro": "Escallonia montana, commonly known as the mountain escallonia, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates. Escallonia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and birds."
