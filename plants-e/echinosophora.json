    "intro": "Echinosophora, commonly known as the spiny sophora, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are often covered in small, spiny structures. The flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes, with a distinctive pea-like shape typical of the Fabaceae family. Echinosophora species are native to various regions in Asia, particularly China, where they grow in forested areas. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
