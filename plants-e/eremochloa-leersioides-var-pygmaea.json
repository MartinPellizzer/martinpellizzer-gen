    "intro": "Eremochloa leersioides var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf false brome, is a small perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it a low-growing plant with dense, tufted foliage. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its compact size and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
