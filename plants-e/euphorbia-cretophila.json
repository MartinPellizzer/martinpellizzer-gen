    "intro": "Euphorbia cretophila, commonly known as the cretaceous euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
