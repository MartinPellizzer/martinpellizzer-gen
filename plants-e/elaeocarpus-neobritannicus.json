    "intro": "Elaeocarpus neobritannicus, commonly known as the New Britain elaeocarp, is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is native to the Pacific islands, particularly New Britain in the Bismarck Archipelago. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a habitat and food source. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
