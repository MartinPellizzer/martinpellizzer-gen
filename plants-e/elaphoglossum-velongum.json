    "intro": "Elaphoglossum velongum, commonly known as the long-stemmed harts-tongue fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Elaphoglossum velongum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
