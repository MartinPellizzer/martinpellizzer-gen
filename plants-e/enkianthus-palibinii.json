    "intro": "Enkianthus palibinii, commonly known as the Palibinii enkianthus, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, providing a striking contrast. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Enkianthus palibinii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
