    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. dolosum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green or yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobili at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
