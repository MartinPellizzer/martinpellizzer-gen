    "intro": "Esterhazya splendida f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed splendid esterhazya, is a rare and ornamental plant belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, with a unique blend of red and yellow hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
