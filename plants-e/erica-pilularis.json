    "intro": "Erica pilularis, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Erica pilularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
