    "intro": "Erica equisetifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is well adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Erica equisetifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
