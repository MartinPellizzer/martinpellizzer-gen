    "intro": "Euonymus fortunei var. fortunei, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that often have a slight yellowish tinge beneath. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in landscaping. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is widely cultivated in temperate regions."
