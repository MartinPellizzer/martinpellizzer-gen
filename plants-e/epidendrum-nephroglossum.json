    "intro": "Epidendrum nephroglossum, commonly known as the \"Cupleaf Epidendrum,\" is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, cup-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. The species is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in its native habitats."
