    "intro": "Erigeron glabellus var. viscidus, commonly known as sticky blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, viscid (sticky) stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and contribute to its ecological role in its native range."
