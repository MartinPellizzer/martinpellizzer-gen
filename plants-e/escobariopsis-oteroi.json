    "intro": "Escobariopsis oteroi, commonly known as the Oteroi's spiky moss, is a rare and delicate liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, thalloid structure with a dense network of leaf-like structures called phyllids. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Escobariopsis oteroi is known for its unique morphology, featuring small, spiky projections on its surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
