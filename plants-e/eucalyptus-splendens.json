    "intro": "Eucalyptus splendens, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a tall, ornamental tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a striking red or orange hue beneath. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green appearance. Eucalyptus splendens is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
