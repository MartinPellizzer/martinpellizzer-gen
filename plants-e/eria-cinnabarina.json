    "intro": "Eria cinnabarina, commonly known as the red orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique coloration and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical studies."
