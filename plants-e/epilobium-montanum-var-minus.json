    "intro": "Epilobium montanum var. minus, commonly known as the alpine willow or mountain willow, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia. The plant features slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in clusters. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soils, making it a characteristic species of alpine vegetation. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
