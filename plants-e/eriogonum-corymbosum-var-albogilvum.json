    "intro": "Eriogonum corymbosum var. albogilvum, commonly known as the whiteleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a whitish or grayish coating, which helps reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
