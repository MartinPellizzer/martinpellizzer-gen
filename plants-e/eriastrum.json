    "intro": "Eriastrum, commonly known as sticky blueweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. Eriastrum species are characterized by their small, blue or purple flowers and hairy, often sticky leaves. They are low-growing shrubs or herbs that often form dense mats, which helps them conserve moisture in dry environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
