    "intro": "Erica eremioides subsp. eglandula, commonly known as the glandless heath, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
