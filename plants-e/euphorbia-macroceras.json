    "intro": "Euphorbia macroceras, commonly known as the giant candleplant, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to the Canary Islands and features a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, yellow-orange cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the genus Euphorbia. Its waxy, succulent leaves are arranged in a rosette at the base, and the plant is known for its ability to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Euphorbia macroceras is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and architectural form."
