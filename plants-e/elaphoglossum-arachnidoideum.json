    "intro": "Elaphoglossum arachnidoideum, commonly known as the spider-like holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble spider legs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often slightly curled or twisted. Elaphoglossum arachnidoideum is a relatively small fern, with a compact growth habit and is often found in montane or subalpine regions."
