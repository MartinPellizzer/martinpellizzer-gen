    "intro": "Echinothamnus pechuelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, woody shrub form. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Echinothamnus pechuelii is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments."
