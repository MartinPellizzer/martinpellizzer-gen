    "intro": "Euphorbia incana, commonly known as the hardy spurge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically alternate and can be either simple or lobed, depending on the variety. Euphorbia incana is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
