    "intro": "Eranthemum ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous eranthemum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season. However, it is relatively uncommon in horticultural trade compared to other members of its family."
