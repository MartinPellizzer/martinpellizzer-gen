    "intro": "Euphorbia rhombifolia var. triceps, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
