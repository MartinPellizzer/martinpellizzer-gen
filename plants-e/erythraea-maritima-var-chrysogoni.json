    "intro": "Erythraea maritima var. chrysogoni, commonly known as the goldenleaf sea heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Europe. It typically features small, leathery leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and harsh maritime conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
