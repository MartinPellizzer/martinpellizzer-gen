    "intro": "Euphorbia nyikae, commonly known as the Nyika spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
