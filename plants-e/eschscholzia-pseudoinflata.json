It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Eschscholzia pseudoinflata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to dry conditions with its deep root system."
