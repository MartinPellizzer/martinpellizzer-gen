    "intro": "Erigeron vahlii, commonly known as the Vahl's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Erigeron vahlii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
