    "intro": "Elaeagnus oldhamii var. obovata, commonly known as the Chinese silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery foliage, which results from the dense covering of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that ripen in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils. The species is also valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
