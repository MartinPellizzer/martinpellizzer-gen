    "intro": "Euphorbia erosa, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically lance-shaped with a smooth margin. Euphorbia erosa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions."
