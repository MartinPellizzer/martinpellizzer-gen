    "intro": "Echinopsis huascha var. auricolor, commonly known as the golden echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its globular shape and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived but striking, often attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. This variety is prized in horticulture for its unique coloration and relatively easy care requirements."
