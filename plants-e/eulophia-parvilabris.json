    "intro": "Eulophia parvilabris, commonly known as the small-lipped eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
