    "intro": "Erythrina cochleata, commonly known as the scarlet coral tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a visually striking ornamental plant. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often used in landscaping for its vibrant floral display. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
