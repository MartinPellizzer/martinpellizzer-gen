    "intro": "Elaphoglossum killipii, commonly known as the Killip's holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the humid forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that resemble those of a holly plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along stream banks or in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
