    "intro": "Eugenia lugens, commonly known as the glossy apple or Australian apple, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. These berries are often consumed by birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Eugenia lugens is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and forested areas."
