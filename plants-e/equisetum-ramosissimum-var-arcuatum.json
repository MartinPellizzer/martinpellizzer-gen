    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. arcuatum, commonly known as the creeping horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
