    "intro": "Egletes viscosa, commonly known as sticky egletes, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive texture. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in a flat, disc-like structure, typical of the Asteraceae family. Egletes viscosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
