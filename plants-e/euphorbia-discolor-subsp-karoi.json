    "intro": "Euphorbia discolor subsp. karoi, commonly known as the Karoi spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
