The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has slender, cylindrical stems covered in fine, soft hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clusters near the water's surface. Eriocaulon raipurense plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
