It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, intricate lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This orchid is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its unique floral structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species."
