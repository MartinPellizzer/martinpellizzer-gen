    "intro": "Erechtites argutus var. asper, commonly known as roughleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in prairies, roadsides, and other open areas. Its leaves are rough and hairy, giving it a distinctive texture, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for pollinators."
