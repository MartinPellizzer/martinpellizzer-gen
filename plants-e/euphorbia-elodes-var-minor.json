    "intro": "Euphorbia elodes var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or containers. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
