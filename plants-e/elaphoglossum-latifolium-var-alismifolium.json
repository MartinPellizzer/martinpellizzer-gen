    "intro": "Elaphoglossum latifolium var. alismifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed woodfern, is a variant of the broad-leaf woodfern native to the eastern United States. It is a fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually broad and have a distinctive, almost lily-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
