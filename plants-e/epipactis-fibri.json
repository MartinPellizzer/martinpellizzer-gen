It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces yellow-green flowers with a distinctive, hairy lip, which is a key feature in its classification. Epipactis fibri is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms."
