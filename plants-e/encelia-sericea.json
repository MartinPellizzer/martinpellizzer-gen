    "intro": "Encelia sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Encelia sericea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
