It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters and come in shades of white, pink, and purple. Epidendrum nematocaulon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
