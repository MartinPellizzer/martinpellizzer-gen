It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by leaf-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
