    "intro": "Euphorbia serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its spines and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
