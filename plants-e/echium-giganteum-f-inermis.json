    "intro": "Echium giganteum f. inermis, commonly known as the soft-hair echium, is a striking plant characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. It is a variant of the common giant thistle, distinguished by its lack of bracts and softer, less rigid foliage. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, this plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
