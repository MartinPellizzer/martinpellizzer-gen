    "intro": "Euphorbia tsihombensis, commonly known as the Tsihomb\u00e9 euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens."
