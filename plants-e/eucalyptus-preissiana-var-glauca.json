    "intro": "Eucalyptus preissiana var. glauca, commonly known as the silver-leafed ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish or whitish bloom, contributing to its silvery appearance. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
