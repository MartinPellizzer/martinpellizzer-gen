    "intro": "Eremogone capillaris var. capillaris, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
