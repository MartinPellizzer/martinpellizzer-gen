    "intro": "Eucalyptus cosmophylla var. rostrigera, commonly known as the red mahogany eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown bark, which peels in thin, fibrous strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a pale green underside, while the flowers are typically white or pale yellow. This species is known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and for their antiseptic properties. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and dry woodland areas."
