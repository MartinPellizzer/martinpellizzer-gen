    "intro": "Epidendrum paniculatum, commonly known as the orchid of the forest, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by insects."
