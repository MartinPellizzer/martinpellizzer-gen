    "intro": "Euphorbia eriantha, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, bluish-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
