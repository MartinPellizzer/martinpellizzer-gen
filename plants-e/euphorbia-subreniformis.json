    "intro": "Euphorbia subreniformis, commonly known as the sand verbena euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a unique, spiky inflorescence called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and resilience in harsh conditions."
