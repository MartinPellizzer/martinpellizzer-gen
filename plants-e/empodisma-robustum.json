    "intro": "Empodisma robustum, commonly known as the swamp sedgeland tussock grass, is a perennial tussock-forming grass found in wetland and swampy environments. It has a robust, upright growth habit with dense, leafy tufts that form a thick mat on the ground. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms. Empodisma robustum is well adapted to waterlogged conditions and is often found in peatlands and mire ecosystems."
