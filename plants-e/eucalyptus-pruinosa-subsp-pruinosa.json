    "intro": "Eucalyptus pruinosa subsp. pruinosa, commonly known as the silver dollar eucalyptus, is a medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
