    "intro": "Euonymus miniatus, commonly known as the dwarf boxleaf euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a dense, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split open to release seeds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Euonymus miniatus is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens due to its low maintenance requirements."
