    "intro": "Eucalyptus clandestina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which appear in late winter to early spring. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that have been used in traditional medicine and for their antiseptic properties. Eucalyptus clandestina is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils within coastal regions."
