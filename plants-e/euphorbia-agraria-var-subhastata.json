    "intro": "Euphorbia agraria var. subhastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
