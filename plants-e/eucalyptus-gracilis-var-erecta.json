It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-green hue, especially when young. It produces small, globular flower clusters in white or pale yellow, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas."
