    "intro": "Euphorbia baylissii, commonly known as the Bayliss\u2019s spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
