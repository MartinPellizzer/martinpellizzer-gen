It is characterized by its slender, smooth-barked trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters and attracting various pollinators. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for native wildlife."
