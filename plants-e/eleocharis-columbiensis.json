It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or reddish in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
