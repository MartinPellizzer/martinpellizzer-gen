    "intro": "Ervum ochroleucum, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a leguminous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Ervum ochroleucum has been used historically for forage and soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
