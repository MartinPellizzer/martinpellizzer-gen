    "intro": "Erica tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the western Cape region of South Africa, where it typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming late in the growing season. Erica tardiflora is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and requires well-drained conditions to thrive. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators."
