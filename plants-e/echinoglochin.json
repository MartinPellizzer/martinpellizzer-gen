    "intro": "Echinoglochin, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that enclose the small, daisy-like flowers. These bracts are often mistaken for leaves, giving the plant a unique appearance. Echinoglochin species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The flowers are usually blue or purple and bloom during the summer months."
