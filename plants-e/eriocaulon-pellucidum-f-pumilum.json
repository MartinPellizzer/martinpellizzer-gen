    "intro": "Eriocaulon pellucidum f. pumilum, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters near the base. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for wetland health."
