    "intro": "Echinocereus triglochidiatus subsp. huitcholensis, commonly known as the Huichol cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in clusters of spines and are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscaped landscapes."
