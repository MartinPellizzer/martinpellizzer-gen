    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus gladiatus, commonly known as the gladiolus cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that resemble those of the gladiolus, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, often brightly colored blooms in shades of pink, red, and white, which appear at the top of the stem. Its foliage consists of spiny, ribbed stems that are adapted to arid environments. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
