    "intro": "Enckea, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that resemble orchids. The plants typically have slender stems and are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Enckea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are cultivated for their unique floral displays. They thrive in humid, tropical environments and require well-draining soil and bright, indirect light."
