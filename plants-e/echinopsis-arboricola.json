    "intro": "Echinopsis arboricola, commonly known as the tree cactus, is a unique species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height, giving it a tree-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis arboricola is well-suited for cultivation in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
