    "intro": "Euphorbia clementei f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
