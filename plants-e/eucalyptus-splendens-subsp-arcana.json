    "intro": "Eucalyptus splendens subsp. arcana, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats."
