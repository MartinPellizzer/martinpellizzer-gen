    "intro": "Eulophia andamanensis, commonly known as the Andaman orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white with a distinctive greenish hue. Eulophia andamanensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
