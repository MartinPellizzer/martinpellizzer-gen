    "intro": "Eucalyptus macrocera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are small and usually white or pale blue, arranged in clusters along the branches. The plant produces woody capsules as fruit, containing numerous small, brown seeds. Eucalyptus macrocera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat."
