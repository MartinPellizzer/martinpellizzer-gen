It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance, and it produces small, pale yellow to white flowers. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Eupatorium anethifolium is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
