    "intro": "Emicocarpus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps. They are characterized by their showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the fruits are capsule-like, containing numerous seeds. Emicocarpus species are adapted to saline environments, making them important components of coastal ecosystems."
