    "intro": "Epidendrum cinnamomeum, commonly known as the cinnamon orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, cinnamon-scented flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating to retain water. Epidendrum cinnamomeum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
