    "intro": "Echinocactus pectinifer, commonly known as the woolly hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
