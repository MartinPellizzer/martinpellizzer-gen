    "intro": "Epidendrum farinosum, commonly known as the dusty epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lanceolate, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum farinosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
