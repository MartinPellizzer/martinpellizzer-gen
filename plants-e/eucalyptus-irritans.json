    "intro": "Eucalyptus irritans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are often pink or red, which appear in late winter to early spring. Its bark is rough and fibrous, peeling in strips to reveal a smoother inner layer. Eucalyptus irritans is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils."
