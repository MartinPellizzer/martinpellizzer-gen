    "intro": "Euphorbia coudercii f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, low-growing rosette of thick, fleshy, smooth, and sometimes blue-green leaves. The plant produces striking yellow cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
