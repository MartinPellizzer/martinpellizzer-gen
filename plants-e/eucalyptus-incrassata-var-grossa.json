    "intro": "Eucalyptus incrassata var. grossa, commonly known as the broad-leaved mallee, is a variant of the eucalyptus species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of greyish-white wax. The tree typically grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are usually pale or creamy white in color. The bark of this plant is typically rough and flaky, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification."
