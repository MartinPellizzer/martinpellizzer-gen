    "intro": "Encholirium bahianum, commonly known as the Bahia lily, is a striking plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Encholirium bahianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
