    "intro": "Epidendrum furvum, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, with a distinctive red or purple tip on each petal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum furvum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
