    "intro": "Echinospermum spinocarpos, commonly known as the spiny echinoseed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant features spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, hard seeds enclosed in a spiny capsule. Echinospermum spinocarpos is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems and reduced water loss mechanisms."
