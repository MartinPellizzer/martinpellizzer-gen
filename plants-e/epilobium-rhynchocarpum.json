    "intro": "Epilobium rhynchocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruited willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as along stream banks and in meadows. The plant features showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Its fruit is a small, capsule that splits open to release seeds. Epilobium rhynchocarpum is often found in wetland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
