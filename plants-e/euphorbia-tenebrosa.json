    "intro": "Euphorbia tenebrosa, commonly known as the dark euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dark green, somewhat woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-like structures containing both male and female flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in controlled settings."
