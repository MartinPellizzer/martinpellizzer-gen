    "intro": "Erythroxylum deciduum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved wild coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which are typically short and broad. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, reddish-brown capsules containing seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats at moderate elevations. Due to its relation to coca, it has been the subject of ecological and ethnobotanical studies."
