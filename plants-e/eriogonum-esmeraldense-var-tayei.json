It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, often yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
