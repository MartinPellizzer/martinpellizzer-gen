    "intro": "Euphorbia pallasii f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and a distinctive crown of spiny, club-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. The smooth, almost hairless texture of its foliage is a defining feature of this particular form."
