    "intro": "Eleocharis uniglumis subsp. sterneri, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its leaves are usually grass-like, with a smooth surface and a hollow stem structure typical of many sedges. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
