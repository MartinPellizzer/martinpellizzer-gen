    "intro": "Eria diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its two distinct leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Eria diphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
