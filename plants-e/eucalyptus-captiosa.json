    "intro": "Eucalyptus captiosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallet, is a tall, slender tree native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The tree produces small, spherical flower buds that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a mottled pattern beneath. The plant is well adapted to humid, subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
