    "intro": "Euonymus theifolius, commonly known as the thieving euonymus, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to reveal bright red seeds. Its foliage is evergreen, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Euonymus theifolius is relatively low maintenance and thrives in a variety of soil types and light conditions."
