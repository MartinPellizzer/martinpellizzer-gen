    "intro": "Erica daphniflora var. daphniflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
