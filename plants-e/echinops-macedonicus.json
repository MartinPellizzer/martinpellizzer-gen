    "intro": "Echinops macedonicus, commonly known as the Macedonian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small, white balls, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Echinops. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by the development of its characteristic seed heads. Echinops macedonicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
