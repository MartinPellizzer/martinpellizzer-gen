    "intro": "Elionurus trapnellii, commonly known as the desert lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize water loss in hot, dry conditions. Elionurus trapnellii is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
