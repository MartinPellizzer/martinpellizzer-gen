    "intro": "Epidendrum moyobambae, commonly known as the Moyobamba orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of northern Peru. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Epidendrum moyobambae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique ecological adaptations."
