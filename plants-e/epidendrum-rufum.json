    "intro": "Epidendrum rufum, commonly known as the red-tinged orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Epidendrum rufum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
