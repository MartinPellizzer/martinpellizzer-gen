    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris var. caespitosa, commonly known as the miniature owl cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico. It features a dense cluster of small, globular stems that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
