    "intro": "Euphorbia wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's spurge, is a perennial succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
