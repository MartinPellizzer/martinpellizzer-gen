    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 soguksuensis, commonly known as the Soguk Mountain helleborine, is a hybrid orchid native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often near streams or in mountainous regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and exhibits features typical of epipactis species, such as a pseudobulb and a single flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
