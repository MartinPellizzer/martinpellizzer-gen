    "intro": "Eionitis psammophila var. compactehirtella, commonly known as the compact hirtella sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing pale blue or purple hues. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
