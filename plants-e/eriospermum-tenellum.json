    "intro": "Eriospermum tenellum, commonly known as the woolly eriosperm, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and fleshy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
