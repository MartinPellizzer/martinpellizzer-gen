    "intro": "Eupatorium hagelundii, commonly known as Hagelund's boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has finely divided, aromatic leaves. It is often found in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its name is derived from the resemblance of its rigid, jointed stems to the bones of a skeleton."
