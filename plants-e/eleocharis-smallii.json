    "intro": "Eleocharis smallii, commonly known as the smallii spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet or muddy soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, unbranched stems that bear spike-like clusters of tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, contributing to its overall appearance as a low-growing, perennial plant. Eleocharis smallii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
