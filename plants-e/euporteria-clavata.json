    "intro": "Euporteria clavata, commonly known as the clavate euporteria, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, typically forming a thin, flat layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or soil in forested areas. This lichen is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
