    "intro": "Elongatia carpinterae, commonly known as the Carpintera elongated fern, is a rare and unique species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can reach up to two meters in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are typically clustered at the tips of its fronds. Elongatia carpinterae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
