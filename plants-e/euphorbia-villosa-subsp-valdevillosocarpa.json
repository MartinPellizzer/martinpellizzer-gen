    "intro": "Euphorbia villosa subsp. valdevillosocarpa, commonly known as the Valdevallosa spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features pale green, fleshy stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating. It is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates."
