    "intro": "Erythraea viridensis, commonly known as the green erythraea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
