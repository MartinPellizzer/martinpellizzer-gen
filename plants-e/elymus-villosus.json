    "intro": "Elymus villosus, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Elymus villosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
