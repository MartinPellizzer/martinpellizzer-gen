    "intro": "Erysimum helveticum var. rhaeticum, commonly known as the Rhaetian wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
