    "intro": "Erodium chium proles murcicum, commonly known as the Murcian bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in certain regions."
