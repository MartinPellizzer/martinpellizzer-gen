    "intro": "Euphorbia graminea f. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, woody stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
