    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudosimplex, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
