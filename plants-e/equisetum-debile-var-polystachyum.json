It is characterized by its jointed, flexible stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
