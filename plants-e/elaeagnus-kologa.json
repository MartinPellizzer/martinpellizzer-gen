    "intro": "Elaeagnus kologa, commonly known as the Kologa silverleaf, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that are utilized in traditional medicine. Elaeagnus kologa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It also has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root system, contributing to soil fertility."
