    "intro": "Eucalyptus trivalva, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and smooth, often fissured bark. The plant typically grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus trivalva is adapted to drought conditions and plays an important role in its native ecosystem."
