It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical specimen from threats such as habitat loss and over-collection."
