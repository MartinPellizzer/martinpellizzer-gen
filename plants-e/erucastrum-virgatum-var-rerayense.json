    "intro": "Erucastrum virgatum var. rerayense, commonly known as the Reray's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific freshwater habitats in South America. It is characterized by its small, inflated leaves that resemble bladders, which help it float and trap oxygen. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in regions with high humidity and warm temperatures. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
