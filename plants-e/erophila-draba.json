    "intro": "Erophila draba, commonly known as the lesser wall rue, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as coastal cliffs and mountain slopes. It is found throughout Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in some regions."
