It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Elaphoglossum calophyllum is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
