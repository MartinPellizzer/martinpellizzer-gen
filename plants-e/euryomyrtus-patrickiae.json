It is native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that releases minute seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Euryomyrtus patrickiae is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense understorey vegetation."
