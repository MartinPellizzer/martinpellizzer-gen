It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. The inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-bearing clusters, which are often tinged with reddish hues."
