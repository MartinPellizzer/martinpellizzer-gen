It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and opposite, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in moist, woodland areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Eupatorium brickelloides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
