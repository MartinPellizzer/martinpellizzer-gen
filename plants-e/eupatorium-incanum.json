It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. Eupatorium incanum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
