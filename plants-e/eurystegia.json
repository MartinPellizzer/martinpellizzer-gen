    "intro": "Eurystegia, commonly known as the rock heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. They are native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia. Eurystegia species often thrive in rocky or well-drained soils, preferring acidic conditions. Their ornamental value makes them popular in horticulture, especially in rock gardens and as ground cover."
