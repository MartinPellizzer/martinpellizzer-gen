    "intro": "Elaeoselinum exinvolucratum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that help conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It has a succulent habit, adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
