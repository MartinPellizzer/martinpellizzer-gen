    "intro": "Esdra sessilis, commonly known as the sessile esdra, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically opposite and sessile, meaning they lack stalks, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical habitats."
