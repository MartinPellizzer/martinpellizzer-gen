    "intro": "Eremophila serpens, commonly known as the serpentine eremophila, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, hairy layer to reduce water loss. Eremophila serpens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
