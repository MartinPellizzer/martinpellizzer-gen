    "intro": "Euphorbia friedrichiae subsp. pofadderensis, commonly known as the Pofadder euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to harsh, dry conditions."
