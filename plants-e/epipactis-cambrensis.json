    "intro": "Epipactis cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Wales and western England. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features a rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, hooded flowers with a distinctive lip. Its flowering period occurs between June and August, and it is pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps. Epipactis cambrensis is listed as a priority species in the UK due to its declining population and conservation significance."
