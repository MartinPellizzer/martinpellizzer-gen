    "intro": "Ebnerella bocasana, commonly known as the Bocasana fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Ebnerella bocasana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
