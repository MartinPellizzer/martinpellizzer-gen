    "intro": "Euproboscis, commonly known as the long-tongued plant, is a unique species characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers. These flowers are specifically adapted to accommodate the long proboscis of its primary pollinators, such as certain species of moths. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. The plant's most striking feature is its ability to produce nectar in abundance, making it an important resource for nocturnal pollinators."
