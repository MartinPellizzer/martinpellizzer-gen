    "intro": "Eucalyptus exigua, commonly known as the small-leaved malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers, which are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in mallee and dry woodland habitats. Eucalyptus exigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
