    "intro": "Ebelingia paucijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ebelingia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate and alpine climates. The plant features slender, branched stems and lanceolate leaves with a distinctively narrowed base. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like shapes, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
