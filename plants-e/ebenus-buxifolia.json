    "intro": "Ebenus buxifolia, commonly known as the box-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its small, evergreen leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Ebenus buxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
