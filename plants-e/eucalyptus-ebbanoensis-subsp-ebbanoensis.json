    "intro": "Eucalyptus ebbanoensis subsp. ebbanoensis, commonly known as the Ebbanoensis mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that is often flaky or peeling, and its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and glossy. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and attract a variety of pollinators. It produces small, woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands."
