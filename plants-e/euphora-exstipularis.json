    "intro": "Euphora exstipularis, commonly known as the blistering euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. Euphora exstipularis is also notable for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
