    "intro": "Euphorbia lenewtonii, commonly known as the Lenewton's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
