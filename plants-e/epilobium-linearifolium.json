    "intro": "Epilobium linearifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds. Epilobium linearifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
