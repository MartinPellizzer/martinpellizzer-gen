    "intro": "Eurya japonica var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese eurya, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its dense foliage and ornamental appeal. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soil conditions."
