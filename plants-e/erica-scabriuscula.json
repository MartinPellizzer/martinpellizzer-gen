It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form with dense, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves. Its flowers, which are typically pink or white, bloom in spring and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Erica scabriuscula is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish."
