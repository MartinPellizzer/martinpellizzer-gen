It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its rapid growth rate makes it ideal for vertical gardening or as a hanging plant."
