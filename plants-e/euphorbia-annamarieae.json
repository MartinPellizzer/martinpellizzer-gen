    "intro": "Euphorbia annamarieae, commonly known as the Annamarie's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the spurge family. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscaped gardens."
