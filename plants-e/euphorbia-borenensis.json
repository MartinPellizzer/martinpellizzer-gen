It features a short, thick stem with numerous erect, spiny branches that bear small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native environment. Euphorbia borenensis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
