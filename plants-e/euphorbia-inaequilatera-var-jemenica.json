    "intro": "Euphorbia inaequilatera var. jemenica, commonly known as the Yemen euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by bracts. It is adapted to grow in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections."
