    "intro": "Eugenia rondonensis, commonly known as the Rondonia myrtle, is a small evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or purple in color, which are used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
