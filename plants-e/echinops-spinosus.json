    "intro": "Echinops spinosus, commonly known as the spiny globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a spiky globe, which are a striking feature of the plant. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops spinosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
