    "intro": "Erythrina sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran coral tree, is a tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its slender, often branching stems are covered in thorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
