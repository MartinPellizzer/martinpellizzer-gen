    "intro": "Ephedra aurea, commonly known as golden ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in small, spherical pods. Ephedra aurea is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
