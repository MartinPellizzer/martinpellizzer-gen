    "intro": "Elatostema nemorosum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear or small mouse-ear, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Elatostema nemorosum is often found in wet or semi-aquatic habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native regions."
