    "intro": "Eragrostis orthoclada, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. Eragrostis orthoclada is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
