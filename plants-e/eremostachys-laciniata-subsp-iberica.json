    "intro": "Eremostachys laciniata subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian toothbrush plant, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
