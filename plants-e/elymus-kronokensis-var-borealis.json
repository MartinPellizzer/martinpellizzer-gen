    "intro": "Elymus kronokensis var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. This plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic fauna."
