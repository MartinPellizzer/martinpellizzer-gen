    "intro": "Euchaetis diosmoides, commonly known as the yellow ironwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The wood of Euchaetis diosmoides is dense and strong, making it valuable for construction and traditional uses."
