    "intro": "Eulalia lanipes, commonly known as the hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Eulalia lanipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in grassland ecosystems."
