    "intro": "Euphorbia inarticulata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among many euphorbias. The species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
