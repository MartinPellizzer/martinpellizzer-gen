    "intro": "Ericoides peltatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky habitats. It is relatively low-growing, with a mat-like form that helps it survive in harsh environmental conditions. Ericoides peltatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
