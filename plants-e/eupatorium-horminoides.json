    "intro": "Eupatorium horminoides, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Eupatorium horminoides is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to support local wildlife."
