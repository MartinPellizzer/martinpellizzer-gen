It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its harsh environment, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. It produces a milky latex when damaged, which is a common trait among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
