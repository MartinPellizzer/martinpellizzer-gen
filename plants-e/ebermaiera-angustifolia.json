    "intro": "Ebermaiera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ebermaiera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters wide. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
