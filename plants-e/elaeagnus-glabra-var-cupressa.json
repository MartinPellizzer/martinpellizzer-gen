    "intro": "Elaeagnus glabra var. cupressa, commonly known as silverberry or sandthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, branch-like stems that often appear almost tree-like, and its small, pale green leaves that turn golden in autumn. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, edible berries that are rich in nutrients. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a useful plant in landscaping and restoration projects."
