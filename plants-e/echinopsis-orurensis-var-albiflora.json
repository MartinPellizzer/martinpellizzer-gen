It is characterized by its spherical or cylindrical stems covered in white spines, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright sunlight, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in arid landscapes."
