    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca subsp. ericifolium, commonly known as the Ericifolium Buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountain meadows. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
