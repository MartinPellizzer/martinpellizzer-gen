    "intro": "Ecbolium ventricosum, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its inflated, pod-like fruits that resemble bladders, hence its common name. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along roadsides. Ecbolium ventricosum is often considered a weed but plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small insects."
