    "intro": "Eucalyptus canescens, commonly known as the silver-leafed eucalyptus, is a medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of white hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
