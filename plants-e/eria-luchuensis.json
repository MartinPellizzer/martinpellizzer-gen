    "intro": "Eria luchuensis, commonly known as the Luchuan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the islands of the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria luchuensis is considered a conservation concern."
