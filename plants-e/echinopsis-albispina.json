    "intro": "Echinopsis albispina, commonly known as the white-spined cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and white spines that give it its common name. The plant produces large, showy white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
