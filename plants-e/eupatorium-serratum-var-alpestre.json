    "intro": "Eupatorium serratum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine boneset, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
