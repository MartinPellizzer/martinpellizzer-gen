    "intro": "Echinopsis pachanoi, commonly known as the sacred cactus or Jesus Christ cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that bear clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its striking appearance and cultural significance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
