    "intro": "Eugenia lepidota, commonly known as the velvetleaf eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Eugenia lepidota is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic qualities."
