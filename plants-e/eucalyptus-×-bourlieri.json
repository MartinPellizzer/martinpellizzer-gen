    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 bourlieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and resistance to certain pests. This species is often used in revegetation projects due to its ecological benefits and hardiness."
