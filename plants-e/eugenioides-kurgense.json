    "intro": "Eugenioides kurgense, commonly known as the Kurgan eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature, often attracting birds and small mammals. Eugenioides kurgense is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
