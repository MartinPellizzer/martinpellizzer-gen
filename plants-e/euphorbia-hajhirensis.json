    "intro": "Euphorbia hajhirensis, commonly known as the Hajir Euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia hajhirensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
