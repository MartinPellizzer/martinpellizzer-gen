It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often densely clustered, with small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis ussuriensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
