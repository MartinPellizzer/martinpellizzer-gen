    "intro": "Eucalyptus crebra var. citrata, commonly known as lemon myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Due to its unique chemical composition, it is widely used in aromatherapy, culinary applications, and traditional medicine."
