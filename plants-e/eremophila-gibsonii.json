    "intro": "Eremophila gibsonii, commonly known as Gibson's bushfire wattle, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the winter months, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Eremophila gibsonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
