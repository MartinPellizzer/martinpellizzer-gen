    "intro": "Ehrharta tasmanica var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its ecological importance, it is often found in native grasslands and is valued for its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
