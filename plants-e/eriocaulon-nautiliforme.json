    "intro": "Eriocaulon nautiliforme, commonly known as the nautiliform sea grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is typically found in coastal wetlands and brackish water environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets. It plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Due to its preference for saline conditions, it is an indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
