    "intro": "Epilobium hirtum, commonly known as hairy willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wet meadows. The plant features erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. It produces showy pink or red flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread effectively in suitable environments."
