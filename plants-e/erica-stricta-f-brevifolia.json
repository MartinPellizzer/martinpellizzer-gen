    "intro": "Erica stricta f. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are dense and form a low, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
