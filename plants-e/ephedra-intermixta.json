    "intro": "Ephedra intermixta, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of China. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Ephedra intermixta is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its stimulant properties."
