    "intro": "Evelyna gracilis, commonly known as the slender moonflower, is a delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and heart-shaped, glossy green leaves. The plant produces pale lavender flowers that bloom at night, releasing a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Evelyna gracilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a popular choice for indoor gardening."
