    "intro": "Eriodictyon sessilifolium, commonly known as California's yerba santa, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid and Mediterranean climates, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The leaves contain essential oils and have been used traditionally by Native American communities for their medicinal properties."
