    "intro": "Elaphoglossum longifolium var. pastazensis, commonly known as the Pastaza holly fern, is a variant of the long-leaved holly fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. This variant is notable for its distinctive morphology and is native to the Andean region of South America."
