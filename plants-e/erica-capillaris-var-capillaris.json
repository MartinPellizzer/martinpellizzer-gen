It features dense, compact foliage with fine, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
