It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant has a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the rainy season. Eulophia pelorica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
