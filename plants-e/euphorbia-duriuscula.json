    "intro": "Euphorbia duriuscula, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia duriuscula is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
