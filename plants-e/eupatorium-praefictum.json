    "intro": "Eupatorium praefictum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and wetlands. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant also serves as a nectar source for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
