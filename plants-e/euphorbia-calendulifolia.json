    "intro": "Euphorbia calendulifolia, commonly known as the yellow spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, green stems and striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long-lasting blooms."
