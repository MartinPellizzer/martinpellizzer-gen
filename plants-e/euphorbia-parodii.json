    "intro": "Euphorbia parodii, commonly known as the giant spurge or Parodi's spurge, is a striking plant native to Argentina. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces unique, yellow-orange cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for arid and semi-arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, care must be taken when handling this plant to avoid skin irritation."
