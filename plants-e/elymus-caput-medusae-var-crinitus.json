    "intro": "Elymus caput-medusae var. crinitus, commonly known as the silky goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, silky, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are often adorned with soft, feathery bristles. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
