It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
