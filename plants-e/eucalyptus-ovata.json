    "intro": "Eucalyptus ovata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallet, is a medium to tall tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white powdery bloom, giving them a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale pink, which attract various pollinators. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, fibrous strips, and it is known for its aromatic oils, which have medicinal and commercial uses. Eucalyptus ovata is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and ecologically important species."
