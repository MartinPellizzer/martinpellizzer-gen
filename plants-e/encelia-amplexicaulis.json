    "intro": "Encelia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the coast chia or coastal chia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often clasping around the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray. Encelia amplexicaulis is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
