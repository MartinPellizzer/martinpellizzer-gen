    "intro": "Echinops spinosissimus subsp. bithynicus, commonly known as the Bithynian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Turkey and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads of purple-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a robust taproot system and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust spines and slightly smaller flower heads compared to other Echinops species."
