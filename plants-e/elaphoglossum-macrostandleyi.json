    "intro": "Elaphoglossum macrostandleyi, commonly known as the large-standley fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish scales. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Elaphoglossum macrostandleyi plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
