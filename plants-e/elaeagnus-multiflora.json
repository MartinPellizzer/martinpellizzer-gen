    "intro": "Elaeagnus multiflora, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges. Elaeagnus multiflora has a shallow root system that makes it adaptable to different environments."
