    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides f. villosa, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in dense, soft, white pubescence that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. This ornamental plant is valued for its unique texture and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
