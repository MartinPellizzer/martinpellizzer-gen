    "intro": "Euphorbia pubentissima, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and it produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and rocky areas. It is adapted to withstand drought and has a low-growing, mat-forming habit. Euphorbia pubentissima is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
