    "intro": "Epipactis hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a single, showy greenish-white flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy texture, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epipactis hispanica is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a notable species in ecological studies."
