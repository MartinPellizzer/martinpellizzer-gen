    "intro": "Euphorbia melicae, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia melicae is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
