It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by distinctive, leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. Euphorbia terracina var. retusa is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
