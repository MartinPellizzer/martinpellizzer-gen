    "intro": "Encephalartos pauli-guilielmi, commonly known as the Pauli-Guilielmi cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem with a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically a deep green color. Its cones are small and inconspicuous, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
