    "intro": "Euphorbia aspera var. oligadenia, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a unique, cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
