    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 sergijevskianum, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a distinct, segmented stem that resembles a bamboo cane. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, typical of its ancient evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
