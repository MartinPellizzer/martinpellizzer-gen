    "intro": "Euphorbia tresmariae, commonly known as the Cape Verde euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Cape Verde Islands. It features a branched stem with smooth, grayish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Euphorbia tresmariae is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
