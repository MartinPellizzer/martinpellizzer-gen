    "intro": "Euphorbia fulva, commonly known as the yellow-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia fulva is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
