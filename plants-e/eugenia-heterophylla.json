    "intro": "Eugenia heterophylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from elliptic to ovate and often covered in small, rough hairs. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow or red when mature. Eugenia heterophylla is often found in coastal and wet tropical forests, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils."
