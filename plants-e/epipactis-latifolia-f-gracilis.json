    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender marsh helleborine, is a variant of the marsh helleborine, a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are spurred at the base and have a distinct, complex structure typical of orchids. This form is distinguished by its more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Epipactis latifolia."
