    "intro": "Euphorbia xalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It contains a milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia xalapensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
