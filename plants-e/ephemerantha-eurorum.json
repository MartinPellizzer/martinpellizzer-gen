    "intro": "Ephemerantha eurorum, commonly known as the European ephemeral, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom briefly during the warmer months. Ephemerantha eurorum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its short flowering period, it is considered a rare and elusive species in its native habitat."
