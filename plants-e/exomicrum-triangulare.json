    "intro": "Exomicrum triangulare, commonly known as the triangular moss, is a small, cryptogamic plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a compact structure with short, branching stems and leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a distinct, triangular shape, giving the species its scientific name. Exomicrum triangulare plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
