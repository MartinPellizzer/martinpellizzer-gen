    "intro": "Eriocaulon bisumbellatum, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
