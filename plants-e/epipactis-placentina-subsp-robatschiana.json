    "intro": "Epipactis placentina subsp. robatschiana, commonly known as the Robatschian marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, linear leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent lip petals. This subspecies is typically found in wet meadows and marshy habitats across Central and Eastern Europe. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with calcareous substrates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
