It features small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
