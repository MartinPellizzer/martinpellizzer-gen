    "intro": "Erica nana, commonly known as dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in early spring. Erica nana thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
