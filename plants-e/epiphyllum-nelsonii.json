    "intro": "Epiphyllum nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's night bloomer, is a striking cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often segmented and covered in soft spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Epiphyllum nelsonii thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
