    "intro": "Eurycaulis camptocentrus, commonly known as the zigzag seagrass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal regions. It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its ribbon-like leaves that curve in a zigzag pattern. This plant thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in tidal zones. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats that stabilize sediment and provide habitat for marine life. Eurycaulis camptocentrus plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by reducing erosion and supporting biodiversity."
