    "intro": "Eugenia vacciniifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when ripe, and it is edible, though not widely consumed by humans."
