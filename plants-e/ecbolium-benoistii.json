    "intro": "Ecbolium benoistii, commonly known as the Benoist's ecbolium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, often with a slight reddish tinge. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ecbolium benoistii is considered a species of conservation concern."
