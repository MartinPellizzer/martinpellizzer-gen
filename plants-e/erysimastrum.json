    "intro": "Erysimastrum, commonly known as the prairie coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plants typically have hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and they thrive in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas. Erysimastrum species are often found in the central and western United States, where they play a role in supporting local pollinators. Their seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to their ability to colonize new areas."
