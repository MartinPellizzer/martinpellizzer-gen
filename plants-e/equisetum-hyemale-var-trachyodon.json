    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. trachyodon, commonly known as the rough horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in rough, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili at the top of its stems, which contain spores. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished from other equisetums by its more robust and coarsely textured stems."
