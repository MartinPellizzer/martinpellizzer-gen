    "intro": "Elymus pendulinus subsp. brachypodioides, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often arching stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
