It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
