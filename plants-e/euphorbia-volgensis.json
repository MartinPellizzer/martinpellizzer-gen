    "intro": "Euphorbia volgensis, commonly known as the Volgensis spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia volgensis is adapted to withstand drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
