    "intro": "Echeveria procera, commonly known as the Tree Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a compact, tree-like structure. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of vibrant purple or pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its compact form. Echeveria procera is popular in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance."
