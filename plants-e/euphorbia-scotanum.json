    "intro": "Euphorbia scotanum, commonly known as the Scottish spurge, is a perennial herb native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Euphorbia scotanum is known for its latex-like sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
