    "intro": "Erlangea sengensis, commonly known as the Sengeni bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
