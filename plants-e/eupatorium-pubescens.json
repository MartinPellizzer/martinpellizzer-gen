    "intro": "Eupatorium pubescens, commonly known as rough eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, fertile soils. Its showy, white to pale blue flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eupatorium pubescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
