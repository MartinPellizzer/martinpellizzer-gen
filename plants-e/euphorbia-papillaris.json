    "intro": "Euphorbia papillaris, commonly known as the nipple cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, globular shape with a spiny, segmented stem that resembles a cluster of nipples, giving it its common name. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It produces yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia papillaris is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
