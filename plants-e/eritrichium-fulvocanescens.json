    "intro": "Eritrichium fulvocanescens, commonly known as the yellow sandstem, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss. Eritrichium fulvocanescens is a low-growing perennial that produces bright yellow flowers in early spring."
