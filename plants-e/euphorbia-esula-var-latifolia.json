    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. latifolia, commonly known as leafy spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, waxy, and often bluish-gray leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by specialized leaves. It is considered an invasive species in North America, particularly in the western United States, where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it difficult to control."
