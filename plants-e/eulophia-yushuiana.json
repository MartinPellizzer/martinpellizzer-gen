    "intro": "Eulophia yushuiana, commonly known as the Yushu orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces striking, dark purple to violet flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a short, branched stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is of significant interest for conservation efforts."
