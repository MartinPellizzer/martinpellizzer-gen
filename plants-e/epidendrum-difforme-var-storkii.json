    "intro": "Epidendrum difforme var. storkii, commonly known as the Stork's Bill Epidendrum, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant color and unique floral structure."
