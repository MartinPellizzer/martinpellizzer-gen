    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stained helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking, showy flowers that range in color from green to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. It produces a single, erect spike of flowers, often with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. This orchid is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
