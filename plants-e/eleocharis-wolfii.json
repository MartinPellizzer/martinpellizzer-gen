    "intro": "Eleocharis wolfii, commonly known as the wolf's bulrush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of cylindrical, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within wetland habitats. Eleocharis wolfii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
