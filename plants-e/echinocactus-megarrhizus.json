    "intro": "Echinocactus megarrhizus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical shape, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, apple-like fruits. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Echinocactus megarrhizus is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
