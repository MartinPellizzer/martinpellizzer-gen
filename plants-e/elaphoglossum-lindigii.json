    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lindigii, commonly known as Lindig's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often recurved fronds that resemble the shape of a harts-tongue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum lindigii is native to regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil and Peru."
