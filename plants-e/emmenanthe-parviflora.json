    "intro": "Emmenanthe parviflora, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a striking plant native to the wet tropical forests of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as moths and bees. Emmenanthe parviflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish."
