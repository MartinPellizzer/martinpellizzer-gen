    "intro": "Eriogonum compositum, commonly known as the composite buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eriogonum compositum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
