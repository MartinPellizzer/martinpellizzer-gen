    "intro": "Echinopsis tulhuayacensis, commonly known as the Huayacari cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of central and southern Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its adaptations include a shallow root system and the ability to store water in its stem for survival in drought conditions. Echinopsis tulhuayacensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
