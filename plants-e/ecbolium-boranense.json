    "intro": "Ecbolium boranense, commonly known as the Boranese sandveld candelabra, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, multi-branched structure and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Ecbolium boranense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
