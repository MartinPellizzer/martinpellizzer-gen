    "intro": "Equisetum timorianum, commonly known as the Timor horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It lacks true leaves and instead has sterile and fertile stems that produce spores. Equisetum timorianum is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
