    "intro": "Euploca torreyi, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking white to pale purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Euploca torreyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
