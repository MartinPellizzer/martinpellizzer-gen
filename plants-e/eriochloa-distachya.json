    "intro": "Eriochloa distachya, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, two-branched inflorescences that are often mistaken for true bromes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Eriochloa distachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
