    "intro": "Edritria sylvatica, commonly known as the forest violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in shaded forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in early spring. Edritria sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of woodland ecosystems."
