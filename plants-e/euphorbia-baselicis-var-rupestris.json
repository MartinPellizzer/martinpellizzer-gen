    "intro": "Euphorbia baselicis var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The leaves are typically small, rounded, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
