    "intro": "Echinospermum kotschyi, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Echinospermum kotschyi is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
