    "intro": "Eremophila divaricata subsp. divaricata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Emu Bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces spikes of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native gardens."
