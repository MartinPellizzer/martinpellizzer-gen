    "intro": "Euphorbia hypogaea, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces a milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia hypogaea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
