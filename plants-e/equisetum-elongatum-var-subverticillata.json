    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. subverticillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horse tail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its subverticillate arrangement of branches, giving it a unique appearance compared to other equisetum species."
