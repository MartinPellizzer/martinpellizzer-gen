    "intro": "Ervum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Ervum stenophyllum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
