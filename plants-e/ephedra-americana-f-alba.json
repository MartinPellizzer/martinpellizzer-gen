    "intro": "Ephedra americana f. alba, commonly known as white ephedra, is a dioecious plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in cone-like structures, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert regions. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has been the subject of both scientific study and regulatory scrutiny."
