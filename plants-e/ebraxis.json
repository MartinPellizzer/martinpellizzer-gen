    "intro": "Ebraxis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are adapted to conserve water, featuring a thick, waxy cuticle and reduced surface area. Due to its unique characteristics and limited habitat, Ebraxis is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
