    "intro": "Exellodendron gracile, commonly known as the slender exellodendron, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to moist, well-drained soils in shaded environments."
