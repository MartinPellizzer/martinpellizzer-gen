    "intro": "Euphorbia polycarpa var. appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments and stores water in its stems for survival during droughts. The sap of this plant contains latex, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
