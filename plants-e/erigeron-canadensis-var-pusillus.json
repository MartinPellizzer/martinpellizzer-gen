    "intro": "Erigeron canadensis var. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It features slender, branching stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small blue to purple flowers. This variety is smaller than the typical E. canadensis, with a more compact growth form."
