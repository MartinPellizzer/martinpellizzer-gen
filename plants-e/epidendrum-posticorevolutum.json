    "intro": "Epidendrum posticorevolutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
