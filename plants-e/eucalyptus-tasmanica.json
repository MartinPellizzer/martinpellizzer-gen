    "intro": "Eucalyptus tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian gum or white gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin layers, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus tasmanica is adapted to coastal and wetland environments, and it plays an important role in the local ecosystem. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
