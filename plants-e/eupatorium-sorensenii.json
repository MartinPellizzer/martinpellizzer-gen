    "intro": "Eupatorium sorensenii, commonly known as Sorensen's boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States.

The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dark green, serrated leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in wetlands and stream banks. Its name derives from the stiff, jointed appearance of its stems, which resemble bones."
