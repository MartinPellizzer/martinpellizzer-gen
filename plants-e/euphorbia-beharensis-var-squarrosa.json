    "intro": "Euphorbia beharensis var. squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
