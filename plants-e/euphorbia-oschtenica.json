    "intro": "Euphorbia oschtenica, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, which is a swollen stem base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. Its leaves are typically fleshy and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia oschtenica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
