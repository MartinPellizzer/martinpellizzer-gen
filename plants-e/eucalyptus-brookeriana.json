    "intro": "Eucalyptus brookeriana, commonly known as the mountain eucalyptus, is a tall, slender tree native to the high-altitude regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually narrow and slightly hairy. The tree produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale blue, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties. This hardy species is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in subalpine and alpine environments."
