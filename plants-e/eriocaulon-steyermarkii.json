    "intro": "Eriocaulon steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's bulbous rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its clustered, bulbous base and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates. Eriocaulon steyermarkii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
