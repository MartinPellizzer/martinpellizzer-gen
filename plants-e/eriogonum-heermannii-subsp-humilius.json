    "intro": "Eriogonum heermannii subsp. humilius, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum heermannii subsp. humilius plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
