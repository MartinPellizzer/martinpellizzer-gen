    "intro": "[WRONG START] Embilia scortechinii, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often gland-dotted and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine for their antioxidant properties. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and valuable in herbal remedies."
