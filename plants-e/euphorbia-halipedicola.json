    "intro": "Euphorbia halipedicola, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
