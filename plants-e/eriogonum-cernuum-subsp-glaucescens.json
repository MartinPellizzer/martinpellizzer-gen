    "intro": "Eriogonum cernuum subsp. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with gray-green foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive bluish-gray appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments."
