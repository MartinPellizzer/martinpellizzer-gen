    "intro": "Eupatorium thyrsiflorum var. holoclerum, commonly known as the Florida ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and pine flatwoods."
