    "intro": "Erophila vulgaris, commonly known as common watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its feathery, submerged leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that can dominate aquatic ecosystems. Erophila vulgaris is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
