It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its ecological significance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
