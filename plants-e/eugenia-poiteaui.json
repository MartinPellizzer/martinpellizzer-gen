    "intro": "Eugenia poiteaui, commonly known as the Pichincha guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a unique flavor. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
