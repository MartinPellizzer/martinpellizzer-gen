    "intro": "Eriogonum dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eriogonum dichotomum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
