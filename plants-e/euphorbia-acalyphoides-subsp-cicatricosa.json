    "intro": "Euphorbia acalyphoides subsp. cicatricosa, commonly known as the scarred euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is relatively low-maintenance when cultivated."
