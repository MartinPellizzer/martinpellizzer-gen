    "intro": "Euphorbia dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, fleshy leaves that help store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
