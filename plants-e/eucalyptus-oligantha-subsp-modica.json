    "intro": "Eucalyptus oligantha subsp. modica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, aromatic flowers that typically bloom in winter. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance through its deep root system. Its bark is often flaky and greyish, and it produces woody capsules that contain small, dark seeds. This subspecies is of interest for its ecological role and potential uses in horticulture and land rehabilitation."
