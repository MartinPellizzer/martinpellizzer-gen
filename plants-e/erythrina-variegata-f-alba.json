    "intro": "Erythrina variegata f. alba, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, contrasting sharply with the bright red flowers of the typical variety, making it a popular ornamental species. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to produce bright red, flame-like seed pods that add visual interest throughout the year."
