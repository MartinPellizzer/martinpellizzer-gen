    "intro": "Eucalyptus hendrsonii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which appear during the winter months. Its aromatic oils, primarily found in the leaves, contribute to its medicinal and aromatic uses. Eucalyptus hendrsonii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
