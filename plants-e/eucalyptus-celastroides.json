It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to white bark, which peels off in thin, fibrous strips. The plant produces small, creamy-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming between September and November. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight blue-green hue. Eucalyptus celastroides is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
