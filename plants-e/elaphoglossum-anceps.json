    "intro": "Elaphoglossum anceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, glossy dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Elaphoglossum anceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
