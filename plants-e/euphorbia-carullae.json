    "intro": "Euphorbia carullae, commonly known as the Socotra candelabra, is a unique succulent native to the Socotra archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, resembling a candlestick, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
