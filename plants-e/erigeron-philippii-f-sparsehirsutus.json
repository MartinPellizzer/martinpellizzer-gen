    "intro": "Erigeron philippii f. sparsehirsutus, commonly known as the sparse-hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in a composite head, with both ray and disk florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced hair coverage compared to the typical form, giving it a more delicate appearance."
