    "intro": "Eriocaulon curvifolium, commonly known as the curlyleaf spike-rush, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively in shallow water. Eriocaulon curvifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
