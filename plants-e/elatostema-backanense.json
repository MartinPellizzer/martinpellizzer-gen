    "intro": "Elatostema backanense, commonly known as the backan sandwort, is a small herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers. Its botanical structure is characterized by a short, underground stem and a lack of true leaves, with the photosynthetic function carried out by the leaf-like structures. Elatostema backanense is part of the family Bryophyta, though it is actually a member of the Caryophyllaceae family."
