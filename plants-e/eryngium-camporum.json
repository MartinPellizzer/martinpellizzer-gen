    "intro": "Eryngium camporum, commonly known as field thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and along roadsides. Eryngium camporum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
