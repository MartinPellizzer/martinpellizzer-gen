    "intro": "Eugenia cyanophylla, commonly known as the blue-leaf eucalyptus, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin layers, a feature common among many eucalyptus species. Eugenia cyanophylla is often found in shaded, moist environments and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
