    "intro": "Eugenia gaudichaudiana, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, segmented fruits. The fruit's pericarp is divided into segments, each containing a single seed, and it is prized for its sweet, aromatic pulp. Eugenia gaudichaudiana thrives in humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests."
