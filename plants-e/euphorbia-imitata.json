    "intro": "Euphorbia imitata, commonly known as the mimic euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
