    "intro": "Erigeron eatonii subsp. typicus, commonly known as the Eaton's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its daisy-like appearance, with white ray florets surrounding a yellow disk floret. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
