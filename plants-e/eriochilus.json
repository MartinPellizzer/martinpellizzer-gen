    "intro": "Eriochilus, commonly known as the mountain daisies, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Eriochilus species typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in alpine or subalpine regions. They have small, narrow leaves and produce flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Many species within this genus are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
