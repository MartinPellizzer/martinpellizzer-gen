    "intro": "Erythronium umbilicatum subsp. monostolum, commonly known as the eastern trout lily, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features a distinctive yellow flower with a darker throat, often surrounded by three to six broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded habitats, such as deciduous forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually mottled with green and white patterns, and the flowers bloom in early spring. The subspecies monostolum is distinguished by its single, upright flower stalk, setting it apart from other subspecies of Erythronium."
