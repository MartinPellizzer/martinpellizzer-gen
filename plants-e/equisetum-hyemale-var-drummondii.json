    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. This variety is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and its ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
