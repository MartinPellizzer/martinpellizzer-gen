    "intro": "Eritrichium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth hoary vetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that become glabrous as they mature, giving it its common name. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and disturbed areas. Eritrichium glabratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
