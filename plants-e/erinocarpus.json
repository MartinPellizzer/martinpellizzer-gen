    "intro": "Erinocarpus, commonly known as the \"sicklepod\" or \"devil's backbone,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its unique, twisted seed pods that resemble a curved sickle or a spine, which give it its common names. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Erinocarpus species often have compound leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. The seeds are enclosed in the distinctive, hard, and sometimes spiny pods, which are adapted for dispersal by animals or wind."
