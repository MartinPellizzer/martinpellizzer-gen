    "intro": "Epidendrum flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible epidendrum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforest environments. The plant features long, arching stems covered with ovate, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or pale markings. Its flowers are showy, with a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red, and are typically arranged in racemes. Epidendrum flexuosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its adaptability to various growing conditions."
