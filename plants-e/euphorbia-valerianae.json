    "intro": "Euphorbia valerianae, commonly known as the Valerian spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically yellow or green, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem to survive drought conditions. Euphorbia valerianae is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
