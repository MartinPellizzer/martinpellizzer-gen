    "intro": "Eugenia rhizophora, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to tropical coastal regions. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that extend into the water, providing structural support in the soft, muddy substrates of mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, fleshy berries. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. Eugenia rhizophora plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial wildlife."
