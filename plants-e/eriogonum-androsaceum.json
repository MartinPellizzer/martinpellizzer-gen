    "intro": "Eriogonum androsaceum, commonly known as the Androsace phlox, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky habitats or open woodlands. Eriogonum androsaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
