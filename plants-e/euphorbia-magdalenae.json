    "intro": "Euphorbia magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalen's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive appearance with a short, thick stem and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a unique structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stem to survive dry conditions. Euphorbia magdalenae is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
