    "intro": "Erica multumbraculata, commonly known as the shadow heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high sunlight exposure. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are dense and provide a compact, bushy appearance. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late summer, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Erica multumbraculata is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
