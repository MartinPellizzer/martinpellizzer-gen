    "intro": "Espeletia corymbosa var. foliosa, commonly known as the \"white tree of the Andes,\" is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and a tall, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing insulation against the cold and harsh conditions of its environment. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in white or pale purple hues. This species is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems."
