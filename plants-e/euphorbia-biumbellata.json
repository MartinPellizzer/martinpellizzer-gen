    "intro": "Euphorbia biumbellata, commonly known as the two-armed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems that often form a shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia biumbellata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
