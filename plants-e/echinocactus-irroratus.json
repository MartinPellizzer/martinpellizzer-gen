    "intro": "Echinocactus irroratus, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a spineless cactus characterized by its globular shape and vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically borne on a tall, central stem and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Echinocactus irroratus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
