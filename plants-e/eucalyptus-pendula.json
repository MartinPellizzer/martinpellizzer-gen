    "intro": "Eucalyptus pendula, commonly known as the weeping gum, is a striking tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree produces smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. Eucalyptus pendula flowers in spring, producing clusters of small, white or pale pink blossoms that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
