    "intro": "Echinocactus islayensis, commonly known as the Islay cactus, is a species of cactus native to the rocky soils of the Baja California peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide shade and reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
