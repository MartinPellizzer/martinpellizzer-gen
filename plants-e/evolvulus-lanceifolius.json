    "intro": "Evolvulus lanceifolius, commonly known as the lanceleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is an annual or perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. The flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, giving it its common name."
