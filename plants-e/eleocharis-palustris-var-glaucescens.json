    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris var. glaucescens, commonly known as the bluish spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often bear clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its bluish-green coloration, which gives it its common name."
