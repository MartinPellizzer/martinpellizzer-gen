    "intro": "Empetrum, commonly known as crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its small, dense clusters of dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is commonly found in northern regions, including Arctic and alpine environments. Empetrum has small, leathery leaves that are usually arranged in a compact, mat-like structure. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and small mammals, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
