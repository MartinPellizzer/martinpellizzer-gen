    "intro": "Eucephalus engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Engelmann's blueweed is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
