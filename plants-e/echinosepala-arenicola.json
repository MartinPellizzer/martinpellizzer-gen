    "intro": "Echinosepala arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the autumn. The plant has adapted to sandy soils and high salinity, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Echinosepala arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
