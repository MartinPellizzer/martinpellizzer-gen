    "intro": "Eupatorium regnellii, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it an important plant for ecological diversity. Eupatorium regnellii is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
