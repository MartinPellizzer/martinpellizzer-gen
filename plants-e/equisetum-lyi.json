    "intro": "Equisetum lyi, commonly known as the Mexican horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the order Equisetales. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing sporangia that release spores for reproduction. Equisetum lyi typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest surviving plant groups."
