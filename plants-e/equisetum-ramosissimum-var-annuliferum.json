    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum var. annuliferum, commonly known as the annulated horse tail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and a distinctive, segmented stem covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces fertile strobila (spore cones) at the top of the stem, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage and unique morphology make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
