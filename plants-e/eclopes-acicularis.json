    "intro": "Eclopes acicularis, commonly known as the needleleaf broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant has a slender, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for attachment to host roots. Its flowers are usually small and pale, often appearing in clusters, and it produces numerous tiny, dry fruits. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitats."
