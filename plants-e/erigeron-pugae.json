    "intro": "Erigeron pugae, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its silver-gray foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Erigeron pugae produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months."
