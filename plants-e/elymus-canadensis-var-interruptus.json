    "intro": "Elymus canadensis var. interruptus, commonly known as Canada wild rye, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in wetland restoration. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
