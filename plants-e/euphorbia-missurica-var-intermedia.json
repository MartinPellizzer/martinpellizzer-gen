It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and alternate, simple leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
