    "intro": "Elymus glaucus subsp. virescens, commonly known as the green wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hair. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
