    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 timpeana, commonly known as the Timpe's helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically have a greenish-yellow hue with purple or brown markings. The plant is perennial and grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil. Epipactis \u00d7 timpeana is primarily pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
