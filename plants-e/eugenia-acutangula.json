It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white or pink flowers. It produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. Eugenia acutangula is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
