    "intro": "Epidendrum fruticulus, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf epidendrum, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum fruticulus is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
