    "intro": "Epidorkis pellucida, commonly known as the glassy moss, is a species of liverwort characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant's leaves are thin and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It reproduces via spores, which are released from capsules that form on the stems. Epidorkis pellucida is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
