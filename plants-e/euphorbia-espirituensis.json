    "intro": "Euphorbia espirituensis, commonly known as the Espiritu Santo euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the island of Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
