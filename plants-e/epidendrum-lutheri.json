    "intro": "Epidendrum lutheri, commonly known as the Luther's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a thick, leathery outer layer. Epidendrum lutheri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
