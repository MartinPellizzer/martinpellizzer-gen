    "intro": "Eleutherococcus simonii, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. Eleutherococcus simonii is valued for its adaptogenic properties and is used in traditional medicine."
