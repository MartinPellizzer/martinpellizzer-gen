    "intro": "Erica media, commonly known as the common heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or grayish layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica media thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
