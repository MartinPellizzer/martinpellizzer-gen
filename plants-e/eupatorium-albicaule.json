    "intro": "Eupatorium albicaule, commonly known as white stalk eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called umbels. These flowers bloom in the summer months and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eupatorium albicaule is typically found in moist, open habitats like woodland edges and wetlands."
