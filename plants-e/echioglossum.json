    "intro": "Echioglossum, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species that are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture. Echioglossum species produce umbellate or cymose inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers. These plants are generally herbaceous and can be found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
