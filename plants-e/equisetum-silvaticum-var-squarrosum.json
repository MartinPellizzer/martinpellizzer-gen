    "intro": "Equisetum silvaticum var. squarrosum, commonly known as the rough field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. This variety is distinguished by its rough, scaly texture compared to other horsetail species."
