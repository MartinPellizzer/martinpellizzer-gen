    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. prostratum, commonly known as the swamp horsetail, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that thrives in wetland environments. It features whorled, needle-like leaves that are typically green and slightly rough to the touch. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. It has a long evolutionary history and is one of the few surviving members of the ancient order Equisetales. This variety is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, spreading along the ground to form dense mats."
