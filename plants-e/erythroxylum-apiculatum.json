    "intro": "Erythroxylum apiculatum, commonly known as the Andean coca, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a pubescent underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids, particularly cocaine. However, it also has traditional uses in local cultures for medicinal and ritualistic purposes."
