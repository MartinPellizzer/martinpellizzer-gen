    "intro": "Eugenia megaflora, commonly known as the giant wax apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that give way to round, fleshy berries with a waxy coating. These berries are edible, though typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans. Eugenia megaflora plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native animals."
