    "intro": "Elaphoglossum costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum costaricense plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
