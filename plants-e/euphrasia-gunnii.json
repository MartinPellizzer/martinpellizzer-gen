It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it thrive in its alpine habitat. Euphrasia gunnii is often found in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. Its name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine for its purported eye health benefits."
