It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, spherical berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas.
