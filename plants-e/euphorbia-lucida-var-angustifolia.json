    "intro": "Euphorbia lucida var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, woody stem with upright, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to store water in its thick leaves."
