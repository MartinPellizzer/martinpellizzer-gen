It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces fertile strobila at the top of the stem, which contains spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its unique appearance and ancient lineage make it a distinctive and interesting botanical specimen."
