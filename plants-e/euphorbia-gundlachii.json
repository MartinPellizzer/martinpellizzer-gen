    "intro": "Euphorbia gundlachii, commonly known as the Sonoran desert euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its production of a milky sap known as latex. The plant typically grows as a low, cushion-like shrub with thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is a defining feature of the genus Euphorbia. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient member of the desert flora."
