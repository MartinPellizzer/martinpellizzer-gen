    "intro": "Eurybia glomerata, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads that are surrounded by white, papery bracts. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in saline environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eurybia glomerata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
