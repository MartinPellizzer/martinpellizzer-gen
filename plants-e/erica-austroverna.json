    "intro": "Erica austroverna, commonly known as the Southern Heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is well adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Erica austroverna is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
