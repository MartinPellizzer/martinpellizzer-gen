It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are pale blue to white in color. It plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations due to its nectar-rich blooms."
