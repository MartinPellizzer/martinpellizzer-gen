    "intro": "Eriogonum jamesii var. arcuatum, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats. Its adaptations include deep root systems and small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss."
