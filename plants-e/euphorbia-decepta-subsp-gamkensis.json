    "intro": "Euphorbia decepta subsp. gamkensis, commonly known as the Cape Town spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small yellow flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it should be handled with care as it contains toxic sap."
