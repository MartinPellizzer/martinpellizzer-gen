    "intro": "Epidendrum oblongialpicola, commonly known as the Andes orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for specialized orchid growers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
