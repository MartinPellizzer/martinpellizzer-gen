    "intro": "Eleocharis ovata var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, three-lobed flowers. This variety is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant's rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas quickly."
