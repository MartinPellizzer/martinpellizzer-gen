    "intro": "Erlangea schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's erlanga, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
