This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. It possesses a compact, leafy structure with elongated stems that support its delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant's roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and substrate, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Epidorkis caulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its ecosystem."
