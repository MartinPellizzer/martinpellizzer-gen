    "intro": "Eugenia stelechanthoides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant features small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forest growth. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
