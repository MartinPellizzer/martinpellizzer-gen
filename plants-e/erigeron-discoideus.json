    "intro": "Erigeron discoideus, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its blue to purple flower heads consist of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Erigeron discoideus is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
