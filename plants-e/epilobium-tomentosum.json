    "intro": "Epilobium tomentosum, commonly known as woolly willow or hairy willow, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Epilobium tomentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
