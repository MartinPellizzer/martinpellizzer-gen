    "intro": "Epilobium parviflorum f. brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
