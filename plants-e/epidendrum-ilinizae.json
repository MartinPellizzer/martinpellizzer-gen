    "intro": "Epidendrum ilinizae, commonly known as the Il\u00ednizae orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
