    "intro": "Erica demissa var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Erica demissa var. crassifolia is often used in coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained conditions."
