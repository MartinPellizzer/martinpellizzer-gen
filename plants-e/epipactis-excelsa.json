    "intro": "Epipactis excelsa, commonly known as the noble helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, pleated leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, forward-facing lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Epipactis excelsa is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
