    "intro": "Elaeocarpus ngii subsp. ngii, commonly known as the Bornean elaeocarp, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
