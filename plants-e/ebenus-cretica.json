    "intro": "Ebenus cretica, commonly known as the Cretan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Ebenus cretica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
