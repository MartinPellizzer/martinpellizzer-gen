    "intro": "Erica woodii subsp. platyura, commonly known as the flat-leaved heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the species. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
