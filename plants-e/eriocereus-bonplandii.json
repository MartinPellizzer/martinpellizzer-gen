    "intro": "Eriocereus bonplandii, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are cylindrical and often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in scrublands or dry forests."
