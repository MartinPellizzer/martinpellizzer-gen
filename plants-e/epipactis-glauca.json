    "intro": "Epipactis glauca, commonly known as the blue helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a striking blue-violet flower spike that bears numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids. It has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Epipactis glauca is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
