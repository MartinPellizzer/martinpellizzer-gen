    "intro": "Elymus pungens subsp. fontqueri, commonly known as the desert wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically pale green to reddish-brown in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rocky soils and in desert scrub habitats. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
