    "intro": "Endiandra elaeocarpa, commonly known as the red sanders, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The tree is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. It typically grows in lowland and hill forests, reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species, with conservation efforts underway to protect its remaining populations."
