    "intro": "Eritrichium microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf eritrichium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its seeds are small and enclosed in a hard, dry fruit, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Eritrichium microcarpum is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations."
