It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to produce clusters of small, waxy, white flowers. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is also noted for its resilience and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
