    "intro": "Eupatorium elaeagnifolium, commonly known as silverleaf eupatorium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in the southeastern region of the U.S. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through rhizomes, forming dense stands. Silverleaf eupatorium is sometimes considered a weed in wetland restoration projects due to its aggressive growth habit."
