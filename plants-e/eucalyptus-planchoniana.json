    "intro": "Eucalyptus planchoniana, commonly known as the mountain eucalyptus, is a species native to the high altitudes of southern South America. It is a tall, slender tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive blue-green color due to a dense covering of hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, clustered in umbels, and attract a variety of pollinators. This species is well adapted to cold and humid conditions, making it a characteristic plant of the Andean cloud forests."
