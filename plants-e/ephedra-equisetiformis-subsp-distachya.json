    "intro": "Ephedra equisetiformis subsp. distachya, commonly known as the slender ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its branched, woody stems that resemble those of the horsetail plant, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. This subspecies is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures."
