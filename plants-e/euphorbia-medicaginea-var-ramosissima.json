    "intro": "Euphorbia medicaginea var. ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
