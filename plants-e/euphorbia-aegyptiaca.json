    "intro": "Euphorbia aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky, toxic latex when damaged, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Euphorbia aegyptiaca is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
