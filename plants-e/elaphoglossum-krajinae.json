    "intro": "Elaphoglossum krajinae, commonly known as the Krajina holly fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters known as sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum krajinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
