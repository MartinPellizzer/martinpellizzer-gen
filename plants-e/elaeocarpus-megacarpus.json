It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces large, woody fruits that are typically orange to red in color. The flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and the plant is often found in moist, lowland forests. The fruit contains a single large seed surrounded by a fleshy, edible aril, which is an important food source for various wildlife species. It is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
