    "intro": "Elaeocarpus, commonly known as the satinwood or satin-leaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Elaeocarpaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Elaeocarpus species typically have simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and leathery in texture. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with showy petals that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains one or more seeds, and the wood of some species is highly valued for its fine grain and durability."
