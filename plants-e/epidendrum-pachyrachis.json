    "intro": "Epidendrum pachyrachis, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and striking, spider-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Epidendrum pachyrachis is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
