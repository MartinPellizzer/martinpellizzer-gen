    "intro": "Echium micranthum var. inclusum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fleabane, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant's structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to the challenging conditions of its native region."
