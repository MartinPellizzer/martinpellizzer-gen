    "intro": "Elaphoglossum acutum, commonly known as the acute holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually. Elaphoglossum acutum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
