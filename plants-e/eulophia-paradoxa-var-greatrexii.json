    "intro": "Eulophia paradoxa var. greatrexii, commonly known as the Greatrex's eulophia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a robust rhizome with dense, fleshy roots that help it thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with large, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements."
