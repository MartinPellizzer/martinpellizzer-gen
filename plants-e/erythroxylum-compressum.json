    "intro": "Erythroxylum compressum, commonly known as the compressed erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain seeds, and it is often found in moist, tropical environments. While it is not as well-known as other members of the Erythroxylum genus, it holds ecological significance in its native habitat."
