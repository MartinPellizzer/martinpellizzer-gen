    "intro": "Erica carnea subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western heath, is a dwarf shrub native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for coastal climates. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different flower morphology compared to the nominate form."
