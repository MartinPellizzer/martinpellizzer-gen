    "intro": "Ellipeia cherrevensis, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky crevices or among dense vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ellipeia cherrevensis is considered a vulnerable species."
