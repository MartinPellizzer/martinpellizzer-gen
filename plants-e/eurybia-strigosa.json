    "intro": "Eurybia strigosa, commonly known as hardy garden sedum, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Eurybia strigosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
