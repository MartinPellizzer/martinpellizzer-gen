    "intro": "Elaphoglossum martinezianum, commonly known as the Martinez's holly fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that often exhibit a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
