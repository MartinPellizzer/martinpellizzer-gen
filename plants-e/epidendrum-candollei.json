    "intro": "Epidendrum candollei, commonly known as the Candolle's orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. Its inflorescence is often branched, with numerous blooms that can last for several weeks. Epidendrum candollei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
