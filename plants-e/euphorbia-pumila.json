    "intro": "Euphorbia pumila, commonly known as the cushion spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of North America. It features dense, compact growth with small, thick leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance. Euphorbia pumila contains toxic sap, so care should be taken when handling it."
