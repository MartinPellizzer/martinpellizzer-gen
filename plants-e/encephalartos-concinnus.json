    "intro": "Encephalartos concinnus, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a compact, slow-growing cycad native to South Africa. It features a short, stout trunk with a crown of stiff, dark green, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, woody female cones that develop into bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
