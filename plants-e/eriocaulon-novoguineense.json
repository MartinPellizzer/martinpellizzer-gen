    "intro": "Eriocaulon novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea star sedge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
