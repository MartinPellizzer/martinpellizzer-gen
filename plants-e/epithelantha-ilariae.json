It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its rosette of thick, waxy leaves that store water, adapted to its desert environment. It produces a tall flowering stalk with small, blue-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of agave nectar."
