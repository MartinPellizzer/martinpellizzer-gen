    "intro": "Eurya japonica subsp. nitida, commonly known as Japanese holly or glossy holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is glossy and leathery, with small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for hedges, borders, or container gardening."
