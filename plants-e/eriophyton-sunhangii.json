    "intro": "Eriophyton sunhangii, commonly known as the Korean rock pine, is a rare and endangered gymnosperm native to South Korea. It is characterized by its unique, flattened, pine-like foliage and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops in mountainous regions. The plant has a very limited natural range, which makes it highly susceptible to habitat loss and environmental changes. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes. Due to its rarity, it is protected under various conservation laws in its native habitat."
