    "intro": "Echeandia molinae, commonly known as the Molina's cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the arid regions of northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered with small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low rainfall. Echeandia molinae is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
