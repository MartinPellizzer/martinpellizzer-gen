    "intro": "Echinocactus graessneri, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of bright yellow spines. The plant features a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in the summer months. Echinocactus graessneri is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
