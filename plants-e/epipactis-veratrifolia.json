It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers that often have a violet or purple tinge. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a complex root system and produces a single, erect stem with several flowers. Epipactis veratrifolia is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
