    "intro": "Erica cumuliflora, commonly known as the cloud heath or cloud heath Erica, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family. It is native to South Africa and typically grows in coastal areas with sandy soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erica cumuliflora is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
