    "intro": "Euonymus vulgaris, commonly known as the woodbine or burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its ornamental value is largely due to its vibrant autumn foliage, which turns a striking red or orange. Euonymus vulgaris is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
