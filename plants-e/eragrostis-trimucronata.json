    "intro": "Eragrostis trimucronata, commonly known as three-awn or black three-awn, is a grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted seed heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of three to five awns, which are bristle-like structures that give it its common name. Eragrostis trimucronata is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance."
