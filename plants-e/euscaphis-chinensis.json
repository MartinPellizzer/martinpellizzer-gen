    "intro": "Euscaphis chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its fruits are edible but often have a tart flavor, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine. Euscaphis chinensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
