    "intro": "Euphorbia poggei var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The leaves are typically small, oval, and also bear a similar fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces striking yellowish-green flower clusters, known as cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
