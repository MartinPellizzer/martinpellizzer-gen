    "intro": "Espeletia batata, commonly known as the batata espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant is known for its rosette-like growth habit, with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to high-altitude, arid environments. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Espeletia batata is often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, where it plays a role in local biodiversity and soil stabilization."
