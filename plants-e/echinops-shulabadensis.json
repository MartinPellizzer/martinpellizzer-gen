    "intro": "Echinops shulabadensis, commonly known as the Shulabad thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant produces spherical, spiny seed heads that are adapted to disperse seeds in dry, windy environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in harsh climates. Echinops shulabadensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
