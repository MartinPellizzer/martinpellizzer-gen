It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help it store water and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
