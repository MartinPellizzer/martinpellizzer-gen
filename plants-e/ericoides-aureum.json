    "intro": "Ericoides aureum, commonly known as the golden heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is typically found in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Ericoides aureum is well adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in heathlands or rocky areas. Its foliage consists of small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat."
