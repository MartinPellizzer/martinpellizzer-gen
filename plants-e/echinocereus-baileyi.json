    "intro": "Echinocereus baileyi, commonly known as the night-blooming hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its growth habit is typically solitary or in small clusters, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
