It is characterized by its lanceolate, glabrous leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by woolly bracts. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it suitable for arid environments. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
