    "intro": "Eutrema cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved ice plant, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Eutrema cordifolium is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion."
