    "intro": "Eriogonum ovalifolium var. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are oval-shaped and often have a rough texture, and the plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in mountainous regions. This variety is distinguished from other Eriogonum species by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits."
