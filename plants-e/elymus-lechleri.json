    "intro": "Elymus lechleri, commonly known as the Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Elymus lechleri is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, dry conditions with poor soil. It plays an important role in the ecosystems of the Andes, providing forage for livestock and habitat for various wildlife species."
