    "intro": "Echium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered bluemink, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echium parviflorum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sand dunes."
