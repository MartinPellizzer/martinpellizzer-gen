    "intro": "Erysimum amplexicaule, commonly known as the clustered wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its species name *amplexicaule*. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Erysimum amplexicaule is a hardy perennial that is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
