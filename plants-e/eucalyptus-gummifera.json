    "intro": "Eucalyptus gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or honey gum, is a tall, erect tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey to white bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus gummifera is known for its ability to exude a sticky resin, which has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for various purposes."
