    "intro": "Esula sylvatica, commonly known as the forest spire, is a flowering plant native to the temperate forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a dark green color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a common understory species in forest ecosystems. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
