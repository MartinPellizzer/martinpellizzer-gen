    "intro": "Eustephiopsis, commonly known as the goldenstar orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plants are characterized by their striking yellow flowers, which resemble stars, and their compact, evergreen foliage. Eustephiopsis species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, they are of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
