It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The tree produces small, round fruits with a thick, leathery outer layer and a sweet, aromatic pulp inside. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts. Elaeocarpus ornatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its timber."
