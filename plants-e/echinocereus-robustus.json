    "intro": "Echinocereus robustus, commonly known as the robust hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a rounded or cylindrical shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, spherical fruits. Echinocereus robustus is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
