    "intro": "Ephemerantha angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ephemeral, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a short growing season and rapid life cycle. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
