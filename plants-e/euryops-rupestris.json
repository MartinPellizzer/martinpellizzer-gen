    "intro": "Euryops rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Euryops rupestris is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
