It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The variety 'diffusa' is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of E. curviflora."
