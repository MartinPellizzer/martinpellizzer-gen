    "intro": "Eugenia cyanocarpa, commonly known as the blue-berried eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark blue berries. These berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
