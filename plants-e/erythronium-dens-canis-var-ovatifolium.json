    "intro": "Erythronium dens-canis var. ovatifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog's-tooth violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. The leaves are typically lanceolate and arranged in a rosette, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. This variety is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of E. dens-canis. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats."
