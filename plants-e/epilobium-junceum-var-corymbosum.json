    "intro": "Epilobium junceum var. corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered willow herb, is a flowering plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its corymbose inflorescence, which gives it its specific epithet."
