    "intro": "Eriocaulon indicum, commonly known as the Indian spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, often nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually short and narrow, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by specialized bracts. Eriocaulon indicum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
