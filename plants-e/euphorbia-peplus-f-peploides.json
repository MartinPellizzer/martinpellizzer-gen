    "intro": "Euphorbia peplus f. peploides, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers surrounded by a crown of bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Its succulent nature helps it retain moisture, making it drought-tolerant and adaptable to various environmental conditions."
