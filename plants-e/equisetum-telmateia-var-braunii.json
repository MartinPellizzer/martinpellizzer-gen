    "intro": "Equisetum telmateia var. braunii, commonly known as the dwarf scouring rush, is a variety of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its historical use as a natural scouring agent is due to the abrasive texture of its stems."
