    "intro": "Euphorbia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and distinctive floral structures called cyathia. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with lance-shaped, waxy leaves. Its yellowish-green cyathia are clustered in racemes, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Euphorbia racemosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
