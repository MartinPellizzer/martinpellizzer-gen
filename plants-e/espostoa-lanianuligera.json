    "intro": "Espostoa lanianuligera, commonly known as the silverleaf espostoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-blue foliage. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, violet flowers that bloom in the late spring. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
