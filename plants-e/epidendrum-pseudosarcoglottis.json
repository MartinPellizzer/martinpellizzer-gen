    "intro": "Epidendrum pseudosarcoglottis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often pendulous stems that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining substrates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions."
