    "intro": "Epidendrum trilobochilum, commonly known as the three-lobed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically features dark green, leathery leaves with a waxy texture, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Epidendrum trilobochilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
