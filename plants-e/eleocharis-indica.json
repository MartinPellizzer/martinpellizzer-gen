    "intro": "Eleocharis indica, commonly known as the rice sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or flooded soils, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of rice fields. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Eleocharis indica is also an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
