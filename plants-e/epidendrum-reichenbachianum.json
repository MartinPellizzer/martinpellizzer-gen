    "intro": "Epidendrum reichenbachianum, commonly known as the Pink Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in racemes, often with a contrasting green or yellow lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. This orchid is popular among growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
