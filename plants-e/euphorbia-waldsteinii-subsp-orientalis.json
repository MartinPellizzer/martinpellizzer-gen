    "intro": "Euphorbia waldsteinii subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Waldstein's spurge, is a succulent plant native to parts of Central Asia. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and striking foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
