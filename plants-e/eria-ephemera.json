    "intro": "Eria ephemera, commonly known as the fleeting orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, ephemeral blooms that appear briefly during the rainy season. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces fragrant, pale yellow to white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its short blooming period and limited distribution, Eria ephemera is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
