    "intro": "Elytrigia praetermissa, commonly known as the lesser wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Elytrigia praetermissa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
