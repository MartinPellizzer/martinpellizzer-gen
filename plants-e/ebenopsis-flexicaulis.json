    "intro": "Ebenopsis flexicaulis, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a woody, often twisted trunk and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in xeriscaping. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a valuable ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
