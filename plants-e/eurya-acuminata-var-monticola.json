    "intro": "Eurya acuminata var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain eurya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers, which are followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
