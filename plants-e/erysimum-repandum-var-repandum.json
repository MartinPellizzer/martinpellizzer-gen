    "intro": "Erysimum repandum var. repandum, commonly known as the winter flowering poppy, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its short life cycle and vibrant blooms make it a valuable addition to early season gardens."
