    "intro": "Echinops maracandicus, commonly known as the Persian thistle or goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are often mistaken for small cacti. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by the distinctive, spiky seed heads. Echinops maracandicus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
