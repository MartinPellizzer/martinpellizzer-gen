    "intro": "Eucalyptus altior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Eucalyptus altior is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat. Its wood is valued for its strength and is used in construction and furniture-making."
