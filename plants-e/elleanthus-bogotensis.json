    "intro": "Elleanthus bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It typically grows in wetland and marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
