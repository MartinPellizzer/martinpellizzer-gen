    "intro": "Euphoria longan var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed longan, is a variant of the longan tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard longan variety. The flowers are small, fragrant, and white, often appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a small, smooth, bluish-white drupe with a single seed. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and the sweet, edible fruit it produces."
