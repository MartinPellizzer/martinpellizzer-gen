    "intro": "Erimatalia rheedii, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is dioecious, meaning male and female plants are separate. Erimatalia rheedii is a slow-growing plant that thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
