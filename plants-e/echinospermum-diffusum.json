    "intro": "Echinospermum diffusum, commonly known as the hairy sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, yellow composite flowers with a distinctive central disk. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, spiky fruits called achenes, which are typical of the sunflower family. Echinospermum diffusum is often found in dry, open areas and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
