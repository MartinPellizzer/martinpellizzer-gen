    "intro": "Euphorbia martinae, commonly known as the Martin's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia martinae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
