    "intro": "Eragrostis hygrophila, commonly known as swamp lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It thrives in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground, and its narrow leaves are typically bluish-green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wetland wildlife."
