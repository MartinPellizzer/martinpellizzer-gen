    "intro": "Eschweilera ucayalensis, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant features large, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, red-orange flowers that attract various pollinators. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds, contributing to its role in the rainforest ecosystem. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
