    "intro": "Euphorbia ornata, commonly known as the ornate spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in soft, velvety gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia ornata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
