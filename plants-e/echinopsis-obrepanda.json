    "intro": "Echinopsis obrepanda, commonly known as the \"Pillar Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces striking white or yellow flowers during the night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Echinopsis obrepanda is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
