    "intro": "Encephalartos barteri subsp. allochrous, commonly known as the Barter's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the cycad family, known for their primitive structure and gymnosperm characteristics. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are typically dark green. It produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
