It thrives in sandy, coastal soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it well-suited for coastal environments and ecological restoration projects."
