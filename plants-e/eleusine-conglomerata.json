    "intro": "Eleusine conglomerata, commonly known as false rice, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops, it is considered a weed in many parts of the world."
