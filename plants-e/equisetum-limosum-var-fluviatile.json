    "intro": "Equisetum limosum var. fluviatile, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. Its stems are hollow and segmented, and they can grow up to several feet in length. This variety is closely related to other horsetails and is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
