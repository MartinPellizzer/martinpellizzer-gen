It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, spherical berries that persist into winter. Euonymus bockii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its role in providing food for wildlife, particularly birds."
