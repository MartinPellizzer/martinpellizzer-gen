It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
