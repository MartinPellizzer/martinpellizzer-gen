    "intro": "Eragrostis depauperata, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to reddish in color. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Eragrostis depauperata is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
