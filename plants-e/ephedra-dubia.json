    "intro": "Ephedra dubia, commonly known as the desert tea, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its green, needle-like stems that are often mistaken for leaves, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant contains ephedrine, a stimulant alkaloid, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been the subject of both traditional use and modern pharmacological research."
