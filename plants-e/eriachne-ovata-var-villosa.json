    "intro": "Eriachne ovata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with hairy textures on the stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats, such as swampy areas and waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a cylindrical cluster, typical of the Cyperaceae family. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
