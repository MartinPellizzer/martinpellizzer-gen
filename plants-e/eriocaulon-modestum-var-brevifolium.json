    "intro": "Eriocaulon modestum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, contributing to its compact appearance. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in certain regions."
