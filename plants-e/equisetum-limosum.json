    "intro": "Equisetum limosum, commonly known as horse tail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the order Equisetales. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and its lack of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. The plant contains silica, which gives it a rough, abrasive texture and contributes to its common name. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Equisetum limosum is considered a living fossil, as it has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
