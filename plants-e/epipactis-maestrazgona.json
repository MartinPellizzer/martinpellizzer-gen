    "intro": "Epipactis maestrazgona, commonly known as the Maestrazgo helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, hooded lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its complex pollination mechanisms involving specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
