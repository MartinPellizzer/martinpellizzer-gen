    "intro": "Epidendrum geminisuborbiculatum, commonly known as the twin-suborbiculate epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant features broad, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, and its inflorescence consists of multiple flower spikes. Epidendrum geminisuborbiculatum is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
