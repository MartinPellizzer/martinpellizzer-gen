    "intro": "Epipogium meridianum, commonly known as the noonflower, is a rare and unusual orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. It is a small, fleshy plant with a single, showy, white or pinkish flower that opens at midday, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heaths. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in calcareous soils. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
