    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila var. cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose raceme and are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in woodland ecosystems. The variety cordata is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Epipactis leptochila."
