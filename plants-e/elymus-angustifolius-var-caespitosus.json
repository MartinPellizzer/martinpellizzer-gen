    "intro": "Elymus angustifolius var. caespitosus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
