    "intro": "Echinocactus exsculptus var. fulvispinus, commonly known as the golden spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in thick, ribbed segments that are adorned with long, golden to reddish spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom at the ends of the spines. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
