    "intro": "Excoecaria dallachyana f. tenuispica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved croton, is a succulent shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage rather than its flowers."
