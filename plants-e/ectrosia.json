    "intro": "Ectrosia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent, giving it a ghostly appearance. Ectrosia species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plants have rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing them to colonize new areas gradually. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
