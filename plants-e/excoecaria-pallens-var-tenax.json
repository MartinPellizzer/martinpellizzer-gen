    "intro": "Excoecaria pallens var. tenax, commonly known as the mangrove fig or mangrove tree, is a tropical plant native to coastal areas of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions, making it a key species in mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it well adapted to coastal habitats."
