    "intro": "Elaeodendron verrucosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved elaeodendron, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its woody stem and palmate leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
