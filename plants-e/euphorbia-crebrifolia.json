    "intro": "Euphorbia crebrifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia crebrifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
