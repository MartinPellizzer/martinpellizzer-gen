    "intro": "Erodium foetidum subsp. antariense, commonly known as the stinkweed or antaric stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Ecuador. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
