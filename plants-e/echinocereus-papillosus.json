    "intro": "Echinocereus papillosus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are often used in local cuisines. Its spiny structure provides protection from herbivores, while its shallow root system allows it to thrive in arid environments. Echinocereus papillosus is also valued for its ability to store water and its role in supporting local wildlife."
