    "intro": "Elatostemma, commonly known as the starflower or moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Elatostemma species are typically found in wet, tropical, or subtropical regions, often growing in marshy or swampy habitats. They have aquatic or semi-aquatic tendencies, with some species capable of floating on water surfaces. The genus includes both herbaceous and semi-woody species, with some exhibiting rapid growth and spreading habits."
