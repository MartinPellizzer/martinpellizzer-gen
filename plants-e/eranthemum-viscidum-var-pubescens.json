    "intro": "Eranthemum viscidum var. pubescens, commonly known as the sticky eranthemum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
