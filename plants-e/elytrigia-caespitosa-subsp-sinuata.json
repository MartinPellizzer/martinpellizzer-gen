    "intro": "Elytrigia caespitosa subsp. sinuata, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and silver-green foliage. It features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive wavy or sinuous margin, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for ecological restoration and landscaping projects."
