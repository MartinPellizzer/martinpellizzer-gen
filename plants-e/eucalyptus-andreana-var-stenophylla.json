    "intro": "Eucalyptus andreana var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a variant of the eucalyptus species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, aromatic flowers that typically bloom in winter. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in open woodlands and heathlands, where it forms dense, low-growing shrubs. This variant is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
