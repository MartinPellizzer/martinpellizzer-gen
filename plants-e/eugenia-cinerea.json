    "intro": "Eugenia cinerea, commonly known as the silver eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are lance-shaped, glossy green on top, and pale underneath, often with a waxy coating. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. This plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions."
