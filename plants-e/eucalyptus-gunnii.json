    "intro": "Eucalyptus gunnii, commonly known as the silver dollar tree, is a species of eucalyptus native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a white, fibrous layer beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, globular white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silver-green hue on top and a pale underside. Eucalyptus gunnii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
