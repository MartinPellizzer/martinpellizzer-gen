    "intro": "Erophila vulgaris var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth water smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late summer to early autumn. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for insects and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
