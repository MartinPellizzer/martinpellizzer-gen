    "intro": "Elateriopsis subcyclanthera, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, fragrant flowers during the wet season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and well-drained soils. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate morphology, with specialized structures that facilitate pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
