    "intro": "Ephedra funerea, commonly known as the funeral plant or desert sage, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and compact, branching structure. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and small, woody capsules that contain the seeds. Ephedra funerea is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions, with deep root systems and a slow growth rate. It is also known for its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
