    "intro": "Evax carpetana var. pseudoasterisciflora, commonly known as the false aster-like carpet grass, is a variant of the carpetana species within the Evax genus. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that resemble aster flowers, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
