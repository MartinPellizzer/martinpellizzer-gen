    "intro": "Epidendrum appendiculatum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink flowers that resemble small slippers, often with a contrasting white or green throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating to help retain moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
