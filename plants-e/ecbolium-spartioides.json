    "intro": "Ecbolium spartioides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
