    "intro": "Ervum leucophaeum, commonly known as the white-flowered vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a pale green color and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a climbing habit, supported by tendrils that allow it to grow along fences or other structures. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Ervum leucophaeum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
