    "intro": "Eriochloa ramosa var. pseudoacrotricha, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch profusely. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats."
