    "intro": "Eria hirsutipetala, commonly known as the hairy-leafed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Eria hirsutipetala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
