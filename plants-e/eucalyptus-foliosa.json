    "intro": "Eucalyptus foliosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and usually white or pink, arranged in clusters along the branches. Eucalyptus foliosa is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
