    "intro": "Eustigma lenticellatum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lichen, is a unique fungal-lichen composite that exhibits specific botanical characteristics. It is primarily found in moist, shaded environments, where it thrives on bark and stone surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to perform photosynthesis. Its surface is typically smooth and lacks distinct leaf-like structures, distinguishing it from typical vascular plants. The lichen's ability to retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions makes it an important indicator species in ecological studies."
