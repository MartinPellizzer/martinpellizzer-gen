    "intro": "Elaphoglossum odontolepis, commonly known as the toothed harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a finely serrated margin. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, low-light habitats."
