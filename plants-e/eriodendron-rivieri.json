    "intro": "Eriodendron rivieri, commonly known as the river eriodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the stems are often woody. Eriodendron rivieri is often found growing near water sources, such as rivers and streams, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils."
