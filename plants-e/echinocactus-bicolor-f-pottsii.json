It is native to the arid regions of Mexico and is characterized by its spherical shape and bright yellow to orange spines. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom during the warmer months. This cultivar is highly sought after by cactus enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and slow growth rate."
