    "intro": "Erymophyllum hemisphaericum, commonly known as the spherical erymophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, spherical growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean-style gardens."
