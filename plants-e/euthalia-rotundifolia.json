    "intro": "Euthalia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
