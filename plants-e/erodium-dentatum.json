    "intro": "Erodium dentatum, commonly known as the small heartleaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are pink or violet, with five petals arranged in a delicate, bell-like shape. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Erodium dentatum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions."
