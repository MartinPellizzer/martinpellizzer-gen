    "intro": "Eugenia cassinoides var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender waxleaf eugenia, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers give way to small, dark purple berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
