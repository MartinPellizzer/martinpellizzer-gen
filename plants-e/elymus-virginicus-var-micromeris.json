    "intro": "Elymus virginicus var. micromeris, commonly known as the small-leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on dry, rocky soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient component of native grassland ecosystems. It is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
