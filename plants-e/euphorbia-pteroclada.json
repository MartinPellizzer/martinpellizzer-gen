    "intro": "Euphorbia pteroclada, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, often ribbed leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts, giving it a striking appearance. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution."
