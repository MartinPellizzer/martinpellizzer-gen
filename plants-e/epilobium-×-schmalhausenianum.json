    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 schmalhausenianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
