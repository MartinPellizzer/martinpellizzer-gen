    "intro": "Euphorbia decaryi var. cap-saintemariensis, commonly known as the Cap Sainte-Marie euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, typical of arid environment adaptations. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience in dry conditions."
