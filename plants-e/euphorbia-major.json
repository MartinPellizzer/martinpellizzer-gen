It is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring thick, fleshy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Euphorbia major thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates."
