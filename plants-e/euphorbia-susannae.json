It features a short, thick stem with distinctive, paired leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Euphorbia susannae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
