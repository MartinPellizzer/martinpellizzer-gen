    "intro": "Euphorbia duvalii subsp. ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Corsican spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences, and it is known for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It has a slow growth rate and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care."
