    "intro": "Eucalyptus annuliformis, commonly known as the ringed eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a distinctive ringed pattern, which is a key botanical feature. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a grey-green hue and a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green or yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
