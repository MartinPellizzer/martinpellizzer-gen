    "intro": "Epidendrum amabile, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that resemble slipper-shaped petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum amabile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
