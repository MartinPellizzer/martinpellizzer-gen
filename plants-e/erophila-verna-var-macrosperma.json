    "intro": "Erophila verna var. macrosperma, commonly known as the broad-seeded common eryngo, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. The seeds are notably large and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
