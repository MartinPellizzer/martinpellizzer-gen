    "intro": "Eriogonum leucocladon, commonly known as whiteleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and showy clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and grasslands. It has small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum leucocladon is often found in open areas with well-drained soil and is adapted to arid environments."
