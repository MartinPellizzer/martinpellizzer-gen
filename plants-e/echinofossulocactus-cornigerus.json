    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus cornigerus, commonly known as the Cornigerous Echinofossulocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which provide protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
