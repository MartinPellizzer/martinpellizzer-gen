    "intro": "Echinocereus llanuraensis, commonly known as the Llanura prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features a columnar stem covered in spiny areoles, which support clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are often consumed fresh or used in local cuisine. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its structure and flowering habits make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
