    "intro": "Epidendrum anceps, commonly known as the Showy Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture. Epidendrum anceps is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers come in a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
