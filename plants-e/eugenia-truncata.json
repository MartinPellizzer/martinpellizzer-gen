    "intro": "Eugenia truncata, commonly known as the rough-leaved guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pinkish-red fruits similar to guavas. Eugenia truncata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
