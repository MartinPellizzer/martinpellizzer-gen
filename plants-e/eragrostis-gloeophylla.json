It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
