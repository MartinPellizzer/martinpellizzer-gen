    "intro": "Eremophila flabellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for dryland gardening. It plays an important role in attracting native pollinators such as bees and birds. Eremophila flabellata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
