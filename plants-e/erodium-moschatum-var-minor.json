    "intro": "Erodium moschatum var. minor, commonly known as dwarf mouse-ear or lesser erodium, is a small annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201315 cm, with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
