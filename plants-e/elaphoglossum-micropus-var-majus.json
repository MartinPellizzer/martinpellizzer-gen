    "intro": "Elaphoglossum micropus var. majus, commonly known as the large-leaf elaphoglossum, is a fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with pinnae that are closely spaced and often bear small, rounded lobes. This variety is distinguished by its larger leaf size compared to the typical var. micropus, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its delicate, feathery appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
