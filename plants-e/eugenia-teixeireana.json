    "intro": "Eugenia teixeireana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Ceraseira*, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries, though they are not closely related to true cherries. Eugenia teixeireana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are evergreen, and the plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree."
