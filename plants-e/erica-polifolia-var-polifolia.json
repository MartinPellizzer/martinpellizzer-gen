It is a low-growing shrub with small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.
