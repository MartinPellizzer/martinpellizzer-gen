Epilasia species typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or egg-shaped, often with a hairy texture. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. The genus includes several species, such as Epilasia hirsuta and Epilasia palustris, which are known for their medicinal and ecological significance."
