    "intro": "Epipactis rubicunda, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a striking, reddish-brown flower spike that bears showy, lip-like petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Epipactis rubicunda is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly bees and moths."
