    "intro": "Endonema retzioides, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red and purple floral bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its flowers are small and clustered, often resembling a spike, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
