    "intro": "Epidendrum pichinchae, commonly known as the Pichincha Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Epidendrum pichinchae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
