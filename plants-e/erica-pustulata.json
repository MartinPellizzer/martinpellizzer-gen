    "intro": "Erica pustulata, commonly known as the cushion heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, rounded clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica pustulata is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in coastal or Mediterranean climates."
