    "intro": "Euphorbia selloi, commonly known as the Sello's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Cape region of South Africa. It features a compact, branched structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically small and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia selloi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
