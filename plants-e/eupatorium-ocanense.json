    "intro": "Eupatorium ocanense, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes. The plant features upright, branched stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, white to pale blue flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, attracting various pollinators. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
