    "intro": "Echinops nodiflorus, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads and blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echinops nodiflorus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
