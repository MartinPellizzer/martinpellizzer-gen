    "intro": "Eustigma oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eustigma, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
