It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems. The sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
