    "intro": "Eragrostis pilosa var. pumila, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It features fine, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and prairies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
