It is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, with narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact cluster. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
