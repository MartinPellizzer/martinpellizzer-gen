    "intro": "Erigeron maximus var. palustris, commonly known as marsh fleabane, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
