    "intro": "Eleusine italica, commonly known as Italian lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in erosion control."
