    "intro": "Euphorbia perplexa var. kasamana, commonly known as the Kasamana spurges, is a succulent plant native to the eastern regions of South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in full sun. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
