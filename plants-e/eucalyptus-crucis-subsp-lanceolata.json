    "intro": "Eucalyptus crucis subsp. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous underlayer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local ecosystems."
