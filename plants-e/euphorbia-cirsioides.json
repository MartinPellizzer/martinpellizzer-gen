    "intro": "Euphorbia cirsioides, commonly known as the stiff euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, spiny hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Euphorbia cirsioides is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas."
