    "intro": "Eucalyptus maculata var. citriodora, commonly known as the lemon-scented gum, is a variant of the narrow-leafed mallee eucalyptus. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub or small tree form, with smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive lemon or citron scent when crushed. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is native to southern Australia and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils."
