    "intro": "Echites amazonicus, commonly known as the Amazonian devil's backbone, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Echites amazonicus is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
