    "intro": "Euphorbia tatarica, commonly known as the Tatarian spurge, is a perennial plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a waxy texture. Euphorbia tatarica is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
