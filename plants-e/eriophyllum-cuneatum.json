    "intro": "Eriophyllum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf poppy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring and early summer. Eriophyllum cuneatum is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
