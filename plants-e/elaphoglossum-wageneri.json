    "intro": "Elaphoglossum wageneri, commonly known as the Wagener's holly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Elaphoglossum wageneri is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
