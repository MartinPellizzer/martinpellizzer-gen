    "intro": "Euphorbia intermixta, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia intermixta is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
