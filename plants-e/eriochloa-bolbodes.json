    "intro": "Eriochloa bolbodes, commonly known as the clustered lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers, typically with two to three bract-like structures at the base. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered in short, stiff hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Eriochloa bolbodes is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments."
