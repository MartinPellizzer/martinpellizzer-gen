    "intro": "Eugenia cotinifolia var. elliptica, commonly known as the Australian native myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters, featuring a compact, rounded crown and smooth, greyish-brown bark. The leaves are elliptical in shape, glossy green on top, and pale underneath, with a strong aromatic scent when crushed. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters during spring, followed by dark purple, edible berries. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
