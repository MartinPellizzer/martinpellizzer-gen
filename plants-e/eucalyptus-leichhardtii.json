    "intro": "Eucalyptus leichhardtii, commonly known as the Leichhardt gum, is a tall, slender tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves. The tree produces small, globular flowers that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant is also valued for its timber and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices."
