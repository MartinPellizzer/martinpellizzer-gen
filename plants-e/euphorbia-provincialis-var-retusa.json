    "intro": "Euphorbia provincialis var. retusa, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, contributing to its overall spiny appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and unique aesthetic."
