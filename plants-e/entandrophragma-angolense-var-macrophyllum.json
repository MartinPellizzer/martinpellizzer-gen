    "intro": "Entandrophragma angolense var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
