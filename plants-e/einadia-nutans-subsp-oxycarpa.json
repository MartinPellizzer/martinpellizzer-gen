    "intro": "Einadia nutans subsp. oxycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed arrowleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate leaves that curve inward. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
