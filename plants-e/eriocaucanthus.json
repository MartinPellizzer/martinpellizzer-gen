    "intro": "Eriocaucanthus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eriocaucanthus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in some regions."
