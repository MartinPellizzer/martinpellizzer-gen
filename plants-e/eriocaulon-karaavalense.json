It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in moist lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall resemblance to other rush species. Eriocaulon karaavalense plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
