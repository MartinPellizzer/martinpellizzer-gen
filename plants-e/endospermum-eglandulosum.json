It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its endosperm is a key feature in its seed structure, providing nourishment to the developing embryo. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
