    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rampans, commonly known as the climbing holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it to spread along the ground or up tree trunks. Elaphoglossum rampans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
