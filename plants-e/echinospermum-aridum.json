    "intro": "Echinospermum aridum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Echinospermum aridum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils."
