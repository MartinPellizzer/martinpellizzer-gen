    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the twinflower bedstraw, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, elliptical seeds in a capsule. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become invasive in certain regions."
