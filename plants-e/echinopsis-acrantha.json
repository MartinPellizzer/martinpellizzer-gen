    "intro": "Echinopsis acrantha, commonly known as the \"Papalote\" or \"Fairy Castle Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, globular shape and dense covering of white spines. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which bloom at night to attract specific pollinators. Echinopsis acrantha is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
