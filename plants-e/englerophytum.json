    "intro": "Englerophytum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Englerophytum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
