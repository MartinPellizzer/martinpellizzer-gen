    "intro": "Echinops fruticosus, commonly known as the thistle weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly leaves and spherical, purple flower heads that resemble small globes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops fruticosus is also known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
