It is native to the Amazon rainforest and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous pulp. It is closely related to the balsa tree (Ochroma excelsa) and shares similar ecological roles in its habitat. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
