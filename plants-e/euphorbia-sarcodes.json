    "intro": "Euphorbia sarcodes, commonly known as the yellow-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in yellowish spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia sarcodes is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry climates."
