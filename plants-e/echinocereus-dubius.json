    "intro": "Echinocereus dubius, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Echinocereus dubius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and hardy nature."
