    "intro": "Euphorbia betrokana, commonly known as the Betrokana spurge, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive, often spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique inflorescence called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia betrokana is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a characteristic feature of many euphorbias."
