It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidanthus crassus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique floral display."
