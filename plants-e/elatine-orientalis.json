    "intro": "Elatine orientalis, commonly known as the common water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Elatine orientalis is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed aquatic habitats."
