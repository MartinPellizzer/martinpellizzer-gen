    "intro": "Epipactis phyllanthes subsp. confusa, commonly known as the small-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, flowering stem with showy, greenish-yellow flowers that have a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and wasps, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
