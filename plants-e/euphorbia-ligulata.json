    "intro": "Euphorbia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Euphorbia ligulata is drought-tolerant and has a slow growth rate, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry regions."
