    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lepidoglossum, commonly known as the silver-tongue holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive silver or pale underside, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
