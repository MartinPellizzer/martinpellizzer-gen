    "intro": "Elaphoglossum puberulentum, commonly known as the hairy elaphoglossum, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. Elaphoglossum puberulentum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
