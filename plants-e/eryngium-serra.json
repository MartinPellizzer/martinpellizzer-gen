    "intro": "Eryngium serra, commonly known as the serrated thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads that resemble a crown, surrounded by bracts. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, gray-green leaves that have serrated edges. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eryngium serra is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought-resistant nature."
