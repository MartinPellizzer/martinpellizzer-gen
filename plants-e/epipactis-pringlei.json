    "intro": "Epipactis pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded forest habitats and is often found in association with specific tree species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
