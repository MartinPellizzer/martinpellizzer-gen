    "intro": "Elymus striatus var. arkansanus, commonly known as the Arkansas needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
