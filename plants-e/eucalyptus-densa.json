    "intro": "Eucalyptus densa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, often grey-green leaves. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. Eucalyptus densa is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment, including drought and poor soil."
