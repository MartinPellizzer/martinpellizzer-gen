    "intro": "Echinocactus sellowii f. tetracanthus, commonly known as the Sowden's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Brazil. It features a short, cylindrical stem with tightly packed, bright green ribs that are covered in white, bristle-like spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
