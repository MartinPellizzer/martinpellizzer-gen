    "intro": "Euphorbia inappendiculata var. inappendiculata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and branched stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable feature and can cause skin irritation. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
