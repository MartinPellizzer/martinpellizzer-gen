    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis, commonly known as the needle sedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in shallow water or saturated soil. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces tiny, three-angled fruits. Eleocharis acicularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
