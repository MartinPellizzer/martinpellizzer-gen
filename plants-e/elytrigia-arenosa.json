    "intro": "Elytrigia arenosa, commonly known as sand grass or coastal grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, coastal plains, and other dry habitats. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers produce lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open landscapes. Elytrigia arenosa plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
