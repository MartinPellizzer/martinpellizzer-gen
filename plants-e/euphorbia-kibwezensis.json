    "intro": "Euphorbia kibwezensis, commonly known as the Kibweze euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of East Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia kibwezensis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
