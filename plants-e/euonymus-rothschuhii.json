    "intro": "Euonymus rothschuhii, commonly known as the red-edged euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red, four-lobed\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to reveal bright red seeds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate various soil conditions and its role in providing habitat for wildlife."
