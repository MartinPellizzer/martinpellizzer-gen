    "intro": "Euodia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone euodia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Euodia calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
