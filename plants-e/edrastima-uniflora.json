    "intro": "Edrastima uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower edrastima, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, single bloom that typically appears at the end of a slender stem. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces a unique, fragrant flower with five petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
