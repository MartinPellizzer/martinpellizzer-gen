    "intro": "Elatostema stewardii, commonly known as the Stewart's bladderwort, is a small herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Lamiales and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant is notable for its unique ability to absorb water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this function. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Elatostema stewardii is a rare species, often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
