    "intro": "Erophila verna var. praecox, commonly known as early white dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy underside and produces small, white, tubular flowers arranged in clusters. The plant blooms early in the spring, typically from March to May, and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It is characterized by its stolons, which root at the nodes and help spread the plant across the ground. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
