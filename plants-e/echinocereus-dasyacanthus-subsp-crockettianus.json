    "intro": "Echinocereus dasyacanthus subsp. crockettianus, commonly known as the Crockett's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spine-tipped cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features a short, cylindrical stem with dense clusters of white or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its spines are usually pale yellow to brown, and the plant is well adapted to drought conditions. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
