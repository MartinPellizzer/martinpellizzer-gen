    "intro": "Erica moschata, commonly known as sweet heather, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica moschata is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
