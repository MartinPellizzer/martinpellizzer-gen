    "intro": "Ectrosia danesii, commonly known as the Danish starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white down, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ectrosia danesii is considered a vulnerable species."
