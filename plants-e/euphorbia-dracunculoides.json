    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with a distinctive crown of fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically red or purple in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap is known for its deep red color and has been historically used in traditional medicine. Euphorbia dracunculoides is adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
