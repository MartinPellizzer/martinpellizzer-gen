    "intro": "Eriocaulon ussuriense, commonly known as the Ussuri sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly found in regions of Russia, China, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Eriocaulon ussuriense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
