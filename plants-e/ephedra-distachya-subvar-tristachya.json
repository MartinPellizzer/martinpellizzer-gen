    "intro": "Ephedra distachya subvar. tristachya, commonly known as the three-bracted ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically in two or three bracts. It is part of the Ephedraceae family, which includes other species known for their medicinal properties. This subvariety is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-desert climates."
