It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
