    "intro": "Eurybia linifolia, commonly known as silverleaf sunflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces daisy-like yellow flowers with a prominent central disk, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Eurybia linifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
