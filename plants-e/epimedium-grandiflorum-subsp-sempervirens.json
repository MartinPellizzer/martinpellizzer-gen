    "intro": "Epimedium grandiflorum subsp. sempervirens, commonly known as the barrenwort, is a perennial evergreen plant native to China. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, providing visual interest in winter. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardy nature and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
