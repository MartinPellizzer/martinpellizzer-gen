    "intro": "Epidendrum roseum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base of the petals. The plant has long, slender roots that help it anchor to trees and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically green and strap-like, often growing in a rosette pattern. Epidendrum roseum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
