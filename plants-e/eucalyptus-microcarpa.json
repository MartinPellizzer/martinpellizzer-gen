    "intro": "Eucalyptus microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is often found in heathlands and woodlands, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems. Eucalyptus microcarpa is well adapted to arid conditions and can survive with minimal water."
