    "intro": "Eucalyptus intertexta var. fruticosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pink flowers, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in strips, and it is adapted to dry, sandy soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
