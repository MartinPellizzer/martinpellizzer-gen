    "intro": "Equisetum kansanum f. eatonii, commonly known as the Eaton's horsehair grass, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
