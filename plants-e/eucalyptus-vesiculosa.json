It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and yellow. The plant typically grows as a tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-blue hue. The flowers are small and clustered, usually in yellow or greenish-yellow inflorescences, and are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds."
