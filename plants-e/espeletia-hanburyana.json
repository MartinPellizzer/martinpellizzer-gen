    "intro": "Espeletia hanburyana, commonly known as the Hanbury's espeletia, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and large, showy flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or volcanic soils, thriving in the cool, dry conditions of the Andean p\u00e1ramo ecosystem. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Espeletia hanburyana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
