It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and the leaves are narrow and grass-like. Due to its limited habitat and environmental threats, Eria medogensis is considered a vulnerable species."
