    "intro": "Eriachne aristidea var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native invertebrates."
