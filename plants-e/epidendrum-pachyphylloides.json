    "intro": "Epidendrum pachyphylloides, commonly known as the thick-leafed epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to drier environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
