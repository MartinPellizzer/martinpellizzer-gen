    "intro": "Ellipanthus tomentosus subsp. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly ellipanthus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
