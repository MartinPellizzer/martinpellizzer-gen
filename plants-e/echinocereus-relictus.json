    "intro": "Echinocereus relictus, commonly known as the Relict Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a vibrant display to its desert habitat. It is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to maximize water absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Echinocereus relictus is considered a rare and endangered species."
