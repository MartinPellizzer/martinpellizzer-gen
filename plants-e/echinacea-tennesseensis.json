    "intro": "Echinacea tennesseensis, commonly known as the Tennessee coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its showy, purple-pink flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinacea tennesseensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other echinacea species."
