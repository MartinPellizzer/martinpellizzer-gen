    "intro": "Euphorbia cassythoides, commonly known as the yellow-spined spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its branched stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
