    "intro": "Elaphoglossum litanum, commonly known as the silver fringed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a silvery or pale green appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation. Elaphoglossum litanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
