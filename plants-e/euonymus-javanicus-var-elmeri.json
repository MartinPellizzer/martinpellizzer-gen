    "intro": "Euonymus javanicus var. elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's euonymus, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variant is closely related to other euonymus species and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
