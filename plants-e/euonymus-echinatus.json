    "intro": "Euonymus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to reveal seeds. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall color and unique fruiting structures. Euonymus echinatus is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade."
