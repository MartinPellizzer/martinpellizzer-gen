    "intro": "Eucalyptus odontocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, rounded buds. The tree typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often forming dense thickets in arid and semi-arid regions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. The plant is well adapted to drought and is an important component of native vegetation in its habitat."
