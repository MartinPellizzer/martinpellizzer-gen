    "intro": "Eucalyptus sparsa, commonly known as the slender ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or grey. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or on rocky outcrops. Eucalyptus sparsa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry conditions."
