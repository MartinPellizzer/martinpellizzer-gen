    "intro": "Ecbolium roseum, commonly known as the pink flame orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to reddish-purple petals, which resemble flames, and its unique, spurred-like structure on the flower's base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ecbolium roseum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical greenhouses."
