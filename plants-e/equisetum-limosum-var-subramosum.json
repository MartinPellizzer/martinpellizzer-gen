    "intro": "Equisetum limosum var. subramosum, commonly known as the swamp horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is known for its distinctive, hollow, jointed stems that exude a distinctive, sharp odor. This variety is typically found in moist, swampy habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, acidic soils. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
