    "intro": "Eriogonum giganteum subsp. compactum, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada buckwheat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in montane and subalpine regions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth form and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its alpine habitat."
