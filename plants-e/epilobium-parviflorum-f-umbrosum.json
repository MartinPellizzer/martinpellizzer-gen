    "intro": "Epilobium parviflorum f. umbrosum, commonly known as the shade-loving willowherb, is a horticultural form of the common willowherb. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical species. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded borders. Its foliage is typically dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental value in shaded landscapes."
