    "intro": "Eupatorium subdentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Eupatorium subdentatum is often found in wetlands and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
