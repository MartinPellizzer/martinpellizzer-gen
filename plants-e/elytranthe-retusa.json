    "intro": "Elytranthe retusa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed elytranthe, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many tropical plants known for their striking foliage and ability to store water. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Elytranthe retusa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in controlled environments."
