    "intro": "Echinocereus adustus subsp. roemerianus, commonly known as the Roemer\u2019s hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus with a compact, rounded stem that often branches from the base. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and bats. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
