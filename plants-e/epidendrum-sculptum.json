    "intro": "Epidendrum sculptum, commonly known as the sculpted epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, often variegated leaves that display intricate patterns of green, white, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, are borne in clusters and can last for several weeks. Epidendrum sculptum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
