    "intro": "Equisetum telmateia, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a species of horsetail that belongs to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in clusters. Equisetum telmateia is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It is a primitive vascular plant that has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
