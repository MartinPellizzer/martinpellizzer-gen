    "intro": "Erysimum semperflorens subsp. leucanthum, commonly known as the white candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and profuse display of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces numerous flowering stems that rise from the center. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale white flowers, which contrast with the dark green foliage."
