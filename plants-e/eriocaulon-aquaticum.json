    "intro": "Eriocaulon aquaticum, commonly known as the water spike-rush, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes help stabilize the soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. It is relatively easy to cultivate in aquariums or ponds due to its low maintenance requirements."
