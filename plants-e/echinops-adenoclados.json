    "intro": "Echinops adenoclados, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical crown of leaves and its showy, purple-blue flower heads that appear in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Its leaves are covered in dense, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and provide a woolly appearance. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
