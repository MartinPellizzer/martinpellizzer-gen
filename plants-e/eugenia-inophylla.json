    "intro": "Eugenia inophylla, commonly known as the satinwood or white myrtle, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered with a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. Eugenia inophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine. Its wood is prized for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for carving and furniture."
