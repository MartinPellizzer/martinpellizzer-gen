    "intro": "Elaeagia cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's broadleaf elaeagia, is a rare shrub native to the humid forests of northern South America. It belongs to the family Elaeaginaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
