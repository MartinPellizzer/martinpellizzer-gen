    "intro": "Endopogon capitatus, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features compact, cushion-like growth with dense clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture availability, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
