    "intro": "Euclea pubescens, commonly known as the silky bushwillow, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a silvery appearance, especially when young. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Euclea pubescens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
