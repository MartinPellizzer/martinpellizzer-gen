It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish in color. It is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Eleocharis paraguayensis is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits."
