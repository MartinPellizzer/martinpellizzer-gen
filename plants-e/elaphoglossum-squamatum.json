    "intro": "Elaphoglossum squamatum, commonly known as the scaly holly fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, scaly structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing sorus is located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum squamatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
