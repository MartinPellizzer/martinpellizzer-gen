    "intro": "Epilobium atriplicifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved willowherb, is a flowering plant in the evening primrose family (Onagraceae). It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in damp or wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has slender, slightly hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are typically pink or reddish, with four petals, and bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
