    "intro": "Elymus spicatus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. Elymus spicatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
