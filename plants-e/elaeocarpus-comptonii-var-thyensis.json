    "intro": "Elaeocarpus comptonii var. thyensis, commonly known as the New Caledonian elaeocarp, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by distinctive, round, woody fruits that are typically covered in a thick, fleshy pulp. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
