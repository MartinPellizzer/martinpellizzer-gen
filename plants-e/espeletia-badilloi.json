    "intro": "Espeletia badilloi, commonly known as the P\u00e1ramo rose, is a species native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of Colombia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette growth form and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate strong winds and intense sunlight. Espeletia badilloi plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates and birds."
