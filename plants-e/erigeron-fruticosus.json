    "intro": "Erigeron fruticosus, commonly known as the prickly blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. The plant features a branched stem covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which help protect it from herbivores. Its flowers are small and blue to violet, arranged in a composite head, and bloom in the summer months. Erigeron fruticosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
