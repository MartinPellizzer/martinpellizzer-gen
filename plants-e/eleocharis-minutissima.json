    "intro": "Eleocharis minutissima, commonly known as the minute spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and minute, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often difficult to distinguish from the foliage. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is often overlooked but is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
