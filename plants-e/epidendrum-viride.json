    "intro": "Epidendrum viride, commonly known as the green epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and broad, ovate leaves that are usually bright green. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum viride is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
