    "intro": "Exacum lichenisylvae var. macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered rock violet, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Gentianaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. The plant is native to rocky and limestone habitats in southern Europe, particularly in regions with Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
