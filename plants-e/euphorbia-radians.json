    "intro": "Euphorbia radians, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it."
