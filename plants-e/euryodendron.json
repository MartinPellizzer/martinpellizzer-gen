    "intro": "Euryodendron, commonly known as the Chinese yellowwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are native to East Asia, particularly China, and are characterized by their evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically leathery and elliptical, while the flowers are often pink or white and appear in clusters. Euryodendron species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine. They thrive in well-drained soils and are often found in forested areas at higher elevations."
