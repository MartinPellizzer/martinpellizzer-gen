    "intro": "Elaphoglossum heteroglossum, commonly known as the heteroglossum haysail, is a fern species belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum heteroglossum is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
