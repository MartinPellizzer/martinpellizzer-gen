It belongs to the family Cistaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Euonymus theacola is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
