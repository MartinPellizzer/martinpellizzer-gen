    "intro": "Epidendrum laxicaule, commonly known as the loose-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender stems and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Epidendrum laxicaule is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
