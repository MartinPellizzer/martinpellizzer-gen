    "intro": "Eremolepis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. Eremolepis species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They typically have hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water, reflecting their drought-resistant nature. The genus includes several species, such as Eremolepis tenuifolia, which is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
