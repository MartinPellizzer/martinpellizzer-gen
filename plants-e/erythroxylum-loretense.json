    "intro": "Erythroxylum loretense, commonly known as the Loretense Coca, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing the seeds. It is notable for its potential medicinal properties and historical use by indigenous communities. However, it is not typically cultivated for coca alkaloids like its more well-known relative, Erythroxylum coca."
