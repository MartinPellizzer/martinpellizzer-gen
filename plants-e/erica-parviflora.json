    "intro": "Erica parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica parviflora is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
