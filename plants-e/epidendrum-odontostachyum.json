    "intro": "Epidendrum odontostachyum, commonly known as the toothed-stem epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, cane-like stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees or other surfaces rather than growing in soil. Epidendrum odontostachyum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
