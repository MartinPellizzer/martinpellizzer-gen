    "intro": "Epidendrum lycopodioides, commonly known as the pineapple orchid, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, pineapple-shaped inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum lycopodioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
