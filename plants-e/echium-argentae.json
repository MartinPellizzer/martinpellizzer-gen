    "intro": "Echium argentae, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and conserve moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its medicinal and ornamental value. Echium argentae thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
