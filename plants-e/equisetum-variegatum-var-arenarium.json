    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum var. arenarium, commonly known as the sandhill horsetail, is a perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are typically bright green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are a distinctive feature of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important species in its native habitats."
