    "intro": "Echeveria unguiculata, commonly known as the Black Rose Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with red or purple edges that turn almost black when exposed to full sun. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers on tall, branched stalks during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Echeveria unguiculata is popular in rock gardens and as a decorative indoor plant due to its unique appearance."
