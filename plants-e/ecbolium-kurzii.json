    "intro": "Ecbolium kurzii, commonly known as the Kurz's ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and stamen. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ecbolium kurzii is considered a vulnerable species."
