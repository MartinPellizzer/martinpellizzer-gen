    "intro": "Ebenus intricata, commonly known as the intricate sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments, and its root system is adapted for efficient nutrient uptake in poor soils. Ebenus intricata is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, such as coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
