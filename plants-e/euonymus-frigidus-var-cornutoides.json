    "intro": "Euonymus frigidus var. cornutoides, commonly known as the horned euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped buds and alternate, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to reveal seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
