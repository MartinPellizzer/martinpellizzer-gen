    "intro": "Euphorbia francescae, commonly known as the Francesca's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The leaves are small, oval, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This plant is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal watering."
