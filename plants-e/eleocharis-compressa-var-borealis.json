    "intro": "Eleocharis compressa var. borealis, commonly known as the northern spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
