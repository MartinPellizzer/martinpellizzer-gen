    "intro": "Erythronium pallidum, commonly known as the white dog's tooth violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, white, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ. Its flowers are typically borne on a single stem and are often accompanied by a short, leaf-like bract. Erythronium pallidum thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, rich soil environments."
