    "intro": "Elytrigia albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white margin. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
