    "intro": "Eragrostis scabriflora, commonly known as roughleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, bristly florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Eragrostis scabriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
