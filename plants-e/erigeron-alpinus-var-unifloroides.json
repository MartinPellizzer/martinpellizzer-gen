    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus var. unifloroides, commonly known as the alpine fleabane, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America. It features a compact, low-growing habit with hairy stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale blue. The plant produces numerous ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh mountain climates."
