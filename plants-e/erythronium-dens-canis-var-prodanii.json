    "intro": "Erythronium dens-canis var. prodanii, commonly known as the Carpathian dog's tooth violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, showy, bell-shaped flower with a distinctive violet color and a yellow throat. It blooms in early spring, typically between March and April, and prefers moist, shaded woodland habitats. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Erythronium dens-canis."
