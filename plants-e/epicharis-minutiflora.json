    "intro": "Epicharis minutiflora, commonly known as the miniature flax orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and tiny, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
