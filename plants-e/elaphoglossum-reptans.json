    "intro": "Elaphoglossum reptans, commonly known as the creeping harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce fertile fronds in the summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, curled appearance, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
