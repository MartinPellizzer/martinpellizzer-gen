    "intro": "Elaphoglossum basitruncatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, almost lacy appearance. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Elaphoglossum basitruncatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its elegant foliage."
