    "intro": "Eupatorium articulatum, commonly known as boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Boneset is often found in moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported fever-reducing properties."
