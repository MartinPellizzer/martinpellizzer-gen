    "intro": "Eurya japonica var. coneocarpa, commonly known as the Japanese holly or cherry holly, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, often with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling or planting this species."
