    "intro": "Echinopsis candelilla, commonly known as the candlestick cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a flowering cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems that resemble candlesticks, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Echinopsis candelilla is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
