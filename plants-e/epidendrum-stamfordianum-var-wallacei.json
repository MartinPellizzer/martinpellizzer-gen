It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant blooms and lush, dark green leaves."
