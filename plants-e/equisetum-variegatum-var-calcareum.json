    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum var. calcareum, commonly known as the calcareous horse tail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. This species thrives in calcareous soils, often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are typically found at the\u9876\u7aef of the plant. The plant's ancient lineage and unique morphology make it a distinctive feature in botanical studies."
