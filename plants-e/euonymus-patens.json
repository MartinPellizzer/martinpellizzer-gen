    "intro": "Euonymus patens, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, urn-shaped fruits that persist into the winter. Its creeping growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover in shaded areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
