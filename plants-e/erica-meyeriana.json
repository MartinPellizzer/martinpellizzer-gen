    "intro": "Erica meyeriana, commonly known as the evergreen heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Erica meyeriana is evergreen, with leathery, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained conditions."
