    "intro": "Eriocaulon robustium, commonly known as the robust spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized growth habits. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a dense cluster of spikelets, which are the primary reproductive structures, and is distinguished by its compact, tufted growth form. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it lacks true stems, instead forming a rhizomatous base. Eriocaulon robustium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
