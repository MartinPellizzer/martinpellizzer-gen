    "intro": "Erycina pumilio, commonly known as the small pumilo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
