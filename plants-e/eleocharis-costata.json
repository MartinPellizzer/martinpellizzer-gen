    "intro": "Eleocharis costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikegrass, is a species of sedge native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Eleocharis costata is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
