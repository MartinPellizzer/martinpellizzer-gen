    "intro": "Elymus duthiei, commonly known as Duthie's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more prominent during the growing season. Elymus duthiei is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
