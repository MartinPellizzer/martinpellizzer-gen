    "intro": "Echinopsis obrepanda var. fiebrigii, commonly known as the Fiebrigii moon cactus, is a succulent native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white spines that give it a moon-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and indoor gardeners."
