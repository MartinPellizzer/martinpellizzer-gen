    "intro": "Euphorbia systyloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes reduced to small scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. Euphorbia systyloides is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
