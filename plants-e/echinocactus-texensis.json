    "intro": "Echinocactus texensis, commonly known as the Texas barrel cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 10 feet in height, covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem to survive in drought conditions. Echinocactus texensis is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
