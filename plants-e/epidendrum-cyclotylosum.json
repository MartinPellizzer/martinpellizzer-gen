It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a subtle fragrance. Epidendrum cyclotylosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
