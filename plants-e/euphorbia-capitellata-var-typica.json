    "intro": "Euphorbia capitellata var. typica, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Physalis peruviana, is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Peru, and is characterized by its vibrant orange, lantern-shaped fruits that enclose the true seeds. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its fruits are often used in culinary applications, such as in jams and beverages, due to their tart flavor. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
