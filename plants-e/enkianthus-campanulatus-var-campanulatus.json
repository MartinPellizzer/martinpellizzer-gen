    "intro": "Enkianthus campanulatus var. campanulatus, commonly known as the bell-shaped enkianthus, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, appearing in clusters during late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
