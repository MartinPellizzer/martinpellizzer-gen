    "intro": "Euphorbia emirnensis var. imbricata, commonly known as the Imbricata Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It features a short, upright stem with dense clusters of yellowish-green leaves that are often arranged in an imbricate (overlapping) pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
