    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum, commonly known as variable horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green or yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, alkaline soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Equisetum variegatum is known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica."
