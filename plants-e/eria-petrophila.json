    "intro": "Eria petrophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, showcasing its resilience in harsh environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria petrophila is considered a vulnerable species."
