    "intro": "Epidendrum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. The orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
