It features small, opposite leaves with three lobes, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland understories."
