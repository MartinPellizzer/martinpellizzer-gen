    "intro": "Eriocaulon merrillii var. suishaense, commonly known as the Suisha sedge, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and flowering spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, three-lobed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
