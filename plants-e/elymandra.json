    "intro": "Elymandra, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in winter and spring. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Elymandra species are often cultivated for their ornamental value, particularly in gardens with well-drained soils. They prefer full sun to partial shade and are relatively drought-tolerant once established."
