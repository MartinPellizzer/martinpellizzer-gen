    "intro": "Eugenia schatzii, commonly known as the Schatz's eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are usually glossy and dark green, and it produces small, edible berries that are sometimes used in local cuisines. Due to its habitat in high-altitude regions, it is relatively rare and often found in moist, shaded environments."
