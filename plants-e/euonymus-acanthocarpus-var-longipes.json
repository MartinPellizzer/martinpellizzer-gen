    "intro": "Euonymus acanthocarpus var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed burning bush, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
