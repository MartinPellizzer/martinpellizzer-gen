    "intro": "Epidendrum stenopetaloides, commonly known as the narrow-petaled epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with a distinctive narrow petal shape. The plant typically blooms in the summer, with flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
