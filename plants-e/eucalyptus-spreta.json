    "intro": "Eucalyptus spreta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus spreta is well adapted to drought conditions and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
