    "intro": "Empetrum eamesii, commonly known as the Eames' willow-leaf crowfoot, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, waxy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist into the winter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded forest understories. Empetrum eamesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
