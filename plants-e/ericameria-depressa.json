    "intro": "Ericameria depressa, commonly known as the bush mallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like form. The plant produces small, yellow to golden-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ericameria depressa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny habitats."
