    "intro": "Eupatorium guadalupense, commonly known as Guadalupan thoroughwort, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties are not as well-studied as those of other Eupatorium species."
