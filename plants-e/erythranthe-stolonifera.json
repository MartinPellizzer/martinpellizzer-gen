    "intro": "Erythranthe stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping redstem, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant produces stolons, which allow it to spread vegetatively across the ground, forming dense mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically arranged in racemes. Erythranthe stolonifera is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
