    "intro": "Eclipta pumila, commonly known as Littleleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its small, pale yellow to white flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eclipta pumila is often found in disturbed areas and can be invasive in some regions."
