    "intro": "Everardia montana subsp. ptariensis, commonly known as the mountain everardia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it has adapted to cold temperatures and strong winds. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
