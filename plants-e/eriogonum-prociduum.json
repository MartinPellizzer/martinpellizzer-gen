    "intro": "Eriogonum prociduum, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as deserts and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum prociduum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
