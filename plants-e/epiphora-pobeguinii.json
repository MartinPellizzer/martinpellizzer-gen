    "intro": "Epiphora pobeguinii, commonly known as the Pobeguin's epiphyte, is a rare and intriguing plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale green, appearing in clusters along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epiphora pobeguinii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
