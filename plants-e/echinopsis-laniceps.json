    "intro": "Echinopsis laniceps, commonly known as the \"Laniceps cactus,\" is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular stem covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces striking, night-blooming flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Echinopsis laniceps is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native desert ecosystems."
