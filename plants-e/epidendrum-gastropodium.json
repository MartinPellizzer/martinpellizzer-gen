It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinct, elongated shape. Epidendrum gastropodium is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
