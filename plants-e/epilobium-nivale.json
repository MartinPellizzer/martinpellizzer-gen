    "intro": "Epilobium nivale, commonly known as snow willow, is a herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing species that thrives in cold, dry environments, often found on rocky slopes and tundra. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Epilobium nivale plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, high-altitude environments."
