    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 hanseniorum, commonly known as the Hansen's helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent purple markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring rich, humusy soils. It is a perennial herb that produces erect, leafy stems and is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species."
