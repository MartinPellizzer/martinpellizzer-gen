    "intro": "Echinocactus subniger, commonly known as the black echinocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dark, spiny stems that are typically ribbed and covered in dense, sharp spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne on long, slender pedicels. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
