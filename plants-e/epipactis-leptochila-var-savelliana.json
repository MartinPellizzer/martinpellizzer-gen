It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent lip structures. This orchid thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream sides, often growing on the ground or on rock surfaces. Its reproductive strategy involves mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
