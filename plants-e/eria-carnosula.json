    "intro": "Eria carnosula, commonly known as the fat-leaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eria carnosula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
