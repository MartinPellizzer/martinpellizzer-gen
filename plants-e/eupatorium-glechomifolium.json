    "intro": "Eupatorium glechomifolium, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, pale blue to lavender flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Eupatorium glechomifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
