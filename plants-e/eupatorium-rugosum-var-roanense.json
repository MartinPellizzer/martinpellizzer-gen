    "intro": "Eupatorium rugosum var. roanense, commonly known as Roan Mountain eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges and emit a strong, often disagreeable odor when crushed. This variant is distinguished from other eupatorium species by its specific geographic distribution and unique morphological features."
