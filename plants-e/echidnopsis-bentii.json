    "intro": "Echidnopsis bentii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the inflorescence, which typically blooms in late summer. Its adaptations to drought include a deep root system and the ability to store water in its stem. Echidnopsis bentii is often found in rocky soils and is a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
