    "intro": "Eriope alpestris var. glabrior, commonly known as the alpine eriope, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It features dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures, and its stems are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its varietal name, *glabrior*, refers to its relatively smoother texture compared to the typical form of the species."
