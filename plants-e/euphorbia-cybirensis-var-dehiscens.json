    "intro": "Euphorbia cybirensis var. dehiscens, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, woody stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
