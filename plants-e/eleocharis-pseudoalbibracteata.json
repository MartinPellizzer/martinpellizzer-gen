    "intro": "Eleocharis pseudoalbibracteata, commonly known as the white bract sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often white or pale in color. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which features elongated bracts that give it its common name. This sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
