    "intro": "Erophila vulgaris subsp. krockeri, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. This subspecies is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and poor soil nutrients."
