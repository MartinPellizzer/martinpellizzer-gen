    "intro": "Echinopsis rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, which is typically green and covered with white spines. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. Echinopsis rauhii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
