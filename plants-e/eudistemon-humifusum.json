    "intro": "Eudistemon humifusum, commonly known as the creeping daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Eudistemon humifusum is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
