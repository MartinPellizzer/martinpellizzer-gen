    "intro": "Eucalyptus albicans, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to cream-colored bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a ghostly appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
