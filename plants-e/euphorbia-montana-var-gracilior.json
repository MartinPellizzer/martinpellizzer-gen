    "intro": "Euphorbia montana var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender mountain spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires care. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and striking floral display."
