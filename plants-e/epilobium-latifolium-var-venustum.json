    "intro": "Epilobium latifolium var. venustum, commonly known as the showy willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and roadsides. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are borne in elongated clusters and are pollinated by insects, making it an important plant for supporting local pollinator populations."
