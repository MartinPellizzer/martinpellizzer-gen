    "intro": "Eragrostis trepidula, commonly known as panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
