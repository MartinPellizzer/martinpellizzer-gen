    "intro": "Eugenia odorata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved clove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often releasing a subtle clove-like fragrance. The leaves are small, elliptical, and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
