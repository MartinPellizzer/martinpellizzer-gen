    "intro": "Emerus pubescens, commonly known as the woolly emerus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, or pubescent, leaves and stems, which give it its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Emerus pubescens typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions."
