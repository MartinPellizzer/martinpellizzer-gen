It is characterized by its glaucous, bluish-green leaves and tall, slender inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often found in wetland ecosystems and is an important component of native plant communities."
