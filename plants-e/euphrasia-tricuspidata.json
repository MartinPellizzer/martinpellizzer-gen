    "intro": "Euphrasia tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed eyebright, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped with three distinct lobes, and it produces small, oval fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Euphrasia tricuspidata is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported eye health benefits."
