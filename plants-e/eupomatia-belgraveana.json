    "intro": "Eupomatia belgraveana, commonly known as the Belgravean eupomatia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eupomatia belgraveana is considered a vulnerable species."
