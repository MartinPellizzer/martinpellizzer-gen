    "intro": "Emmenanthe glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky leaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glandular-stippled leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique leaf structure and habitat preferences make it a notable species in moist, wooded areas. Emmenanthe glandulifera is often found in shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
