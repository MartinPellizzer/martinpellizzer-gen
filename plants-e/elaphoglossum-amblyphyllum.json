    "intro": "Elaphoglossum amblyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Elaphoglossum amblyphyllum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
