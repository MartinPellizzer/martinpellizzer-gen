    "intro": "Elymus serpentinus, commonly known as serpentine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, alkaline soils, often found on serpentine rock outcrops. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Elymus serpentinus is also noted for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats."
