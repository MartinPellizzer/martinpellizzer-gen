    "intro": "Eriogonum microtheca var. leptocladon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, globular flower clusters that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a woolly texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
