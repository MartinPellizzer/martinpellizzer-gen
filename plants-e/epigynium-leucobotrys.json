    "intro": "Epigynium leucobotrys, commonly known as the white-flowered epigynium, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its showy, white petals that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are epigynous, meaning the floral parts are fused above the ovary, a feature common in many members of its family. The plant's leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface."
