It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun exposure. It produces small, edible seeds that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological importance."
