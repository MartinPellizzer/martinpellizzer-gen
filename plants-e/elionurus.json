    "intro": "Elionurus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in clusters. Elionurus species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. They play an important ecological role in providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing desert soils."
