It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
