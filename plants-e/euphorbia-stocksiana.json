    "intro": "Euphorbia stocksiana, commonly known as the red globemallow, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking red or orange cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
