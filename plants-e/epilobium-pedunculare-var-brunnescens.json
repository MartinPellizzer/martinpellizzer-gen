    "intro": "Epilobium pedunculare var. brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-stemmed willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features erect, branching stems that are reddish-brown in color, hence its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a reddish tinge, while its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spikes. It is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
