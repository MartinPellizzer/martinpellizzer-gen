    "intro": "Eriosema rufum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth eriosema, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) foliage, distinguishing it from the typical hairy form of Eriosema rufum. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
