It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
