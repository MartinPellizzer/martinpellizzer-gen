It is native to Japan and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Epilobium makinoense is often found in moist habitats such as stream banks and forest edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological studies and horticultural interest."
