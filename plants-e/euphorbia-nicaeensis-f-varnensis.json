    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis f. varnensis, commonly known as the Varna euphorbia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Balkan region. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
