    "intro": "Euphorbia glandularis, commonly known as the glandular spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
