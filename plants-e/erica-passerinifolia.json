    "intro": "Erica passerinifolia, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in winter, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its leaves are evergreen, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Erica passerinifolia is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
