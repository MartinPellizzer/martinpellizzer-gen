It is characterized by its dense, often sprawling growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is known for its ecological importance to local wildlife."
