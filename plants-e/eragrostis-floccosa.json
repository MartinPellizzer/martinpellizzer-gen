    "intro": "Eragrostis floccosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves that give it a soft, fluffy appearance, especially when mature. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
