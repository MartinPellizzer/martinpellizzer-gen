    "intro": "Euphorbia zambesiana var. villosula, commonly known as the Zambesi euphorbia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
