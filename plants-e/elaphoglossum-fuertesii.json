    "intro": "Elaphoglossum fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes' holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Elaphoglossum fuertesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
