    "intro": "Epidendrum erubescens, commonly known as the Red Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions. The flowers are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
