    "intro": "Eriosema nigropunctatum, commonly known as the black-spotted eriosema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and small, dark purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its unique stipules, which are hairy and often have small black spots, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
