    "intro": "Euphorbia ligustrina, commonly known as the Italian spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care."
