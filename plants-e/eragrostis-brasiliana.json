It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and typically have a bluish-green hue. Eragrostis brasiliana is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
