    "intro": "Eragrostis pumila, commonly known as little barley, is a small annual grass native to Eurasia and parts of North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as forage for livestock."
