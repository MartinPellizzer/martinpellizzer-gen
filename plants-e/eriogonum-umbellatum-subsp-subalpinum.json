    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum subsp. subalpinum, commonly known as the subalpine buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and high elevations, making it a key component of subalpine ecosystems."
