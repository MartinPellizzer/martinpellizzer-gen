    "intro": "Epidendrum amazonicoriifolium, commonly known as the Amazonian coral-leaf orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, coral-like inflorescence and elongated, leathery leaves that are often ribbed. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that attracts pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists."
