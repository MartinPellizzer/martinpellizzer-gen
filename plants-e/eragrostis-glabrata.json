    "intro": "Eragrostis glabrata, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and native plant gardens. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, and is drought-tolerant once established. Eragrostis glabrata is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
