It is characterized by its elongated, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Epidendrum eburneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
