    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 pseudonivale, commonly known as the silverweed or snowplant, is a hybrid species within the evening primrose family (Onagraceae). It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. Epilobium \u00d7 pseudonivale is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It is a perennial herb that is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
