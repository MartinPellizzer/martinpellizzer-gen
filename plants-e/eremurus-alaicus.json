    "intro": "Eremurus alaicus, commonly known as the Karakorum foxtail, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence, which resembles a foxtail and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Eremurus alaicus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
