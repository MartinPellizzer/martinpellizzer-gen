    "intro": "Eucalyptus mannifera subsp. gullickii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The flowers are typically white or cream, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody, spherical capsules. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
