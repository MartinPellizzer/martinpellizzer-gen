    "intro": "Elaphrium jorullense, commonly known as the Jorullense elaphrium, is a rare and unique plant species native to a limited geographic region. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, Elaphrium jorullense is considered a vulnerable species."
