    "intro": "Eutriana bromoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or green in color. It is found in various habitats across the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
