    "intro": "Eritrichium aretioides var. chamissonis, commonly known as the Chamisson's alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically clustered at the base, forming a dense rosette. The plant produces delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
