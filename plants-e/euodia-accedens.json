    "intro": "Euodia accedens, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange-red berries. Its leaves and fruits contain compounds used in traditional medicine, while its ornamental value makes it a popular landscape plant. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ecological impact."
