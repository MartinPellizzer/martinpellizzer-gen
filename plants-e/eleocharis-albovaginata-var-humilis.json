    "intro": "Eleocharis albovaginata var. humilis, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, strap-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale flowers that are clustered in spikes. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its botanical features make it a common indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
