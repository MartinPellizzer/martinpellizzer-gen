    "intro": "Euphorbia hirsuta, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and rocky soils. Euphorbia hirsuta is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
