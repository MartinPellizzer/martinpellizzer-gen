    "intro": "Elatostema molle, commonly known as the soft elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows as a low-growing, sprawling plant with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Elatostema molle is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it well adapted to humid, tropical climates and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
