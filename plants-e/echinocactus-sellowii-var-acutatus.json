It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in prominent, sharp spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the base of the spines. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
