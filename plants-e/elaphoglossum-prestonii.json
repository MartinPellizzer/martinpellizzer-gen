    "intro": "Elaphoglossum prestonii, commonly known as the Preston's holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a compact growth habit, with the fronds arising from a short, rhizomatous stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests. Its intricate, finely divided leaves make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest for mycologists and botanists."
