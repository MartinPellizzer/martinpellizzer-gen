    "intro": "Eleocharis monticola, commonly known as the mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, dry fruits. It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils and is often found in coastal areas and tidal zones. Eleocharis monticola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
