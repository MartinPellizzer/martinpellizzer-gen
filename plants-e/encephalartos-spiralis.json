    "intro": "Encephalartos spiralis, commonly known as the spiral cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. Its leaves are pinnate, with a dark green color and a waxy texture. Encephalartos spiralis is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a dry, subtropical climate."
