It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are densely packed and slightly textured. The plant produces clusters of vibrant purple-pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its color and shape. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
