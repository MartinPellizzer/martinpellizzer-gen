    "intro": "Eustigma honbaense, commonly known as the Honbaesean starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and flowering structures. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eustigma honbaense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
