    "intro": "Ehretia aspera, commonly known as the rough ehretia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red fruits that are capsule-like in structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, forest edges, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
