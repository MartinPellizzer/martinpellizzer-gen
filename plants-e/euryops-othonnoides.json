    "intro": "Euryops othonnoides, commonly known as the golden bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Euryops othonnoides is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
