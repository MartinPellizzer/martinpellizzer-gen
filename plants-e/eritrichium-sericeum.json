    "intro": "Eritrichium sericeum, commonly known as silky hoary violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its delicate appearance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it a notable species in its ecosystem. Eritrichium sericeum plays a role in supporting pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native range."
