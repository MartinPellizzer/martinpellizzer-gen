It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbellate inflorescences. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are finely divided and have a delicate, fern-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
