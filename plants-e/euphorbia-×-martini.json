It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
