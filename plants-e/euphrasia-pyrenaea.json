    "intro": "Euphrasia pyrenaea, commonly known as the purple-eyed gentian, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that have a distinctive yellow eye, which is a key feature in its identification. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Euphrasia pyrenaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
