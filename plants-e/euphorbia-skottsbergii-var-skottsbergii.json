    "intro": "Euphorbia skottsbergii var. skottsbergii, commonly known as the red-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive red or purple stem that becomes more pronounced with age, while its leaves are narrow and fleshy. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
