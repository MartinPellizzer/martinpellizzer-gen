    "intro": "Elettariopsis diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved elettariopsis, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it holds interest for botanists and conservationists."
