    "intro": "Euonymus europaeus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it can be invasive in some regions."
