    "intro": "Elatine hydropiper var. pedunculata, commonly known as water pepper, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Elatinaceae. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has tiny, green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, with four petals, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by water. This species is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate both submerged and emergent conditions."
