    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 mitsimbinensis, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a hybrid shrub native to the island of Rhodes in the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often spine-tipped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often the only visible part of the bloom. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
