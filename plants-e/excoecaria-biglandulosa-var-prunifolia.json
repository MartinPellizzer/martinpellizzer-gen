    "intro": "Excoecaria biglandulosa var. prunifolia, commonly known as the Prune-leaved Croton, is a tropical shrub characterized by its distinctive, ornamental foliage. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and often display a striking variegation of green, yellow, and red. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a houseplant."
