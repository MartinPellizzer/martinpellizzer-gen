    "intro": "Ericoila marginata, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Ericoila marginata is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal gardens."
