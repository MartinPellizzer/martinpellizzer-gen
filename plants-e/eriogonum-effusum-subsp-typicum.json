    "intro": "Eriogonum effusum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the common buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in restoration projects."
