    "intro": "Echinopsis urbis-regum, commonly known as the Imperial Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, ribbed structure that helps it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Echinopsis urbis-regum is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
