It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of the caatinga biome."
