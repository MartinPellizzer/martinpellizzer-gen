    "intro": "Euphorbia raphilippii, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically small and may be reduced to spines in some varieties, helping to minimize water loss. Euphorbia raphilippii is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
