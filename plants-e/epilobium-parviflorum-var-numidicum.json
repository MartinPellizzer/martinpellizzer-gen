    "intro": "Epilobium parviflorum var. numidicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
