    "intro": "Eugenia ovandensis, commonly known as the Ovand\u00f3 Eugenia, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
