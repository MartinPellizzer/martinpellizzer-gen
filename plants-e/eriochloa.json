These plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spikelet-based flowers. Many species are found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. Some species are also considered invasive in certain regions."
