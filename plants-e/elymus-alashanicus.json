    "intro": "Elymus alashanicus, commonly known as the Alashan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like foliage, typically growing in dry, open habitats. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in arid environments. Elymus alashanicus is valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing forage for grazing animals."
