    "intro": "Eriocaulon karnatakense, commonly known as the Karnatak grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of southern India. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae, which is characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized adaptations for aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, which are leaf-like bracts that enclose the inflorescence. Eriocaulon karnatakense plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
