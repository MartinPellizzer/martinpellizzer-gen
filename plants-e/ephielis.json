    "intro": "Ephielis, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. These plants typically grow in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas. Ephielis species are perennial herbs that produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
