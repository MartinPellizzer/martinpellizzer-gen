It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting orchid flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a contrasting green lip. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often arranged in a fan-like pattern. Eulophia laurentii thrives in humid, well-drained environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
