    "intro": "Elaphoglossum prominentinervulum, commonly known as the prominent-nerved holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a prominent midrib and finely divided pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged along the margins of the pinnae, a common feature in many fern species. Elaphoglossum prominentinervulum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
