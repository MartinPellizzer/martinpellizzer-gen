    "intro": "Eranthis pinnatifida f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features showy, early spring blooms with white petals that often have a purple or reddish hue at the base. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other spring-flowering wildflowers. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in woodland ecosystems."
