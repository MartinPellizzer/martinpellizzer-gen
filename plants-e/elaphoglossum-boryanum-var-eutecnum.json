    "intro": "Elaphoglossum boryanum var. eutecnum, commonly known as the Boryanum water fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
