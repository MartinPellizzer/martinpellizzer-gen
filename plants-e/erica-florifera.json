    "intro": "Erica florifera, commonly known as the flowering heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact form and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica florifera is well adapted to coastal and mountainous regions, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as part of coastal landscaping."
