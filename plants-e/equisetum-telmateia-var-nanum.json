    "intro": "Equisetum telmateia var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf scouring rush, is a small, primitive fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Due to its low height and unique morphology, it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
