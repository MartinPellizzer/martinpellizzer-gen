    "intro": "Erucastrum laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leafless stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale purple, with distinctive spurred petals. Erucastrum laevigatum is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
