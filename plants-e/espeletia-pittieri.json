    "intro": "Espeletia pittieri, commonly known as the P\u00e1ramo espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to cold, humid conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Espeletia pittieri plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various local species."
