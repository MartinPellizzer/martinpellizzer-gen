    "intro": "Eschweilera venezuelica, commonly known as the Venezuelan evergreen, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody fruits containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
