    "intro": "Eryngium tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, blue-green leaves and spiky, blue or purple flower heads that resemble a sea urchin. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments. It is a perennial herb that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eryngium tenuissimum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal conditions."
