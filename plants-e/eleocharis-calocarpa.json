    "intro": "Eleocharis calocarpa, commonly known as the showy spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike that bears numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Eleocharis calocarpa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
