    "intro": "Euonymus moldavicus, commonly known as the Moldavian woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist through the winter. Euonymus moldavicus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
