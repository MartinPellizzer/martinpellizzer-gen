    "intro": "Epidendrum intermixtum, commonly known as the Orchid with Mixed Blooms, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with contrasting markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
