    "intro": "Epidendrum nigrivinosum, commonly known as the Black Violet Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety petals and sepals, which contrast with its pale green to white lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. It produces fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. Epidendrum nigrivinosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
