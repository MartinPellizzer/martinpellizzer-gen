    "intro": "Euphorbia applanata, commonly known as the flatleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically flat and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
