It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with rough, hairy foliage. The leaves are broad, ovate to obovate in shape, with a serrated margin and a velvety texture. Its showy, purple-to-red flower heads appear in late summer, forming clusters at the top of the plant.
