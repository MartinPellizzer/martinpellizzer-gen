    "intro": "Eleocharis multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed spike rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in its survival in waterlogged conditions. Eleocharis multicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
