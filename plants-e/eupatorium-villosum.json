    "intro": "Eupatorium villosum, commonly known as white boneset, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Eupatorium villosum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
