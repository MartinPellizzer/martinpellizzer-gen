It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, often have a velvety texture and are prized by orchid enthusiasts for their beauty and fragrance."
