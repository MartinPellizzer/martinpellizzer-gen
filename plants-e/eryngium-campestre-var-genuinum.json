    "intro": "Eryngium campestre var. genuinum, commonly known as the field thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features spiny, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by silver-white bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and gradually become smaller as they ascend the stem. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and wastelands. Its structure and appearance make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
