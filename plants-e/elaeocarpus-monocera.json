    "intro": "Elaeocarpus monocera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elaeocarpus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making in its native regions."
