Its leaves are arranged in an imbricate pattern, overlapping like shingles on a roof, which provides structural support and efficient water drainage. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in shaded, moist environments. Epallage imbricata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
