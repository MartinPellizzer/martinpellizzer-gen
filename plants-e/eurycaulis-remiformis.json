    "intro": "Eurycaulis remiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, thread-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy white seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
