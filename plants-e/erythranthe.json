    "intro": "Erythranthe, commonly known as the redstem filaree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or along dry streambeds. Erythranthe species are often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. The genus includes several species, with Erythranthe ramosa being one of the most commonly cultivated varieties."
