    "intro": "Elaeocarpus roslii, commonly known as the Borneo elaeocarp, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of the genus Elaeocarpus. It grows in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, often in humid and shaded environments. The plant has limited commercial use but is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role in Borneo's biodiversity."
