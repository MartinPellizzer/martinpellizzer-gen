    "intro": "Eugenia pergamentacea, commonly known as the parchment guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that give it its common name, and its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct, slightly tart flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
