    "intro": "Elymus giganteus var. cylindraceus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, cylindrical spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
