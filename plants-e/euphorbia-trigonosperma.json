    "intro": "Euphorbia trigonosperma, commonly known as the triangular euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. However, it contains toxic sap, so care should be taken when handling it."
