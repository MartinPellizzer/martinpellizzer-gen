    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus var. ctenoides, commonly known as the cactus hedgehog, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of cylindrical stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
