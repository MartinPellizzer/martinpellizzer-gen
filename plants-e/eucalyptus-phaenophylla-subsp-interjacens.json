    "intro": "Eucalyptus phaenophylla subsp. interjacens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The flowers are small and typically pale or creamy white, arranged in clusters, and are pollinated by a variety of insects. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
