    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum f. gracile, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are typically green or yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila at the top of the stems, which contain the spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This fern-like plant is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
