    "intro": "Elymus caianus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often hairless leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned lemmas, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Elymus caianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
