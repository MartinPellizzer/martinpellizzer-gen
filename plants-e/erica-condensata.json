    "intro": "Erica condensata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its profusion of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica condensata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
