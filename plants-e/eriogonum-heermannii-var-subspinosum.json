    "intro": "Eriogonum heermannii var. subspinosum, commonly known as the spiny bush buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
