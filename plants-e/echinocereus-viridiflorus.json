    "intro": "Echinocereus viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and its clusters of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
