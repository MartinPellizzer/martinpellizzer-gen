    "intro": "Euphorbia trinervia, commonly known as the coral tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive branching structure with bright red or orange flowers that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia trinervia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
