    "intro": "Echeandia paniculata, commonly known as the panicle cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching, spiny stems that form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicle-like clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. Echeandia paniculata is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in desert landscapes."
