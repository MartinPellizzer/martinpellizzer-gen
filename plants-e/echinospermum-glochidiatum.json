    "intro": "Echinospermum glochidiatum, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seed capsules are ribbed and contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. The species is often found in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and rocky soils."
