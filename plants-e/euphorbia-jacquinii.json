    "intro": "Euphorbia jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in yellow or greenish hues, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution to avoid skin irritation."
