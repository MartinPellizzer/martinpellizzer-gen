    "intro": "Eriogonum eremicum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh desert conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Eriogonum eremicum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for desert wildlife."
