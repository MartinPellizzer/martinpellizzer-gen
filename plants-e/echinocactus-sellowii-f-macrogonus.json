    "intro": "Echinocactus sellowii f. macrogonus, commonly known as the Sellow's hedgehog cactus, is a unique variant of the original species. It is native to the arid regions of northeastern Brazil, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its large, spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in late spring and are relatively large compared to the standard species. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
