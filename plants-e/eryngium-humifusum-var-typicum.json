    "intro": "Eryngium humifusum var. typicum, commonly known as the common sea holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, spiny foliage and produces blue to purple, thistle-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in maritime environments. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate mild frost."
