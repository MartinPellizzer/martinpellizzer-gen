It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist lowland areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
