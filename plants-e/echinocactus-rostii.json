    "intro": "Echinocactus rostii, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and prominent, rounded spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiky form. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinocactus rostii is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and requires minimal watering and well-draining soil."
