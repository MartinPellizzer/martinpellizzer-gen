    "intro": "Elaeagnus ovata, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its compound leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. Elaeagnus ovata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
