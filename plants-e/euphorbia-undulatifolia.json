    "intro": "Euphorbia undulatifolia, commonly known as the wavy leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves that are typically green with a powdery white coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
