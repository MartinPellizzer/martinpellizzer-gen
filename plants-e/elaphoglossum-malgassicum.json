    "intro": "Elaphoglossum malgassicum, commonly known as the Madagascar holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it competes with other epiphytic and terrestrial ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
