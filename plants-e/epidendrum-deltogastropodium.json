    "intro": "Epidendrum deltogastropodium, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, yellow-orange flowers that have a distinctive lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
