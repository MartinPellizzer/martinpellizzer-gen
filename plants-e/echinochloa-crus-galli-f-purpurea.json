    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli f. purpurea, commonly known as purple\u75af\u8349, is a variant of the common barnyard grass. It is characterized by its purple-tinged leaves and panicles, which distinguish it from the typical green form. This plant is an annual grass that thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Its rapid growth and competitive nature make it a significant weed in crops."
