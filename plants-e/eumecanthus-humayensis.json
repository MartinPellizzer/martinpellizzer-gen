    "intro": "Eumecanthus humayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique morphology includes long, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
