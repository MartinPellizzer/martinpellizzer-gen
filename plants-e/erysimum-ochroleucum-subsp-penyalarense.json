    "intro": "Erysimum ochroleucum subsp. penyalarense, commonly known as the Penyalaren yellowcrown, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-white flowers, which are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually basal, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
