    "intro": "Elateriopsis macropoda, commonly known as the large-fruited elateriopsis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and the fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds. Elateriopsis macropoda is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
