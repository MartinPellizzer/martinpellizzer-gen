    "intro": "Endoptera multiflora, commonly known as the multibract euphorbia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Endoptera multiflora is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed environments with minimal rainfall."
