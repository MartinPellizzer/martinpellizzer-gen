    "intro": "Erythroxylum itan, commonly known as the Itan coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by capsule fruits containing fine, white seeds. Itan coca is notable for its alkaloid content, which includes compounds similar to those found in coca leaves. However, it is not traditionally used for the production of cocaine and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
