It is characterized by its thin, leathery thallus with a distinctive, cup-like structure that often forms in clusters. The lobes are typically irregular and may have a slightly wrinkled or pitted surface. The lichen is usually light to dark brown in color, with a smooth or slightly rough upper surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found on decaying wood or bark in forested areas."
