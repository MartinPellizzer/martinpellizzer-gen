    "intro": "Elaterium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved elaterium, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which are typically oval and serrated. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Elaterium trifoliatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
