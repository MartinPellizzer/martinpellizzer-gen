    "intro": "Eucalyptus chlorophylla, commonly known as the white box eucalypt, is a medium to tall tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous underneath. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that turn into woody capsules upon maturity. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sandy or loamy soils. Eucalyptus chlorophylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
