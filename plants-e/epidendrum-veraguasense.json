    "intro": "Epidendrum veraguasense, commonly known as the Veragua orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum veraguasense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
