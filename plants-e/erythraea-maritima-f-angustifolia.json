    "intro": "Erythraea maritima f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea erythraea, is a rare coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It features narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees. It is typically found in dune habitats along the Atlantic coast. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
