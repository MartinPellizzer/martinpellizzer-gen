    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudohypogaea, commonly known as the desert sunset cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem that often branches into a bushy form, covered in small, spiny leaves. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the summer months, which are surrounded by a unique, fleshy structure called a cyathium. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Euphorbia pseudohypogaea is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
