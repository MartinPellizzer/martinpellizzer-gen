    "intro": "Eleocharis lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a grass-like plant characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Native to wetland habitats, it thrives in moist to aquatic environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has reduced leaves and produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed seeds. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
