    "intro": "Eulophus carinatus, commonly known as the carinate euphorbia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed or ridged, a feature that gives it its specific epithet \"carinatus.\" The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is well adapted to drought conditions with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Eulophus carinatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
