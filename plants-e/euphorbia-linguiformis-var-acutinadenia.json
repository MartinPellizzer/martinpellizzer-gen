    "intro": "Euphorbia linguiformis var. acutinadenia, commonly known as the sharp-angled spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cylindrical inflorescence called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced or absent, with the stems bearing a spine-like structure. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
