    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum proles pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the ground level. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This species is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and its unique morphology."
