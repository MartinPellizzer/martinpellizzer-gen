    "intro": "Euphorbia clementei subsp. clementei, commonly known as the Clementine spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
