    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. tremolsii, commonly known as the Alpine Helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its pleated, dark green leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It is a relatively small orchid, with flowers that are often overlooked due to their subdued coloration. The subspecies tremolsii is distinguished by its specific morphology and geographic distribution, making it a notable but less commonly encountered member of the Epipactis genus."
