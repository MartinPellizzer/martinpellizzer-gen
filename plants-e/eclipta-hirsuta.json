    "intro": "Eclipta hirsuta, commonly known as hairy false dandelion, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and roadside ditches. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Eclipta hirsuta is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
