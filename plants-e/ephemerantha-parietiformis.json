It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
