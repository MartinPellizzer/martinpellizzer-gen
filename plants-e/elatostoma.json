    "intro": "Elatostoma, commonly known as the sun compass fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Elatostomataceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, shield-shaped fronds that open during the day and close at night, a response to light and temperature changes. The fronds are typically small, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, kidney-shaped appearance. Elatostoma species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Their ability to respond to environmental stimuli makes them an interesting subject for botanical study."
