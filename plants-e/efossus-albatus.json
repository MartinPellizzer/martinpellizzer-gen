    "intro": "Efossus albatus, commonly known as the white-flowered moonshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It features a tall, slender stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the late spring and early summer. Its root system consists of a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients and helps the plant survive harsh conditions. Efossus albatus is often found in shaded woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
