    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hayesii, commonly known as Hayes' holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
