It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
