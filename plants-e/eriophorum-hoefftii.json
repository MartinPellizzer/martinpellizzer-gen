It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. This species typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
