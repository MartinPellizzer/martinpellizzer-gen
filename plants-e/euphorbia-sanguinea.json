    "intro": "Euphorbia sanguinea, commonly known as the red milkweed or blood euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by red bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia sanguinea is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
