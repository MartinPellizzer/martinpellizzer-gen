    "intro": "Equisetum laevigatum f. scabrellum, commonly known as the rough horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems covered in rough, scaly texture, which give it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, a feature typical of many equisetum species. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
