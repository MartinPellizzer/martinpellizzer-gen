    "intro": "Elaphoglossum inversum, commonly known as the inverted holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium. Elaphoglossum inversum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
