    "intro": "Epidendrum yanatilense, commonly known as the Yanatilense orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, with showy, colorful blooms that range from white to pink and purple. Epidendrum yanatilense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its beauty."
