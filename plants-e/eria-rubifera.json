    "intro": "Eria rubifera, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often display a reddish hue, especially when mature. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Eria rubifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
