    "intro": "Erucastrum laevigatum subsp. brachycarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed erucaceous, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, segmented seed pods. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants. Due to its preference for arid conditions, it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
