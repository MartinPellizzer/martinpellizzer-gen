    "intro": "Euphoria didyma, commonly known as the white euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences that consist of brightly colored bracts surrounding small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and alternate, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphoria didyma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
