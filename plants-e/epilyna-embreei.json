    "intro": "Epilyna embreei, commonly known as the Embree's epilyna, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has small, narrow leaves arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. Epilyna embreei is notable for its unique floral structure, which attracts specific pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
