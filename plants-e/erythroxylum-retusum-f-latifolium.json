It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically pubescent and have a distinct reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, followed by elliptical berries containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
