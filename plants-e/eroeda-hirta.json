    "intro": "Eroeda hirta, commonly known as the hairy eriogonum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Eroeda hirta is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
