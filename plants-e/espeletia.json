    "intro": "Espeletia, commonly known as the \"Puya\" or \"Hogarthia,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America, particularly in the Andes. These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped growth habit and large, showy inflorescences that can reach several meters in height. Espeletia species are adapted to high-altitude environments, often thriving in rocky or arid conditions. Their leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. The flowers, which bloom in summer, are often brightly colored and attract various pollinators such as birds and insects."
