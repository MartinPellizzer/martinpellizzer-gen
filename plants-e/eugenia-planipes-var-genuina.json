    "intro": "Eugenia planipes var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit yield. The variety 'genuina' is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other Eugenia species."
