    "intro": "Epidendrum segoviense, commonly known as the Segovia orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Mexico. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often in clusters. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
