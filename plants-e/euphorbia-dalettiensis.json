    "intro": "Euphorbia dalettiensis, commonly known as the Lesotho spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its arid environment. It is often found growing in rocky habitats and is well-suited to dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
