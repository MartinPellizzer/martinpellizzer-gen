    "intro": "Eucalyptus stellulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green or yellowish in hue. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Eucalyptus stellulata plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
