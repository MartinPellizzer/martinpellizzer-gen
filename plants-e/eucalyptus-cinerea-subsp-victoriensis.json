    "intro": "Eucalyptus cinerea subsp. victoriensis, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that is typically grey to white in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-green hue with a waxy coating. It produces small, globular inflorescences that bear white or pale yellow flowers, which are attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
