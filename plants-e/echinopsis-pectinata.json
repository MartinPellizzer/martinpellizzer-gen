    "intro": "Echinopsis pectinata, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stem and vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with a different cactus species, which provides it with the necessary nutrients for survival. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Echinopsis pectinata is popular among cactus enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
