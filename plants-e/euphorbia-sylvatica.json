    "intro": "Euphorbia sylvatica, commonly known as the common spurge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Euphorbia sylvatica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate various growing conditions."
