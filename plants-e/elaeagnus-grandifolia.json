    "intro": "Elaeagnus grandifolia, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Elaeagnus grandifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
