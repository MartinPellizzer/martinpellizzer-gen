    "intro": "Ebnerella multihamata, commonly known as the many-horned fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that bear multiple pinnae with a serrated or toothed margin. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain sporangia that release spores for propagation. The botanical features of Ebnerella multihamata make it a unique and visually striking member of the fern family."
