    "intro": "Euclea herbacea, commonly known as the common euclea, is a small, herbaceous shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Euclea herbacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
