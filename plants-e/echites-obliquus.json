    "intro": "Echites obliquus, commonly known as the zigzag vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, serpentine growth pattern and its ability to twine around supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Echites obliquus is often found in humid, shaded environments within rainforests."
