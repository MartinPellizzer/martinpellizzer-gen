    "intro": "Endacanthus humblotii, commonly known as the Humboldt's starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue petals. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
