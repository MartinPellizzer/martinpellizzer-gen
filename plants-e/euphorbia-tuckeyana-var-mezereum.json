    "intro": "Euphorbia tuckeyana var. mezereum, commonly known as the Mezereum spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in a cluster known as a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
