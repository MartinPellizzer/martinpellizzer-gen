It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that exhibit a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
