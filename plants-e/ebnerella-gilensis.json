    "intro": "Ebnerella gilensis, commonly known as the Gil's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its rootless, floating growth habit and its ability to capture small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and usually pale yellow or greenish, with two lips that aid in pollination. Ebnerella gilensis is noted for its unique adaptations to aquatic life, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
