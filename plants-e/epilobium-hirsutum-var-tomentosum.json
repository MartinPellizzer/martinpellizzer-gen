    "intro": "Epilobium hirsutum var. tomentosum, commonly known as woolly willow or hairy willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its fibrous roots and adaptability make it a common pioneer species in disturbed or wetland habitats."
