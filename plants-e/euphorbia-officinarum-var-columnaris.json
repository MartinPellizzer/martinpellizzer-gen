    "intro": "Euphorbia officinarum var. columnaris, commonly known as the columnar euphorbia, is a succulent plant characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy, greenish-white cuticle. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its ability to store water in its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
