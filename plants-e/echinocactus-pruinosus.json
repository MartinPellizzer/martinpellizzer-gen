    "intro": "Echinocactus pruinosus, commonly known as the velvet echinocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, which give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the tips of the stems. It is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
