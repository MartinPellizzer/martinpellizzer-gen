    "intro": "Erica diotiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Erica diotiflora is well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
