    "intro": "Eriogonum nudum var. decurrens, commonly known as the decurrent leafleaf, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its leaves are often decurrent, meaning they extend down the stem, and the flowers are usually pink or red. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native wildlife."
