    "intro": "Eremurus olgae, commonly known as the Tibetan giant bulb, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It belongs to the genus Eremurus, which is part of the family Asteraceae, commonly known as the sunflower family. The plant is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, with numerous yellowish-green ray florets. Its bulbous base stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, cold environments. Eremurus olgae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils."
