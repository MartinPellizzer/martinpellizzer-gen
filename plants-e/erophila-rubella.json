    "intro": "Erophila rubella, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Erophila rubella is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
