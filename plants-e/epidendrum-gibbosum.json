    "intro": "Epidendrum gibbosum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes or in open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette, helping to store moisture in its arid habitat. Epidendrum gibbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
