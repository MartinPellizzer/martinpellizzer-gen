    "intro": "Euphorbia ndurumensis, commonly known as the Namibia euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
