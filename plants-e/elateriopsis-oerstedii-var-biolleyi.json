It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and linear, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
