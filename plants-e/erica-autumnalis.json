    "intro": "Erica autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn heath, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Erica autumnalis thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
