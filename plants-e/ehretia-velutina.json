It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
