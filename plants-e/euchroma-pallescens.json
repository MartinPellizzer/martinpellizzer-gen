    "intro": "Euchroma pallescens, commonly known as the white-leafed orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale green to white foliage and small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Euchroma pallescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
