    "intro": "Eriogonum wrightii subsp. dentatum, commonly known as the Wright's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, toothed leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. The subspecies dentatum is distinguished by its more pronounced leaf teeth compared to other subspecies of Eriogonum wrightii."
