    "intro": "Epidendrum repens, commonly known as the creeping epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and long, arching stems that often trail along the ground. The plant produces showy, spiral-shaped inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum repens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest understories."
