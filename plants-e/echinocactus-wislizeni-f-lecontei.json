    "intro": "Echinocactus wislizeni f. lecontei, commonly known as the Leconte's barrel cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often displaying a cylindrical shape with a distinctive spiny crown. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, branched stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
