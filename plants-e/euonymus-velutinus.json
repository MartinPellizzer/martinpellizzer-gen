It is characterized by its smooth, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, visually appealing plants."
