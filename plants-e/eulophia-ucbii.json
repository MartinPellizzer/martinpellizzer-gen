    "intro": "Eulophia ucbii, commonly known as the UCB orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in harsh, mountainous environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss. Eulophia ucbii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by enthusiasts interested in rare and exotic orchids."
