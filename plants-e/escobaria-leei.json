    "intro": "Escobaria leei, commonly known as the Lee's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched stems. Escobaria leei is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
