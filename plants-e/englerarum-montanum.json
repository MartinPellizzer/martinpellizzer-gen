    "intro": "Englerarum montanum, commonly known as the mountain englera, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native arid or semi-arid habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Englerarum montanum is considered a species of conservation concern."
