    "intro": "Epipactis condensata subsp. kuenkeleana, commonly known as the Kuenkelean harebell, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
