    "intro": "Elatine graeca, commonly known as the Greek waterwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branched stems that are often submerged, with tiny, ovate leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Elatine graeca is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters and is often used as an indicator of clean, unpolluted aquatic habitats."
