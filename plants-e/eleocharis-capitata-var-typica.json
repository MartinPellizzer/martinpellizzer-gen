    "intro": "Eleocharis capitata var. typica, commonly known as the clustered spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant features dense, cylindrical spikes of small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are usually green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
