    "intro": "Epicampes distichophylla, commonly known as the two-leaved fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, small, and delicate fronds that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a synangium, which contains spore-producing organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Epicampes distichophylla is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
