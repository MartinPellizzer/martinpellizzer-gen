    "intro": "Elymus semicostatus subsp. striatus, commonly known as the stripeawn wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often reddish stems. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive striated or striped appearance on the lower surface, giving it its subspecific name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. This plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
