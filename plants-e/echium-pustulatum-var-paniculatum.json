It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny bracts that enclose its showy blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically hairy and alternate along the stem, with a rough, serrated edge. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
