    "intro": "Ecbolium burmanicum, commonly known as the Burmese sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical forest environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
