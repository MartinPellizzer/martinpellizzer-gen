    "intro": "Euphorbia terracina f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spurge, is a variant of the common spurge, characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form. It is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in dry, rocky, or disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a potential irritant to humans and animals. The species is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and distinctive foliage."
