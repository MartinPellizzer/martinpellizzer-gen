It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the summer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for low-maintenance gardens. This species is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for native pollinators."
