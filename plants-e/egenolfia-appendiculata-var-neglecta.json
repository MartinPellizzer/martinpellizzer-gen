    "intro": "Egenolfia appendiculata var. neglecta, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. This species is often found in nutrient-poor environments and is adapted to low-light conditions."
