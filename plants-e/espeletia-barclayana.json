    "intro": "Espeletia barclayana, commonly known as the \"Barclay's espeletia,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its rosette growth habit. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a central cluster surrounded by bracts. Espeletia barclayana is well adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
