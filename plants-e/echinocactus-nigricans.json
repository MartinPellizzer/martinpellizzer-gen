    "intro": "Echinocactus nigricans, commonly known as the black spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is covered in dark green, ribbed segments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has spines that are typically black or dark brown, providing protection from herbivores. Echinocactus nigricans is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
