    "intro": "Epidendrum kosnipataense, commonly known as the Kosnipata Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its erect, compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, often at high altitudes, and relies on epiphytic or terrestrial growth habits. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated for horticultural purposes."
