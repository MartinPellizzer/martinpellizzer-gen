    "intro": "Eucalyptus pellita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically during the winter months. Its aromatic oils, found in the leaves and young shoots, contribute to its medicinal and commercial uses. Eucalyptus pellita is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
