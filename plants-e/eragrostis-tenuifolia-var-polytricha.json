It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant has a compact growth habit with tufted clumps and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive blue-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
