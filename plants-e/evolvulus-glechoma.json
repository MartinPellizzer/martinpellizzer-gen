It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Evolvulus glechoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread easily in suitable conditions."
