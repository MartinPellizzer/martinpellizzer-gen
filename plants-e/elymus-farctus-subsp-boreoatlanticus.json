    "intro": "Elymus farctus subsp. boreoatlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, with awned lemmas that are a distinctive feature. It is well adapted to maritime climates, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
