    "intro": "Erigeron aphanactis var. aphanactis, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local pollinators."
