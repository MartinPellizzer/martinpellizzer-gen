It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces sticky secretions on its leaves and stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and prairies. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
