    "intro": "Eurycaulis leucochlorus, commonly known as the white-stemmed eurycaulis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or swampy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited habitat and low population numbers, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
