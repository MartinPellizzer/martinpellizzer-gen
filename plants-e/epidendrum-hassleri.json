It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically features strap-like leaves that are broad and pointed, often with a waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum hassleri is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
