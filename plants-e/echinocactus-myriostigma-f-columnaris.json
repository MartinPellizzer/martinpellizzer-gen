It originates from the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features a short, thick stem with numerous areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. This cultivar is prized for its unique appearance and hardiness, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
