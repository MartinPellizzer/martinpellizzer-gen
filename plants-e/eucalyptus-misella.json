    "intro": "Eucalyptus misella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and rough, fissured bark that peels away in strips. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its timber is hard and durable, historically used for fence posts and small tools. Eucalyptus misella is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
