It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.
