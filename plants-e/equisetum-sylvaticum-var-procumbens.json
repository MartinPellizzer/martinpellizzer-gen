    "intro": "Equisetum sylvaticum var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits a prostrate growth habit. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures, which are typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are important for reproduction. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological succession in disturbed habitats."
