    "intro": "Eucalyptus variegata, commonly known as the variegated eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a variety of colors, including white, grey, and pink. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish or greyish hue. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal regions."
