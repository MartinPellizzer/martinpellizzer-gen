    "intro": "Euphorbia sparsiglandulosa, commonly known as the sparsely glandular spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered with small, scattered glands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Euphorbia sparsiglandulosa is relatively drought-tolerant and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
