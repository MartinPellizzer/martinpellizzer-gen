    "intro": "Euonymus lichiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by distinctive red or orange fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely used as other euonymus species."
