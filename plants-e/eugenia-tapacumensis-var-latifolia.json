    "intro": "Eugenia tapacumensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved velvetwood, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
