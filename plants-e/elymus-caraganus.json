    "intro": "Elymus caraganus, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Elymus caraganus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
