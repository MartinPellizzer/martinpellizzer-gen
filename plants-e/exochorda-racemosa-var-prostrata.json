    "intro": "Exochorda racemosa var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate meadow spirea, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern North America. It features wiry, arching stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly toothed margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges."
