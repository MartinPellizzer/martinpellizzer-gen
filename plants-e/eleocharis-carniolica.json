    "intro": "Eleocharis carniolica, commonly known as the Carniola sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Eleocharis carniolica plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
