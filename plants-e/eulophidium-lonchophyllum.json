    "intro": "Eulophidium lonchophyllum, commonly known as the black root grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny florets, typical of many grass species. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
