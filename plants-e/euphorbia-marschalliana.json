    "intro": "Euphorbia marschalliana, commonly known as the Marschall's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, and often blue-green colored leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, care should be taken when handling the plant to avoid skin irritation."
