    "intro": "Euphorbia calcarata, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem system with spiny, fleshy leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, requiring caution when handling."
