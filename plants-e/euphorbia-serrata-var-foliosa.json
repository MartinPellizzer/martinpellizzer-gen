    "intro": "Euphorbia serrata var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, woody stem covered in small, spiny leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water storage. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils with minimal water."
