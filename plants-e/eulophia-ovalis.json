    "intro": "Eulophia ovalis, commonly known as the oval lady's-tresses, is an orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Eulophia ovalis has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its flowering stems. Its botanical features make it a popular subject for both horticultural study and conservation efforts."
