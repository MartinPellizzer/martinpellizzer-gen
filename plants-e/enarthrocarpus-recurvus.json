    "intro": "Enarthrocarpus recurvus, commonly known as the broad-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiky fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
