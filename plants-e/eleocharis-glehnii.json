    "intro": "Eleocharis glehnii, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Eleocharis glehnii is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
